            "Transcription:  The fabled Mirzakhani Wand is the most powerful magical item ever created, and that's why the evil wizard Moldavord is planning to use it to conquer the world. You and DrumbleDroar have finally discovered its hiding place in this cave. The wand is hidden by a system of 100 magical stones, including a glowing keystone, and 100 platforms. If the keystone is placed on the correct platform, the wand will be revealed. If placed incorrectly, the entire cave will collapse. The keystone is immune to all magic, but the other stones aren't, meaning you can pick them up and cast a placement spell, and the platform that stone belongs on will glow. Place all 99 stones correctly, and the final platform must be the keystone's correct resting place. You're about to get started when one of Moldavord's henchmen arrives and irreversibly seals a random stone to a random platform. If you need to place a stone that belongs on a platform that's already occupied, your spell will make some random unoccupied platform glow instead. What are your odds of placing the keystone on the correct platform? Let's imagine we knew everything about this situation. With perfect knowledge, we could label the stones 1 to 100, based on the order we plan to place them, and label the platforms they belong on in the same way. We'll label the stone the henchmen placed as 1, meaning it was supposed to go on platform 1, and the keystone as 100, belonging on platform 100. Of course, we don't know which platform is which, so the numbering of the platforms is actually invisible to us. There are three possibilities. 1. That first stone was placed randomly onto its own platform, in which case you're guaranteed to succeed. 2. It was placed on the keystone's platform, and you're doomed to fail. But most likely, scenario 3, it was placed somewhere else. Suppose the henchmen placed stone 1 on, say, platform 45. Then you'd place stone 2 on platform 2, 3 on 3, and so on, until you got to stone 45. Its platform being taken, a random platform would light up. And here, there are three possibilities. If it's platform 1, you'll win, because all of the remaining stones will go to the correct platforms. If platform 100 lights up, you lose, because the keystone's spot will be taken. Any other platform, and you're essentially back where you started, just with 54 remaining stones and one on the wrong platform. In that scenario, let's say the spell tells us to place stone 45 on platform 82. Then we'd place 46 to 81 correctly, and 82 at random. And here, we reach the same three possibilities. Pedestal 1, you win, pedestal 100, you lose. Any other, you continue the process. In other words, you're playing a game where you have equal chances to win and lose, and some chance to delay the decisive moment. No matter how many times this process repeats, you'll inevitably either place a stone on pedestal 1 or pedestal 100 before you reach the keystone. That's all that determines whether you succeed or fail, and critically, the chances of those events are equal. This can be unintuitive, so let's imagine another similar game. Say DrumbleDroar magically generates numbers from 1 to 100. If it's a 1, you win. If it's a 100, you lose. If it's anything else, he picks again. Since the odds of winning by getting 1 are the same as losing by getting a 100, this is a game you're just as likely to win as to lose. It might take a while, but the delays don't give an advantage to getting a 1 before a 100 or vice versa. The same essential reasoning applies to our situation. You're debating whether it's worth risking a 50-50 chance of a cave-in when DrumbleDroar reveals his secret weapon— a rare Felus Felucius potion, which grants extraordinary luck for a brief period of time. There's a 1 in 100 chance the keystone's platform was taken by the first stone, and you've lost already. But otherwise, you've got even odds to win or lose. And right now, you're feeling lucky. You Must Win\n",

            "Transcription:  Rejection hurts. It's incredibly painful to feel like you're not wanted. And we do mean painful. FMRI studies have found that rejection elicits brain activity in multiple neural regions that process physical pain. And the language we use to describe rejection mirrors this experience. This is recorded over a dozen languages that relate rejection to being hurt using terms like crushed or brokenhearted. So why does rejection trigger such a strong response? And is there any way to cope with this unique kind of pain? Psychologists often describe rejection as what happens when we perceive that others don't value having social connections with us. This could occur when we're abandoned by a romantic partner, excluded from a group or outright discriminated against. But it's worth noting that these interpersonal rejections have a social element that distinguishes them from not getting a job. In these experiences, we perceive that the rejecting party undervalues our relationship. And while the pain of rejection often increases the more we value a relationship, even rejections by relative strangers can hurt our feelings. This might seem like an overreaction, but just as bodily pain warns us about perceived threats to our physical well-being, hurt feelings warn us about perceived threats to our social well-being. Some behavioral psychologists argue this warning system developed when our prehistoric ancestors lived in small clans and depended on everyone they knew for survival. These humans may have evolved to perceive rejection from anyone as a potential threat to their safety. It's impossible to confirm this kind of evolutionary theory, but wherever this warning system came from, it doesn't include instructions for how to process this intense emotional experience. So, the next time you're feeling rejected, try asking yourself these questions. The first thing to consider is your relationship with the person rejecting you. Is this someone who knows you well and whose opinion you hold dear, or is it just a loose acquaintance? If it's the latter, that might help you answer the second question. Does this rejection really matter? It can sting when a stranger doesn't laugh at your joke, but it doesn't make sense to react strongly to a rejection with little impact on your life. Of course, brushing off even a minor rejection is easier said than done, since how you perceive yourself also factors into this equation. You likely feel more confident in some circumstances than others, and people tend to be especially sensitive to rejection in situations where they have a low opinion of themselves. So much so that they even become more likely to misinterpret other people's neutral reactions as rejections. This is why it can be helpful to both reflect on your self-view and ask yourself if the other person is actually rejecting you. This might seem like an odd question, but you may find that while the other person didn't treat you as you would have liked, they still value your relationship. In some cases, it's also helpful to consider whether you were expecting more acceptance than was reasonable. Unfortunately, after asking these questions, you might still conclude that a person close to you doesn't value your relationship as much as you do. This is a painful realization, but it can help to remember two things. First, this rejection isn't just about you. The other party wants something different from your relationship, and what they want might be unreasonable, unfair, or simply not what you have to give. Second, their rejection isn't proof that there's something wrong with you. The pain you're feeling is just part of a system nudging you to think about your interpersonal relationships. And by reflecting on your behavior, you can find clues to help better understand the rejection and think critically about the relationship you want to have with this person. Every relationship and rejection is unique, but whatever the specifics, it's important to remember that you're never alone in all this. Everyone deals with rejection throughout their life, even those who seem confident in their belonging, and one of the most common ways to cope with this universal experience is to reconnect with those who already accept you.

            "Transcription:  Most countries recognize 18 as the start of adulthood by granting various freedoms and privileges. But is age the best way to measure maturity? I was born 12.05 a.m. on November 6th, five minutes short of being eligible to vote in the election tomorrow. Meanwhile, your big brother, yours truly, was born 15 minutes earlier so I can vote. It's arbitrary and unfair. The voting age should be lowered to 16. I firmly disagree. No way 16 year olds are mature enough to make decisions with national consequences. I'm eligible and I don't even know who's running. Meanwhile, I know the candidates inside and out. She's obsessed with politics. Exactly. If 16 year olds aren't mature enough to vote, then by that same logic they shouldn't be allowed to drive. I firmly disagree. I'm an excellent driver and I've never gotten a ticket unlike some people. That's so unfair. That stop sign was hidden by a tree. I think you both make valid points. And questioning the age limits of adulthood is well warranted. Some countries have lowered the voting age to 16 and cultural coming of age ceremonies are often celebrated at different ages. As there seems to be no consensus on exactly when we reach maturity, perhaps science can give us a clearer answer. One way neuroscientists have looked to define adulthood is by when the brain is fully grown. Brain development involves two trajectories. First there is a reduction in gray matter. Gray matter consists of cells and connections that facilitate communication at short ranges, creating dense information processing hubs. While a reduction may seem like a bad thing, what's happening is a selective pruning. Connections that are used are kept and strengthened, while underused ones are weeded away, creating a brain that is both fine-tuned to its environment and energy efficient. This gray matter reduction coincides with an increase in white matter. White matter refers to connections that are myelinated, coated in a layer of insulation, allowing for fast, far-range communication between information hubs. For example, these paths connect regions that signal the pleasure of immediate reward with regions that help us plan ahead, allowing us to make more balanced, forward-thinking decisions. Imaging studies show that white and gray matter volumes undergo drastic changes during adolescence and continuing through your twenties. But the brain's journey is far from finished, as various experiences continue to reshape its connections throughout your lifetime. So brain structure alone may not give us our answer. Another way scientists have tried to define adulthood is by measuring cognitive development. When are you able to learn and complete mental tasks at the same efficiency as older adults? By this definition, adulthood may begin as early as 16, as teens perform just as well on tests that assess reasoning, problem-solving, and critical thinking. Though capable of making smart, well-informed decisions, teens may be more susceptible to external pressures. Studies show that when performing risk-taking and self-control-related tasks, 18- to 21-year-olds behave much like older adults. But when these tests include an emotional element, such as utilizing self-control when identifying fearful faces, or a social element, such as making a decision in the presence of a friend, different patterns emerge. Under these influences, 18- to 21-year-olds tend to behave more like younger teens, and their brains show younger teen-like patterns of activity. In other words, during your teens and early 20s, your brain is wired to place more value and attention on social and emotional elements. This allows emerging adults to better explore their identities and connect with others, but may also create more vulnerability to negative peer influence and rash, heat-of-the-moment decisions. For this reason, many scientists argue that judicial systems should expand juvenile courts to include those in their late teens and early 20s, as current systems fail to recognize how the emerging adult brain is still changing. So when are you actually an adult? As you can see, there's no exact age or moment in development that we can point to. Instead, neuroscience suggests that there are waves of maturity. As different brain regions and mental abilities mature at different times, so do different, adult-like states and behaviors. Not everyone will reach each wave of maturity at the same age. Each person's journey to adulthood is unique, influenced by genetics, environment, and experience. And no matter your age, you have ideas that are worth sharing.

            "Transcription:  One morning in August 1968, factory worker Wang Xiaoping overheard news of a mysterious mandatory meeting. Rumors whispered through the cafeteria described shipments of a gift from the country's communist leader, Chairman Mao Zedong. And sure enough, managers soon dispersed a gift to every factory worker—a glass box encasing a golden wax replica of a mango. Wang Xiaoping's factory wasn't the only facility to receive this unusual offering. The chairman gifted fresh mangoes to factories across China, leading employees to stay up late, touching the fruits and contemplating the meaning behind Mao's gesture. Some tried to preserve the fresh mangoes in formaldehyde, while others ate the fruit and commissioned wax replicas of their prize. In one factory, workers initiated a strange ritual, peeling and boiling their mangoes to create a holy broth that was spooned into their mouths. Since traditional Chinese medicine often involved boiling ingredients, it's possible this mango wine was concocted as a kind of healing tonic. Soon, fables formed that the fruit ensured a long life like the peaches of immortality from Chinese mythology. And by refusing to eat the mangoes himself, Mao had generously sacrificed his own longevity for the working class. But whatever Mao's intentions, this mango mania wasn't as frivolous as it might seem. And in fact, its harmless appearance hid a much darker truth. Two years earlier, Mao Zedong had launched the Cultural Revolution, a decade-long political and ideological movement intended to erase capitalist thought and cultural traditions from Chinese society. To enact this plan, Mao called on the Red Guards, a student-led paramilitary group. He enlisted them to help eradicate the Four Olds, a vaguely defined set of customs, habits, and ideas often associated with the elite upper class. Mao's dogma was militant, and the Red Guard interpreted his vision as achievable only through violence. The Red Guard acted above law and order, ransacking temples and tombs, including those of dynastic royalty and Confucius. Homes were raided and piles of books burned in the streets. But the Red Guard's rampage went far beyond property damage. They began holding struggle sessions, public spectacles designed to shame so-called class enemies. Victims were accused of holding elitist capitalist values and were often forced to wear heavy signs detailing their crimes. The Red Guard pressured people to accuse their friends and family. They manipulated students to denounce their teachers and parents. They gradually morphed into torture and executions. After two years of the Red Guard's chaos, Mao recanted his support and sent 30,000 factory workers to fight the Red Guard at Tsinghua University. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, these factory workers succeeded, and Mao thanked them for their service with a crate of 40 mangoes. This gesture wasn't quite as generous as it appeared, since Mao was actually passing along a gift he received from Pakistan's foreign minister. But much worse, this reward was quickly tainted by the ideology of the Cultural Revolution. As a propaganda tool, Mao's mangoes demanded high levels of respect. Workers boarded unheated buses in sub-zero temperatures to visit mandatory mango exhibitions organized by the government. Factory workers were scolded for not holding their replicas securely. And in Sichuan, a man who remarked that the mango was nothing special, and looked like a sweet potato, was arrested, tried, and executed. For reasons mostly unknown, the mango fever broke a year and a half later. After the Red Guard was dissolved and participants were sent to the countryside for re-education, the mystifying mango faded from official propaganda. Wax from the replicas were repurposed for candles during power outages. And today, you'd be lucky to find an antique mango tray or medallion while perusing a Beijing flea market. But the tale of Mao's mangoes is just a minor story amidst a decade of painful buried history. Discussion of the Cultural Revolution is restricted across China. And though some former Red Guards have attempted to challenge this policy by publicly reflecting and apologizing for their actions, they still avoid maligning Mao Zedong. Given the current political landscape of China, only time will tell when this history will be discussed openly and freely. In the 1950s, the United States was in the midst of its own political repression campaign. It was known as McCarthyism, and it destroyed thousands of lives and careers. So how did it happen? Trace the movement's history with this video.\n",

            "Transcription:  A cockroach and jewel wasp are locked in battle, but not for long. The wasp latches onto the cockroach, arcs her body and inserts her stinger precisely into a cluster of nerves in the cockroach's thorax. The venom that surges out temporarily paralyzes the cockroach's front legs. She then stings its brain, where her venom blocks its fight-or-flight response. From here on out, the cockroach is essentially a zombie. The wasp snaps the cockroach's antennae in half, uses the broken pieces as straws to feed off its blood-like haemolymph, then leads it into a subterranean lair. She lays an egg on her victim and carefully seals the burrow, which becomes her offspring's nursery and the cockroach's crypt. Over the following weeks, her larva hatches, bores into the cockroach, eats it alive, pupates in its carcass and emerges as an iridescent adult. This gruesome tale is just one example of parasitoidism, an evolutionary strategy employed by most wasps. Parasitoids feed off other animals as they develop, usually killing their hosts in the process. In fact, these insects are about to meet their ends by way of wasps, each in a uniquely dreadful manner. This wasp targets the ladybug, planting an egg inside its body. When the larva hatches, it consumes the beetle's body fat. It eventually emerges, but the ladybug's duty isn't done. It's now semi-paralyzed, possibly due to a viral infection the wasp gave it. The larva spins a cocoon between its legs and the still alive but bewitched beetle stands guard. When a predatory lacewing larva approaches, the ladybug twitches, scaring it off. Many other creatures avoid the ladybug altogether because of its bright coloration, which advertises its toxicity. After a week, an adult wasp appears, leaving its hapless helper's corpse behind. Next is the tiny but fierce cryptkeeper wasp, which targets gall wasp larvae like this one. The gall wasp larva is also parasitic, but in a more vegetarian sense. It's feasting on this oak tree, tucked away in a chamber on one of its branches. Soon it has company. The cryptkeeper wasp adds her egg into the mix. The gall wasp develops and eventually begins chewing its way out as it normally would. But it makes a smaller than usual hole and gets stuck. The cryptkeeper larva eats through the gall wasp's corpse, pupates within it, then makes its debut, crawling out of the dead wasp's head. The final victim is this caterpillar. It would have become an owlet moth that flattered in the cool night air. But a few weeks ago, while developing in its egg, this wasp injected an egg of her own. The caterpillar hatched and began growing. And in a process called polyembryony, the wasp's spawn divides repeatedly inside of it. But a second kind of wasp also lays her eggs on the caterpillar. The original brood senses this and further develops into two distinct casts. What was one egg becomes thousands of larvae. Some of them are reproductives, others are soldiers. The caterpillar is now both wasp buffet and battleground. As the reproductive larvae consume its insides, the soldiers kill the other parasitoids. The reproductive larvae morphs into adults and the soldiers die within the host. Needless to say, the result for the caterpillar is very bad. This was just a peek into the prolific province of parasitoid wasps. Some venture underwater to find their hosts. Others are hyper parasitoids, whose victims are other parasitoid wasps. Scientists are still pulling back the curtain on these creatures. They can be hard to collect and quite small. The world's tiniest known insect is a microscopic wasp that parasitizes barklice eggs. Though much remains unknown, some researchers suspect that parasitoid wasps are among the most diverse animal groups. Perhaps the most diverse. Wasps have been perfecting their brand of parasitism for some 247 million years. All to give their offspring the very best opportunities life has to offer. And wasps aren't the only creatures who use gruesome tactics to survive. Birds employ their own form of parasitism, where they trick other species into rearing their young. How and why do they do this? Dig into the evolutionary phenomenon with this video.\n",
