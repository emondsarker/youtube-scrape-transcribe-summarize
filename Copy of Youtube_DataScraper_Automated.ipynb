In and out. Staying alive is about doing things. This very second, your cells are combusting glucose molecules with oxygen to make energy available, which keeps you alive for another precious moment. To get the oxygen to your cells, you're breathing. Breathing is an answer to a very hard problem. How do you get the resources that your cells need to survive from the outside to the inside of your cells? Every living thing has to solve this problem, and the solution is surprisingly different depending on one of the most important regulators of life, size. As we've discussed in other videos, at different scales, the physical laws of the universe have different consequences for its inhabitants. Simple things like temperature, microgravity, or surface tension might not matter to you or be a deadly danger, depending on how big you are. Living things need a lot of different materials to keep themselves going, and they somehow need to transport them from the outside to the inside. This was a huge problem for the first things on the verge of being alive, because doing anything in our universe requires energy. And the first living beings on Earth did not have the abundance of tools and techniques available that life has today after billions of years of evolution. So, at the very beginning, life needed to find a way to get good stuff inside and bad stuff outside of itself without using energy. Luckily, the very first forms of life were very, very small. And because they were so small, they were able to use a free form of transport that was based on a physical law called diffusion. Diffusion is the rule of the universe that molecules, especially in liquids or gases, are constantly moving around in all directions. And because they move around and bump into each other and other molecules, they tend to spread. For example, if you drop a sugar cube into water, then there is a lot of sugar in one place, and in another place, there's none. As sugar molecules dissolve in the water, they will start randomly bumping against the water molecules and other sugar molecules. Slowly, all the sugar molecules will spread out and form multiple phases of different concentrations. These random movements continue endlessly until at some point the sugar will be spread evenly in the water. The great thing about diffusion is that life can use it for free. It doesn't require energy. And life loves free things. So all life on Earth relies on diffusion. Let's look at the smallest living being on Earth, a bacterium, specifically its surfaces. Cell membranes allow for diffusion of certain molecules. This specific bacterium consumes oxygen to live, while carbon dioxide is produced inside as a waste product. So inside the bacterium, there isn't a lot of oxygen, but a lot of carbon dioxide. Because of diffusion, these molecules will eventually spread evenly, so the carbon dioxide diffuses out, while oxygen is constantly replenished from the outside. But this kind of breathing only works for the very small world, for bacteria, amoeba or your cells, and a few very small animals. Insects, for example, have a fine network of trachea, tunnels with a pressure gradient where air very slowly can diffuse in and exchange gases with the insect cells. But even insects seem to be able to contract their trachea, and at least some even have specialized breathing organs like spiracles and air sacs. At certain scales, diffusion is just too slow to keep cells alive. The fundamental problem is that the exchange with the environment can only happen at the surface, and diffusion of materials can only sustain a certain amount of inside. Tiny living things have only a little bit of inside, or volume, and a lot of outside, or surface area. But what if we wanted to create a bacteria the size of a blue whale and had a very convenient enlargement machine? We would sadly be messed up by the square cube law. In a nutshell, it means that if you make something ten times larger, its outside, or surface, would grow by 100, but its insides, or volume, grows by 1,000 times. If we compare the bacterium Pseudomonas aeruginosa with a blue whale, we see that the bacterium has 10 million times more surface in relation to its volume than the whale. The bacterium has a lot of outsides, while the whale has a lot of insides. If we make a bacterium the size of a whale, our giant bacteria now has too much insides, and most of its inside is now very far from its surface. The oxygen our bacterium needs would never reach the inside before it would run out of oxygen. Our giant bacterium would just die. Still, being bigger has many upsides, from making it harder to be eaten to making it easier to eat others. But the size of cells is limited by the distance oxygen and nutrients can effectively diffuse to provide the inside with enough resources. So, life avoided this problem by forming multicellular structures. Beings composed of many cells instead of one. Because diffusion works better if you have many small units instead of one much bigger one. Over time, the cell buddies began to share work and specialize. Some cells concentrated on sensing the environment, others on digestion, others on movement. But that still wasn't enough. The problem of diffusion and surface and energy production remained, limiting the size these first multicellular forms of life could attain. So, in order to become even bigger, life solved the diffusion problem by having holes and caves and tunnels and by folding in on itself. So diffusion could happen easily in each one of the cells. Take yourself. What you consider your outside, your skin, has a surface area of about 2 square meters. But your lungs have a surface area of about 70 square meters. They aren't like balloons, they're more like sponges filled with many tightly packed tiny balloons surrounded by blood vessels. When you breathe in, all these tiny balloons fill up with fresh air. Blood filled up with CO2 is pumped to a room. A group of scientists just sharing their hard science for free. It is our role in data, heavily funded by Bill Gates and other billionaires, many of which have also sponsored Kirk's exact videos. The publication receives... Who are the stars without ever having to venture into the terrifying dark abyss of interstellar space? Until we build a stellar engine, we're adrift and subject to the whims of the Galactic Sea. We may not like where it leads us. Maybe our descendants will set sail and become an interstellar species for millions of years to come. This was our last video for the year 12,019 of the human era. And what a year it was. So much stuff happened everywhere, to so many different people. Calendars and holidays are just imaginary, but they help us to cut our lives into pieces that our brains can handle. We're leaving 12,019 behind with a weird mixture of disillusion and hope. The world is screwed up, but we can fix it. In a few days, this year will be over and we'll get to try again. Thank you for watching our videos and for sticking around for so many years. See you all in 12,020.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1239\n","\n","Link  82 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/dqwpQarrDwk\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/dqwpQarrDwk\n","[youtube] dqwpQarrDwk: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] dqwpQarrDwk: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 8.22MiB in 01:49\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Getting to space is hard. Right now it's like going up a mountain on a unicycle with a backpack full of explosives. Incredibly slow, you can't transport a lot of stuff, and you might die. A rocket needs to reach a velocity of about 40,000 km an hour to escape from Earth. To get to that speed, rockets are mostly containers for fuel with a tiny tip of payload. This is bad if you want to go to other planets, because you need a lot of heavy stuff if you want to survive and maybe even come back. So is there a way to get to space with less fuel and more payload? A nice thing that solved most of our transport problems on Earth is what you call infrastructure. Whether it's roads for cars, ports for ships or rails for trains, we've made it easier to get to places. We can apply the same solution to space travel. Space infrastructure will make getting into orbit and out to the Moon, Mars and beyond easier and cheaper. Great, but what exactly is space infrastructure? Unlike an Earth space elevator, which is currently science fiction, there is a simple yet promising technology that does not require new science, magic materials or huge investments and that has been tested successfully in orbit already. A cable and a weight, known as a tether. The concept is so simple it's surprising. What if we put tethers, hundreds or thousands of kilometers long, into space and had spacecraft use them as ladders to climb to higher altitudes and gain speed? This concept is known as the skyhook. It works even better if we make it spin. A counterweight holds a long cable in place while it rotates around a circle. A rotating tether slows down its tip relative to the ground at the bottom and speeds it up at the top like a catapult. This means that you can transfer energy from the tether and get a massive boost when released, more or less for free, equal to twice the tether's rotation velocity. Specialized fibers already exist that can survive the extraordinary stresses a skyhook would be faced with. To protect against cuts and collisions from debris and meteorites, we can thread our tether into a web of redundant fibers. Since our skyhook would pass over the same spot many times a day, this would allow small, reusable shuttles to catch up with it. Of course, it's not that easy. At its lowest point, the tether's tip is dashing through the atmosphere at around 12,000 kilometers per hour. Because of Earth's atmosphere, we can't lower the skyhook too much or it will get too hot from air friction. So it will dip to a height of 80 to 150 kilometers and no lower. To match this, we'll need specialized spacecraft that can get to the tether. While this isn't exactly easy, it's still much cheaper than getting a big tin can filled with rocket fuel to go 40,000 kilometers an hour. Catching the tip will be a challenge too. There's only a short time window of 60 to 90 seconds to find a tiny thing in the sky moving at Mach 12. To make this easier, the tip could have a sort of fishing line, a kilometer long, with a navigation drone that helps the spacecraft connect. Another challenge is keeping our skyhook in orbit. As more and more ships latch onto it and pull themselves up, they use up the momentum that keeps it in place. If we don't do anything, it will slow down and crash into the atmosphere. And here we can cheat the universe a bit. The skyhook is a battery of orbital energy. It's possible to balance the payloads coming in and being sent off. Arriving ships bringing humans and materials home to Earth add energy to the tether, which it can give to other ships departing into space. This way, the tether doesn't lose any energy. The more we use it, the cheaper it gets. If we're still losing energy with each boost, we can recover it with small electric or chemical engines that regularly correct the tether's position. A set of tethers, one around Earth and one around Mars, could make trips between the planets fast, straightforward, and low cost compared to rockets. The Earth tether would sit in low Earth orbit to grab people and payloads and fling them off to Mars. The Mars tether catches them and slows them down for a landing on the surface. In the opposite direction, the tether could pick up a vehicle traveling through Mars' thin atmosphere at only about 1,000 kilometers an hour, not much faster than our airliners on Earth, and fling it back to Earth to be caught and lowered down. The tethers could shorten trips between both planets from nine months down to five or even three, and reduce the scale of the rockets required by between 84 and 96 percent. Even better, people may be able to travel in relative luxury as we could afford to invest in passenger comfort. Tether travel would be first class seats to Mars. Together, tethers around Earth and Mars could provide the rapid and cost-efficient transportation backbone that would make space travel affordable. But let's go further. Starting from low Mars orbit, a tether could boost ships to the asteroid belt. The first craft sent to a new asteroid would need rockets to slow down at its destination. Subsequent arrivals might find a tether waiting to catch them and send them back for free. Getting to asteroids cheaply is a major factor in opening up the resources of the solar system. Precious metals and valuable minerals could be delivered to Mars just weeks after they were cut out of their asteroid. They would be the perfect building blocks for our interplanetary civilization. But why stop here? Mars moons are very convenient. No other moons in the solar system orbit that close to their planet. Phobos is so heavy that we don't need to worry about slowing it down, making it the perfect attachment point for supertethers just under 6,000 kilometers long. The lower tip would fly just over the surface of Mars and be very easy to catch. The upper tip can fling ships all the way to Jupiter and Saturn. The same supertether can also bring the inner solar system closer. Venus and Mercury are a single swing away. Unlike Mars, they're bursting with solar energy and are rich in minerals. In the long term, nothing is stopping humanity from constructing a zero-propellant transport network for the terrestrial planets centered on the Martian moons. Tethers are a comparably cheap and sustainable solution to making space travel affordable and the rest of the solar system accessible for exploitation and exploration. Considering that we have the technology to build them today, there's really no good excuse to wait any longer. Parts of the solar system are far away, but they could be very close.

Despite higher prices, buying organic is turning from an alternative into a moral and social responsibility. Organic food is supposedly healthier, more natural and more ethical. But what do we even mean when we say organic? There's no global consensus, so different regions have different definitions and rules. In general, organic food is farmed without GMO seeds, synthetic fertilizers or synthetic pesticides. Instead, organic farmers use more traditional ways of producing food like crop rotation and use organic fertilizers such as compost or manure. While the motivation to buy organic food is clearly noble, is it actually effective or just another costly trend we can skip without feeling guilty? Is organic food healthier? One idea associated with organic crops is that their natural cultivation is supposed to make them more nutritious and healthier. Indeed, several studies found that organic foods contain more antioxidants. Plants produce them as a sort of homemade pesticide. Organic plants seem to have to work a little harder, while regular plants have plenty of help from humans. Antioxidants are believed to have some health benefits, although scientists are still on the fence about them in general. We have no idea if and how exactly they help us or how much produce you'd have to eat to absorb a certain amount. What about organic being more nutritious? Well, the evidence is mixed. Some studies found that organic food can have slightly higher concentrations of vitamin C and omega-3 fatty acids, while others did not find significant differences. Overall, the mixed evidence suggests that there are only small differences in nutritional value. So from the science available so far, it doesn't look like organic food has significant health benefits. What we do know is that eating fruit and veggies in general is good for you, and most of us don't do that enough. Eating veggies is more important for your health than how they were produced. Is organic food more natural? People don't only buy organic to get extra vitamins, but to avoid something toxic – artificial pesticides and fertilizers. And indeed, several studies show that there actually is less pesticide residue on organic produce. But here's where things get complicated. Less pesticide does not mean none at all. While pesticides are supposed to be a last resort in organic farming, they're not forbidden. Most organic pesticides are natural toxins like vegetable oils, potash soap, sulfur or copper sulfates, but there are synthetic substances as well. What's the difference between organic and regular pesticides? Not a lot, actually. Organic pesticides are not necessarily safer than conventional ones. Toxic is toxic, no matter if the substance is manufactured or derived from nature. In fact, in the case of copper sulfate, often used on organic apples, the organic pesticide of choice is actually more harmful to humans. The toxicity of any substance depends on its concentration and your exposure to it, not if it's natural or not. There are few recent studies about how our current level of pesticide exposure affects our long-term health. A 2018 study from France associated never eating organic food with a higher risk of certain cancers. The study was criticized a lot, though. The participants reported their dietary habits themselves, while no actual tests of pesticide levels in their bodies were done. Complicating things even more, a Danish study from 2018 found that the danger from pesticides for an adult was similar to drinking a glass of wine every three months. The pesticides on your vegetables are nothing to lose sleep over. Despite this, we should continue to demand strict standards for our food. All pesticides are regulated and tested very strictly in the EU and the US. Every year, thousands of food samples are screened for pesticides. The majority of samples have no residues or just a fraction of the tolerance level. Right now, contamination from bacteria and fungi is much more dangerous. And on this front, the risk is the same, be it organic or regular food. Is organic food better for the environment? In 2017, a meta-analysis looked at organic farming in detail and analyzed organic and regular foods from over 700 production sources and their impact on categories like greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption and land needs. The result? No production method is clearly better for the environment. Organic systems use less energy than conventional ones, but have similar greenhouse gas emissions. Organic farms use less pesticide, but need much more land to produce the same amount of crop. These mixed results were also confirmed by a report from the Swedish Food Agency. Organic and regular were equal in most regards. The biggest difference was land use, and here conventional farming clearly won, and ecotoxicity, where organic farming has a clear advantage. So according to these results, conventional farming actually has a little bit less impact on the environment compared to organic. The bottom line is, organic food isn't superior to regular produce as far as we know. But organic agriculture also has an impact at a broader level. Demand is rising constantly, and the struggle to supply the market can lead to production methods that are less sustainable in other ways. Spain, for example, grows tons of regular and organic vegetables destined for export in vast greenhouse areas which use a lot of energy, and have other environmental impacts, such as significantly higher greenhouse gas emissions. And because growing demand can't be covered by domestic production, the global trade in organic foods is also increasing. As supply chains get more and more complex to make all kinds of foods available in organic quality, ensuring organic quality standards and regulations gets ever more difficult. This has led to incidences of fraud where conventional food was labelled and sold as expensive organic produce. But organic versus conventional food isn't even an objective discussion. Organic is not simply a production method, for many it's an ideology. Buying organic feels right. People want to do the correct thing for the health of their children and the well-being of the planet. But our instinct to think of organic as good and conventional as bad can get in the way of making the most reasonable decision. The solution could be to stop seeing organic and conventional farming as irreconcilable. They both have pros and cons, and the best way to produce healthy food efficiently would be a combination of their best features. And as for your personal shopping, what food you should buy depends on what you expect from it. If you simply want to eat healthily, you should buy more fruit and veggies of any kind, not necessarily organic. If your concern is for the environment, then simply buying organic won't solve this problem for you. The easiest option is to buy local food that's in season. Basically, seasonal is the true organic. When you come up, an organic label is a manufacturing notice, not a security certificate or a silver bullet for your diet. What you eat is much more important than how it's produced.

Titanic amounts of heat left over from its birth and the radioactive decay of trillions of tons of radioactive elements find no escape but up. Currents of rock spanning thousands of kilometers carry this energy to the surface. Earth's crust is the only thing in their way. It feels solid to us, but it's only a fragile barrier, an apple skin around a flaming behemoth. True apocalypses can break through and unleash eruptions tens of times more powerful than all of our nuclear weapons combined, subjecting the climate to centuries worth of change in a single year while drowning continents in toxic ash and gases. Supervolcanoes. How big can they get? And will they put an end to humanity? Volcanoes. There are many types of volcanoes, from towering mountains to lava domes, but they have two main sources. The first is at the boundaries between tectonic plates, the pieces of the crust that cover the Earth like a giant jigsaw puzzle. There are seven major tectonic plates and dozens of smaller ones, drifting against each other at up to 15 centimeters per year. This sounds slow, but on geological timescales it is a titanic struggle over who gets to stay on the surface. The winning plate crumples into a new mountain range while the loser is shoved underneath into an ocean of hot rock at 1,300 degrees Celsius. The asthenosphere. The temperature here is enough to melt rock into a liquid, but the insane pressures of all that mass keep it a superheated solid. Tectonic plates are usually in contact with water for thousands of years and absorb some of it. When they're submerged into the hot underworld, this water triggers chemical transformations that allow tiny portions to melt into magma. Liquid magma is less dense than solid rock, so it rises to the surface in furious bubbles that accumulate in sponge-like reservoirs right under the crust. If enough magma accumulates, it becomes powerful enough to pierce through the crust, which we experience as volcanoes. This happens under the winning plate, like a revenge attack by the loser before it's erased forever. The second main source of volcanoes are thought to be mantle plumes. These are columns of abnormally hot rock that rise all the way from the planet's core mantle boundary to the surface. Much less is known about them, but in a way, it's as if the Earth's mantle has weather patterns and mantle plumes are a little like hot air rising to form storm clouds. Storms hundreds of millions of years old, made of rock circulating at a rate of a few millimeters per month. They don't care about the motion of tectonic plates, so they can break the crust to create volcanoes in the middle of nowhere that suddenly stay active as the crust shifts around them. The Volcanic Boom Meter. Scientists love to put big booms on a scale and came up with a logarithmic scale that measures the volume ejected during an eruption. The Volcanic Explosivity Index, or VEI. Simply put, it starts really small and gets very big very quickly. A VEI 2 eruption would fill 400 full Olympic swimming pools with lava. We have around 10 of these per year. At VEI 3, we already see devastating effects like the eruption of the Semaroo volcano in 2021 that destroyed thousands of homes in Indonesia. At VEI 5, we see catastrophic amounts of materials, cubic kilometers of debris, equivalent to an entire lake of molten rock blasted into the air. Like the 2022 Hongga-Tongga-Hongga-Hapai eruption that sent a shockwave around the globe many times and created ocean wide tsunamis. At a VEI of 6, an eruption can change the world. In 1883, the Indonesian island volcano Krakatoa erupted nearly continuously over the course of five months. One of those eruptions blew it apart, producing the loudest sound recorded in history. Ten trillion times louder than a rocket taking off heard halfway around the world. 30 meter high tsunamis swept away nearby populations and so much gas and ash were released that global temperatures cooled by nearly 0.5 degrees Celsius. Red dusty sunsets followed for many years. At VEI 7, we get super colossal eruptions, millennium defining events that human civilization has only encountered a handful of times. Mount Tambora was a 4,300 meter high mountain until it exploded in 1815 and released 400 times more energy than the Tsar Bomba. 140 billion tons of ash and dust were shot halfway to space before smothering the world's skies, turning them a sickly yellow. There was no summer the following year, crops died and over a hundred thousand people perished. This is the dreadful potential of volcanic eruptions, with famines across the other side of the world and even centuries-long cold periods being attributed to them. Okay, but what's a supervolcano? The term supervolcano is a media invention and not a scientific term. The main issue with them is that not every eruption from a supervolcano is a supereruption. What makes supervolcanoes special is that they've been waiting to erupt for hundreds of thousands of years. Pressure builds up in colossal magma reservoirs several kilometers deep until it becomes strong enough to lift the rock above it by several meters. Rocks crack under the pressure until they finally give way and billions of tons of gas and ash blast out at supersonic speed. An insane explosion of at least a thousand cubic kilometers that impacts every corner of the globe. And yet, that is only a small portion of the magma reservoir. Supereruptions are like a boiling pot of water, popping its lid off and spitting a bit off the top. Afterwards, the ground collapses into the void left behind, forming a hole called a caldera. Under this caldera, pressure starts building again until the volcano gathers enough energy for another supereruption. But this could take hundreds of thousands of years. It's estimated that one of the few volcanoes capable of supereruptions on Earth could cause a catastrophic eruption every 17,000 years on average. That would make them far more frequent than comparable asteroid impacts. The most recent supereruption is the Orinui eruption 26,500 years ago in New Zealand. With the force of dozens of billions of tons of TNT, a Mount Everest-sized pile of explosives, a huge portion of the landscape was scooped out and thrown into the atmosphere. It left behind a caldera spanning 20 kilometers, and it caused the entire southern hemisphere to undergo a period of abrupt cooling. Though among supereruptions, it's a mere firework. The Lake Toba eruption of 74,000 years ago was a much more significant turning point in history. It released a gargantuan 5,300 cubic kilometers of material enough to blanket parts of South Asia in 15 centimeters of ash and trigger a rapid 4 degrees Celsius drop in global temperatures. It's possible that the volcanic winter lasted 10 years, followed by worldwide droughts for centuries. Earth's climate might have not recovered for a thousand years. The largest volcanic events we know of were not really huge explosions, but floods of millions of cubic kilometers of lava. The grand finale were the Siberian traps around 250 million years ago, a continuous release of lava for two million years. They raised the ocean temperatures to over 40 degrees Celsius, which caused the Permian Triassic extinction, killing over 90 percent of all species. Earth's surface needed nine million years to recover. These sorts of eruptions don't change the climate, they are the climate. But thankfully, we haven't seen anything even remotely close to that scale in many millions of years. So, should you be scared of supervolcanoes? Definitely not. They've been used to frighten many people and are overhyped as an unavoidable apocalypse. The most famous one, Yellowstone, will erupt again, but they will be relatively small eruptions. Natural disasters for sure, but not enough to devastate the US or come close to ending humanity. The chance of a VEI8 eruption in the next few hundred years is less than 2 percent, and more importantly, it wouldn't come as a sudden surprise. However, less powerful but more frequent eruptions can also do serious damage to our civilizations and are in many ways a much greater concern. So, we must watch for slow changes in magma reservoirs, like ground swelling and temperature increases, to get an early warning that can save the lives of people living the closest to a volcano. And there's time to develop solutions that can remove sulfur and ash from the stratosphere to eliminate the root cause of the climate disruption we've seen from previous eruptions. Who knows, maybe we'll even be able to turn this force of destruction into an agent for good by exploiting the geothermal energy held in their giant magma reservoirs. We've done this work for so many other disasters, and we are already doing things we could only have dreamed about decades ago, like sending a probe to perform our first asteroid redirection test. With determination, humanity really can solve anything. So, while deep below us an angry hell is churning and waiting for its moment, you can sleep well tonight. Learning how we can get ahead of catastrophes like climate change and supervolcanoes is interesting, but can also be challenging. Maybe you still feel like you don't really understand how most of the science behind it works, and on your own, it seems too hard to dig deeper.

There are little things you think you should do and big things you ought to achieve. From working out regularly, eating healthily, learning a language, working on your novel, reading more, or simply actually doing your hobby instead of browsing Reddit. But it sometimes feels that to achieve your goals, you have to become a different person. Someone who is consistent, puts in more effort, has discipline and willpower. Maybe you've tried your hardest to be like that, and it worked, for a while. Until you find yourself slipping back into your old ways. In the end, you always seem to fail, and with every failed attempt, you become more and more frustrated and annoyed with yourself. If you believe success and hustle Internet, it's all your own fault. If you don't succeed, you just didn't want it enough and the failure is all you. But change is actually hard, and as with most things in life, understanding why makes things easier. The Jungle Imagine your brain as a lush and dense jungle. Moving through it, say to make a decision to do something, is like moving through an actual jungle. It's hard and it costs energy. Your brain hates expending energy, so it came up with a trick. All your actions and behaviors leave paths in the jungle of your brain. As you start doing something, you trample down some plants and make rough, improvised trails through the undergrowth. The more often you do the thing, the more pronounced the trail becomes. Over time, it turns into a path that is easier to tread, so you take it more often, and it turns into a street. As you repeat doing the thing over and over for years, the street turns into a highway. Traversing it becomes effortless, familiar and comfortable. The more pronounced your brain highways, the more you get used to their comfort. So we continue to use them, which means we tend to do what we've always done. This is why change is hard, especially as an adult when your jungle is crisscrossed by lots of established streets and highways. To understand how those highways are built, we need to distinguish between two things. Routines and habits. The things you do. Routines and habits. A routine is a sequence of actions that you carry out the same way every time because they've worked out well for you. For example, you get the same ingredients for your favorite dish and cook them in a certain order because you like the taste of the result. Or before going to bed, you set an alarm at 6.30 because this is when you want to get up. Imagine routines as being executed by a wise planner. It's slow and analytical, responsible for strategizing and mental calculations. The planner is aware of the future and carefully considers what kind of result you want. Based on that, it chooses actions to achieve specific outcomes, even if they are uncomfortable, like taking a shower after getting up. Routines can eventually turn into habits, which feel much easier because they're basically a sequence of actions carried out without thinking about them. You've done them so often before that your brain considers them rewarding and a great response to a situation. So a habit can feel like you're on autopilot. You don't have to convince yourself to do something that's a habit. You just do it. The important thing about habits is that they are set in motion by triggers, context cues that can be single things or entire situations that give your brain the signal to start the behavior or action. You already have a lot of triggers in your life, like when you see your phone. You almost always unlock the screen or you reach for the seatbelt when you sit in a car. Or when you buy your coffee before work, you also get a cookie, even though you aren't actually hungry. Habits are executed by an impulsive toddler. It responds to your immediate desires based on what's around you without considering any longer term goals. For the toddler, the future doesn't exist and it hates hard work. So when it notices a trigger, it steers you to take this easy road inside your brain that leads to a familiar, rewarding result. If you get coffee, the toddler also wants the cookie just because that's what you do every morning. This rewarding feeling is also how most of your bad habits started. Chocolate is tasty, browsing Reddit is occasionally mildly entertaining. This is why you repeat these actions, even if they're bad for you. Rewarding feelings associated with an action demand to be repeated and so a bad habit is born. While the toddler sounds like a built-in sabotage mechanism, it is as important as the wise planner and actually they work together most of the time. You need your wise planner for thinking big thoughts and parallel parking and doing your taxes. But letting your wise planner do everything would cost too much energy. Outsourcing mundane and repetitive tasks to habits managed by the toddler allows your brain to easily manage your daily life while dealing with more complex mental challenges at the same time. So if we want to change and introduce a new behavior into our lives, we can actually use these energy-saving mechanisms to make it easier. We'll focus on small things, not big ones. Improving your life a little is so much better than aiming high and changing nothing. Especially because small changes can do a lot over months and years. How to build a habit If you want to make change easier, the best way may not be to force it with willpower, but to convince your brain that it's not that big of a deal. By creating new routines and then turning them into habits. You want your wise planner to construct that first trail and then use your toddler to help initiate the action effortlessly. Let's say you want to work out to be fitter, a very common goal. The first thing to do is to break down this pretty vague goal into clear separate actions, because the idea is to make the action itself as easy a threshold as possible. So small it's manageable and so specific that you don't have to think about it a lot. For example, a tangible, controllable action might be doing 10 squats every morning. So you can start by trying to create a routine, but already include clear triggers that the toddler can pick up later on. Remember, a trigger is nothing more than a signal that you always associate with the action. They can be visual pointers like seeing a particular object, like your training outfit. Or a certain time of day or a designated place like a nearby park or even better, all of these things combined. The important thing is that you always start doing your action in a specific context. This trigger is the start button that will eventually set off the action automatically. So to establish a home workout habit with 10 squats to begin with, you could make sure to always do them with your exercise gear on at the same place and time. Like in your living room at 8am. Once you have your trigger and action, all you need to do is repeat them regularly, ideally every day. If you keep going, they will change from a routine to a habit, from a trail to a highway. Don't get this wrong, the squats will still take you energy to do. But the decision to do them will feel much less like a chore and more like a regular part of your day. While this is simple, it's not easy. Many things you want to turn into habits don't offer as much instant gratification as wasting time on Reddit. To make your new action easier to repeat and more likely to be picked up by the toddler, try to make it pleasurable. Not necessarily by rewarding yourself after you've done it, but by making the action or behavior itself more enjoyable. Like only listening to your favorite podcast while working out or chipping away at your taxes while you wait for civilization to load the next round. You need to figure out what works for you. In principle, that's it. Frustratingly simple, like most things you can do to make your life better. How long it takes for your toddler to take over and establish a habit varies widely. It depends on the behavior you're trying to get used to, what kind of person you are, your stress levels and many more things. It takes anything between 15 and 250 days until a new habit is kicked off automatically by its trigger. You won't know how long it will take for you. Starting is the easy part, especially in the first week or two. Continuing to do it every day is the hard part. But it does get easier as you keep going. There are no silver bullets for change. But the science of habits is a reminder that it is possible no matter how old or young you are. Even if you only end up doing a little more good stuff or a few new things, that's still a success. Being a little bit more healthy or knowledgeable is a million times better than being unhappy about a thing and changing nothing. In the end, change is a direction, not a destination. So now, hoping we've given you a bit of insight and motivation, here is the thing we made to make this progress easier with design and science. Please bear in mind you don't need to buy anything to work on yourself. This is optional. Having said that, we struggle with change as much as anyone else, so we've created our own habit journal, as much for ourselves as for you. Before we printed anything, we tested it on ourselves and got feedback from the Kurzgesagt team and experts. The idea is for you to track your habit progress for your desired behavior. There's a tutorial part which guides you through the hardest part of the process step by step. You'll get helpful pointers, reflect on your progress and how you could make things easier for yourself. Once you get through the tutorial part, the habit journaling starts, regularly interwoven with examples, science breaks and reflections that we hope will help keep the journey interesting. Like our gratitude journal, it's cloth bound, with an embossed hardcover and printed on high quality paper. Nice to the touch and with lots of beautiful illustrations, this book is a companion on your personal change journey, however small or big it may be. Getting things from our shop is the best way to support Kurzgesagt and what we try to do here on the channel.

Bacteria on Mars, weird alien fish in the oceans of Europa, and also ancient alien ruins on Titan. Wouldn't that be great? Well, no, it would be horrible news. Devastating even. It could mean that the end of humanity is almost certain and that it might be coming soon. Why? Why would the most exciting discovery of our lifetime be bad? Let us imagine the development of life from its inception to us today as a flight of stairs. The first step is dead chemistry that needs to assemble itself into self-replicating patterns, stable and resilient, but also able to change and evolve. The second step is for our early life to become more complex, able to build more complicated structures, and use the available energy much more efficiently. On the next step, these cells combine to become multicellular beings, enabling unbelievable variety and further complexity. The step above sees the species evolve big brains, enabling the use of tools, culture and shared knowledge, which creates even higher complexity. The species can now become the dominant life form on its planet and change it according to its needs. First, shy attempts to leave its planet are happening. This is where we are now. It's in the nature of life as we know it to reach out, to cover every niche it can. And since planets have a limited carrying capacity and lifespan, if a species wants to survive, it will look for more places to spread to. So the steps above the current ones seem logical. Colonize your own solar system, then spread further to reach other stars, to the possible final step, becoming a galaxy-wide civilization. It's very likely that this is a universal principle for civilizations, no matter where they're from. If a species is competitive and driven enough to take control over its planet, they'll probably not stop there. We know that there are up to 500 billion planets in the Milky Way, at least 10 billion Earth-like planets. Many have been around billions of years longer than Earth. But we're observing zero galactic civilizations. We should be able to see something. But there's nothing. Space seems to be empty and dead. This means something is preventing living things from climbing the staircase beyond the step we're on right now. Something that makes becoming a galactic civilization extremely hard, maybe impossible. This is the great filter, a challenge or danger so hard to overcome that it eliminates almost every species that encounters it. There are two scenarios. One means we are incredibly special and lucky. The other one means we are doomed and practically already dead. It depends on where the filter is on our staircase. Behind or ahead of us? Scenario 1. The filter is behind us. We are the first. If the filter is behind us, that means that one of the steps we passed is almost impossible to take. Which step could it be? Is life itself extremely rare? It's very hard to make predictions about how likely it is for life to emerge from dead things. There is no consensus. Some scientists think it develops everywhere where the conditions are right. Others think that Earth might be the only living place in the universe. Another candidate is the step of complex animal cells. A very specific thing happened on this step and as far as we know, it happened exactly once. A primitive hunter cell swallowed another cell, but instead of devouring it, the two cells formed a union. The bigger cell provided shelter, took care of interacting with the environment and providing resources, while the smaller one used its new home and free stuff to focus on providing a lot of extra energy for its host. With the abundant energy, the host cell could grow more than before and build new and expensive things to improve itself, while the guest became the powerhouse of the cell. These cells make up every animal on the planet. Maybe there are billions of bacteria-covered planets in the Milky Way, but not a single one apart from us has achieved our level of complexity. Or intelligence. We humans feel very smart and sophisticated with our crossword puzzles and romantic novels, but a big brain is first and foremost a very expensive evolutionary investment. They are fragile, they don't help in a fistfight with a bear, they cost enormous amounts of energy, and despite them, it took modern humans 200,000 years to get from sharp sticks to civilization. Being smart does not mean you get to win automatically. Maybe intelligence is just not so great and we're lucky that it worked out for us. Scenario 2. The filter is ahead of us. Plenty of others died already. A great filter before us is orders of magnitude more dangerous than anything we encountered so far. Even if a major disaster killed most of us or threw us back thousands of years, we would survive and recover. And if we can recover, even if it takes a million years, then it's not a great filter, but just a roadblock to an eventual galactic civilization. On universal timescales, even millions of years are just the blink of an eye. If a great filter really lies before us, it has to be so dangerous, so purely devastating and powerful, that it has destroyed most, if not all, advanced civilizations in our galaxy over billions of years. A really daunting and depressing hypothesis is that once a species takes control over its planet, it's already on the path to self-destruction. Technology is a good way to achieve that. It needs to be something that's so obvious that virtually everybody discovers it and so dangerous that its discovery leads almost universally to an existential disaster. A large-scale nuclear war. Nanotechnology that gets out of control. Genetic engineering of the perfect superbug. An experiment that lights the whole atmosphere on fire. It might be a super-intelligent AI that accidentally or purposely destroys its creators. Or things that we can't even see coming right now. Or it's way simpler. Species competitive enough to take over their planet necessarily destroy it while competing with each other for resources. Maybe there are runaway chain reactions in every ecosystem that once set in motion are not fixable. And so once a civilization is powerful enough to change the composition of its atmosphere, they make their planet uninhabitable 100% of the time. Let's hope that that's not the case. If the filter is ahead of us, our odds are really bad. What we can hope for. This is why finding life beyond Earth would be horrible. The more common life is in the universe and the more advanced and complex it is, the more likely it becomes that a filter is in front of us. Bacteria would be bad, small animals would be worse, intelligent life would be alarming. Ruins of ancient alien civilizations would be horrible. The best-case scenario for us right now is that Mars is sterile. That Europa's oceans are devoid of life and the vast arms of the Milky Way harbor only empty oceans hugging dead continents. That there are billions of empty planets waiting to be discovered and to be filled up with life. Billions of new homes waiting for us to finally arrive. How likely is it that we'll find life outside of Earth that is similar to us? Well, that depends on how many planets there are out there in their star's Goldilocks zone, the area around a star where water can be liquid. Because stars come in all sizes and configurations, this zone is different for every star system and requires a little bit of physics to figure out.

So as multicellular life evolved over billions of years, it came up with ways to defend itself. Today, humans have a sophisticated defense network, like physical barriers, defense cells, and weapons factories. But one of the most important defenses of our body is largely unknown. The complement system. It evolved over 700 million years ago and is an army of over 30 different proteins that work together in a complex and elegant dance to stop intruders. All in all, about 15 quintillion of them are saturating every fluid in your body right now. Guided by nothing but chemistry, these proteins are one of the most effective weapons we have against invaders. Many other parts of the immune system are just tools to activate the complement system. But it's also really dangerous. Imagine having trillions of little bombs inside your blood that could go off at any moment. So our cells use numerous mechanisms to prevent complement from accidentally attacking them. OK, what exactly does it do and what makes it so dangerous? In a nutshell, the complement system does three things. It cripples enemies, it activates the immune system, and it rips holes in things until they die. But how? After all, these are mindless proteins randomly drifting around without will or direction. Well, this is actually part of the strategy. Complement proteins float around in a sort of passive mode. They do nothing until they get activated and change their shape. In the world of proteins, your shape determines what you can and cannot do. Because shape determines what you can interact with and in what way. For example, in your passive shape you might do nothing. In your active shape, however, you might, for example, change the shape of other proteins, activating them so they can activate others. Mechanisms like this one can start cascades that spread very quickly. Imagine the complement proteins as being like millions of matches very close together. Once one catches fire, it ignites the ones around it. They ignite more, and suddenly you have a big fire. To show the actual mechanisms of the complement system is a tad complicated and overwhelming. So we'll simplify here. Now let's imagine you cut yourself and a bunch of bacteria enter the wound and make it into the surrounding tissue. Our complement attack begins with C3. C3 is the first match, the initial spark that will start our fire. And to do that, C3 needs to switch from passive to active. How this happens is complex, but let's just say it can happen randomly, through other complement proteins that bind to enemies or through antibodies. All you really need to know is that C3 breaks into two smaller proteins, C3a and C3b, that are now activated. One of these parts, the C3b protein, is like a seaker missile specialized in bacteria, fungi and viruses. It has a fraction of a second to find a victim, or it will be neutralized by water molecules. If C3b does find a target, it anchors itself very tightly to its surface and doesn't let go. By doing so, the protein changes its shape again. In its new shape, it's now able to grab other proteins and start a small cascade, changing its shape multiple times, adding other complement proteins to itself. Finally, it transforms itself into a recruiting platform known as C3convertis. This platform is an expert at activating more C3 proteins that start the whole cycle anew. An amplification loop begins. Soon, thousands of proteins cover the bacteria. For the bacteria, this is very bad. It can cripple the bacteria and make them helpless or slow them down. Imagine being covered by thousands of flies. But there's more. Do you remember the other part of C3? The C3a protein. C3a is like a distress beacon. Thousands of them flood away from the site of battle, screaming for attention. Passive immune cells notice the C3a proteins and awaken from their slumber to follow the protein tracks to the site of infection. The more alarmed proteins they encounter, the more aggressive they get. This way, complement guides reinforcements exactly to the place where they're needed the most. So far, the complement has slowed down the invaders and called for help. Now, it's beginning to actively help to kill the enemy. The first immune cells to arrive at the battlefield are phagocytes, which means cells that swallow you whole, trap you in a tiny prison, and then kill you with acid. But to swallow an enemy, they need to grab it first, which is not easy because bacteria prefer not to be grabbed and are sort of slippery. But now the complement that has anchored itself to the bacteria acts as a sort of glue that makes it easy for the immune cells to catch their victims. But it gets even better. Imagine being covered in flies again. Now, imagine them turning into wasps. Another cascade is about to begin. On the surface of the bacteria, the C3 recruitment platform changes its shape again and begins to recruit new proteins. Together, they begin the construction of a bigger structure, a membrane attack complex. Piece by piece, new proteins shaped like long spears anchor themselves deep into the bacteria's membranes, until they rip a hole into them that can't be closed again. Fluids rush into the bacteria and their insides spill out. They bleed to death. The remaining bacteria are maimed and distracted by the complement and quickly taken care of by the arriving immune cells. The invasion has been nipped in the bud before it had the opportunity to become dangerous. You probably didn't even notice it. But while bacteria are not happy about complement, the enemies it might be the most useful against are actually viruses. Viruses have one problem. They need to travel from cell to cell. Outside of cells, they're basically hoping to randomly bump against a cell to infect by pure chance. Here, they're completely defenseless. And here, complement is able to intercept and cripple them so they become harmless and guide the immune system to devour them. Without complement, virus infections would be a lot more deadly. But wait, if we have such an effective weapon, why do we ever get sick? The problem is that in a war, both sides adapt. For example, when the vaccinia virus infects a cell, it forces it to produce a protein that shuts complement activation down. This way, the virus creates safe zones around the cells it infects. When it kills them and tries to infect more, it has a higher chance of being successful. Or some bacteria, for example, can grab certain molecules from the blood that keep the complement system calm and make themselves invisible. So the complement system, while being extremely important, is only one player in the complex and beautiful organization that is our immune system. A beautiful example of how many mindless things can do smart things together. The purpose of Kurzgesagt is to make the best videos we can and to make science more approachable.

We can't get through the day without talking about time all the time. I think about how we use time when we actually talk about it. If you say, meet me at 7 p.m., no one panics. No one says, like, oh my god, what are you talking about with these esoteric concepts about 7 p.m.? You know, we all know what to do operationally. Time, in some sense, is just a label on different events in the universe. The universe happens over and over again at different things we call moments, and time helps us tell the difference between one moment and another. So what time is, I don't think is the problem. The issue, the real puzzles, come about when we talk about the properties that time has. We have a past, we have a present, we have a future. How are they different? Are we moving through it? We have memories of the past, but we have no memories of the future. Why is that? Where does that asymmetry come from? Why are we all born young? Why do we all inevitably age? Why do we think that we can affect the future but not the past? Could we possibly travel back into it? Anyway, there's a lot of questions about the nature of time that are really confusing, and many of them we don't know the answer to. But what time is, I don't think is one of them. One of the most noticeable features of time is that it has a direction, right? That there's a difference between the past and future. Sometimes we think about this as just an intrinsic feature of reality. Like the past already happened, it's in the books, the future is up for grabs. It hasn't happened yet, and the present is where we live. But then along comes physics, and what people notice about our best theories of physics is that those theories do not distinguish between the past and the future. But in our everyday lives, nothing is more obvious. It really requires a bit of mental discipline to say, well, time could exist without an arrow. And one way of thinking about that is there is no intrinsic arrow of space, but there's still space, okay? We live in a three-dimensional world, up, down, left, right, forward, backward. At the level of the fundamental laws of physics, there's no special direction in space. And how you perceive that is, imagine you're an astronaut. You're flying around in your little space suit. There wouldn't be any difference between any direction you could look. There's no experiment you could do in physics that would point out a direction in the universe, but space still exists. Likewise, time would still exist even if there wasn't an arrow. But here on Earth, we do have an arrow of space. If I pick up a coffee cup and let it go, it will always fall down. There's clearly a distinction between up and down. No one is tempted to think that's a fundamental feature of the universe. It's not because down-ness is embedded in the laws of physics. It's because we live in the vicinity of an influential object, the Earth. The arrow of time is exactly the same way. We in our everyday lives perceive an arrow of time because we live in the aftermath of an influential event, the Big Bang. And that gets us into a realm of the concept of entropy. Entropy is how messy, how disorganized, how random a system is. When things are nice and neat and tidy, they are low entropy. When they're all messy and all over the place, they are high entropy. And there's a natural tendency of things in the universe to go from low entropy to high entropy. This is called the second law of thermodynamics. The real question is, why was the world ever low entropy to begin with? Why was the world lower entropy yesterday than it is today? The explanation is not completely satisfying, to be honest. The explanation is the following, because it was even lower entropy the day before yesterday. And why was the universe even lower entropy the day before yesterday? Because it was even lower entropy the day before that. And this chain of reasoning goes back 14 billion years to the Big Bang, to the origin of our observable universe in a hot, dense state, a very low entropy state, and the universe has been increasing in entropy ever since. And this is called the past hypothesis by philosophers. David Albert, who's a philosopher of physics, gave it this name. So now we say, if you know that the world is made of atoms, and you know what entropy is in terms of rearranging all those atoms, and you know the past hypothesis, that the entropy of the universe started really low, then you can explain everything that happened after that. There's a way of talking about human life and entropy, which I think is misguided, which is that we should think about life, literally living, being a biological organism, taking in food and everything, as a fight against increasing entropy. I think that's wrong. I think that we owe life to the fact that entropy is increasing. Because what would it mean if entropy were not increasing? It would mean that nothing is happening, nothing interesting is taking place. Without entropy increasing, there's no memory of the past. Without entropy increasing, there's no causal effect that we have on the future. You'd just be in what we call thermal equilibrium. Everything would be the same everywhere. It would be the maximally boring universe. But what we do have as a scientific question is, why do complicated, complex structures come into existence at all? It's clear that they need increasing entropy to exist, because if entropy were already maxed out, there would be no complexity. But that doesn't mean they have to come into existence. Think about a famous example where the perfume is all in a little bottle, it's in a big room, you open it and it all floats through the room. The entropy of the perfume increases. But if you think about it, when the perfume is all in the bottle, it's very simple. Once it's all spread through the room, it's also very simple. It went from low entropy to high entropy, but it went from simple to simple. It's the journey from the simple low entropy starting point to the simple high entropy ending point that there's a large space of possibilities where things can be intricate. There's more perfume here, over there. There can be swirls caused by the motion of the wind in the room and so forth. The universe is just like that. Our universe started out simple and low entropy. In the future, the stars will die, the black holes will evaporate. It will be dark, empty, and again simple, but high entropy. It's in between that things like us, complicated, intricate systems that feed off of the increasing entropy of the universe, can and do come into existence. We don't know the whole story there. I think it's a very fun, active, scientific research area. Why did complex structures like living beings come into existence in exactly the way we did? What is the role of information? What is the down-to-earth chemistry that is going on here? What is the geology that is going on here? Could it happen on other planets? Very interesting questions, but one thing I do know is that if entropy weren't increasing along the way, none of it would have come to pass.

For Saudi Arabia, the biggest oil exporter in the world, the drop in oil revenues has left a big hole in its budget. It's a fact that Saudi Arabia is gradually running out of money. I mean, they'll be the first to acknowledge that the sovereign wealth fund has been reduced to somewhere below 500 billion dollars. The 500 billion dollar project is part of efforts to free the Kingdom from its dependence on oil. Hi everybody. On 10th of January 2021, the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman made the grand announcement for the plan of the line city of Saudi Arabia. And this is by far one of the craziest projects ever witnessed by mankind. And while most people are fascinated by the grandeur of the New York City, what we fail to see is that this is Saudi Arabia's desperate attempt to cope up with an economic nightmare. Yes, you heard that right. One of the richest nations in the world is facing an economic nightmare that is hidden in plain sight. The question is, what is this hidden problem with Saudi Arabia? What is this New York or line city all about? How is New York meant to rescue Saudi Arabia? And why do people think New York is meant to fail the state of Saudi Arabia?

To understand the importance of the vision of the New York City, we first have to understand the economic scenario of Saudi Arabia. You see guys, the core reason why Saudi Arabia is super powerful is because it is the second largest producer of oil in the world. And more importantly, it also has the second largest oil reserve in the world. And lastly, in terms of trade and security, it has a security guarantee from the United States and is the leader of the oil monopoly group of OPEC. Now the question over here is when Saudi has so much oil and is also the leader of the OPEC, why exactly are they in trouble? So by the look of it, it looks like Saudi Arabia is a super rich, super chill country, isn't it? Well, guess what? Here are the most disastrous economic parameters that most people don't know about Saudi Arabia. Firstly, if you look at this graph, this is a representation of the global oil prices and this red line that you see, it indicates the price point at which Saudi Arabia can actually break even. And here you can see that since 2015, the oil prices have never crossed the breakeven point at all. And assuming that the breakeven point is still the same, it is only in the past two years, post COVID and after the Russian invasion, that Saudis are profiting from oil trade. And that is because the oil prices have shot up. This is the reason why the Saudis wouldn't hesitate to support Russia to keep the war going. Secondly, if you remember from our Qatar video, this graph by British Petroleum clearly says that considering the fact that four out of the six biggest oil buyers in the world intend to achieve net zero targets by 2050, the demand for oil will slow down by 71%. Meanwhile, as you can see from this graph, the cost of renewable energy has already started dropping below the fossil fuel levels. So with 46% of Saudi Arabia's GDP coming from oil itself, by 2050, when the oil price drops below $50 a barrel, it will no longer be viable for Saudi Arabia to sustain on oil. This is the second and the most obvious problem for Saudi Arabia. The third problem that they have is their growing domestic economic indicators. And you will be shocked to know that as of 2020, although Saudi had 65% of its population under the age of 30, although 58% of this population had a college degree, 63% of its population under 30 was unemployed. So you see, unlike other countries, Saudi has an educated but unemployed population. So the bigger problem over here is no social scheme can actually fix it. These are the three major problems faced by Saudi Arabia, which are no or very less profit from oil, which forms 46% of its GDP, slowing oil demand, the rise of renewable energy and lastly a severe dearth in opportunities for the youth of Saudi Arabia. So in short, Saudi Arabia desperately needs a diversification project that can make it economically viable in the future and will give future opportunities to the citizens of Saudi Arabia. This is one of the most important reasons why ladies and gentlemen, Mohammed bin Salman came up with the grand plan of the Ni'm city. And as this announcement was made, the entire world was shocked to see the cost, grandeur, audacity and the vision of Mohammed bin Salman. Ni'm, the most ambitious project on earth. Ni'm has been billed as humanity's next chapter. In October 2017, his Royal Highness Mohammed bin Salman revealed his vision for a new future. So the question is, what is this Ni'm city all about? You see guys, Ni'm is nothing but a huge city which will stretch from the Red Sea to the city of Tabuk. And the peculiarity of this project is that this city will only be 200 meters wide, but 170 kilometers long and 500 meters above the sea level. And Ni'm will eventually accommodate 9 million people and will be built on a footprint of just 34 square kilometers. And the features of this city will blow your mind. All essential daily needs can be met within 5 minutes of walking from any corner of the city, which will completely reduce the dependency on transport. And the goal is to have zero cars in the city. Secondly, the city transport system will be seamlessly integrated with artificial intelligence. Thirdly, it will have no roads, no cars, no emissions and will run on 100% renewable energy sources. And lastly, Ni'm will produce over 600,000 tons of sustainable food to help Saudi achieve self-sufficiency with food. Now the question over here is, why would someone build a city in the middle of a freaking desert and that too in such a weird line format? So what exactly is the thought behind this project? Well, the first and perhaps the most important factor is its geography. So you see, the Ni'm city will lie along Saudi Arabia's Red Sea coastline, adjacent to the beautiful views of Gulf of Aqaba and near the Swiss Canal, where maritime trade routes exist. And this is not some ordinary location at all. This is by far one of the most valuable locations in the world. Why? Because in May 2021, approximately 12% of the entire global trade passed through the Swiss Canal. And this represents 30% of all global container traffic and over $1 trillion worth of goods per annum. Also, this location falls at the center of three continents, which are Asia, Europe and Africa. And more importantly, the Ni'm city is located in such a strategic location that it can be reached by an eight hour flight by 70% of the world's population. This is what makes it the perfect location to build an air trans shipment hub. So as the oil price drops further and aviation fuel becomes cheaper, air cargo will become cheaper. So if they build a high grade facility to board and manage air traffic, it's going to be a very solid stream of income for Saudi Arabia. This is where we have something called the Ni'm Bay Airport, which has already been opened up. Secondly, the topography and climatic characteristics of the Ni'm area have a unique blend of pristine nature, dramatic mountain backdrops, which are covered with snow during winter, uninterrupted coastline with untouched beaches and coral reefs, several spectacular islands, peaceful deserts, mild temperatures, Red Sea breezes and above all, other beautiful views across the Gulf of Aqaba and the Red Sea. This is what makes the Ni'm city one of the most valuable tourist destinations in the world, provided the tourism ecosystem is set up. And this is the reason why we have something called Trojena project. And this will be a year-round tourism destination with a man-made freshwater lake. On top of that, Trojena will have a natural reserve, hiking routes, mountain hiking trails and even water sports that will take place on this man-made freshwater lake. And then we have something called Kidiya. And this project is all about entertainment. It includes a Six Flags theme park, a golf course, an arts complex and even one of the largest water theme parks in the world. Similarly, they have the Jeda tower coming up, which will be the world's tallest building that's going to be taller than Bhoj Khalifa. And by 2030, Kidiya hopes to draw up to 17 million visitors annually. And now to accommodate these tourists and other ultra rich people, there are some massive projects like the Red Sea project that will comprise of 50 resorts offering up to 8000 hotel rooms and more than 1000 residential properties across 22 islands and 6 inland sites. This entire project will also feature mountain canyons, dormant volcanoes and ancient cultural heritage sites. So in total, it is expected to generate 22 billion Rials or 5.85 billion dollars of revenue annually by 2030 and 464 billion Rials or 123 billion dollars in cumulative revenue throughout its construction cycle and its 10 years of steady operation by 2040. On top of that, it is also expected to support 70,000 jobs by 2040. And just like this, they also have something called the Amala project, which will add 2500 hotels, 700 private residential villas along with the retail area featuring 200 outlets. And again, they also have multiple projects to create employment and diversify Saudi's economy to prevent itself from sinking. Here's where we have the final element of the New York City, which is business and the vision of turning New York into a world class business hub. In simple words, just like in Dubai, businesses will be given tax rebates so that they can set up their hubs in New York. And when 10 years down the line, when Saudi Arabia charges them taxes, Saudi Arabia can make money out of corporate taxes. This is pretty basic. So let's not get into this. And if you want to know more about investments and investment opportunities in Saudi Arabia, I'll attach a Deload document to help you understand all the business opportunities in the New York City. So do have a look at it and let me know what you think. So long story short, this project's total area is slated to be 26,500 kilometers and will link Jordan and Egypt via Saudi territory. Eventually, it is expected to generate 3,80,000 jobs and contribute $48 billion to the kingdom's GDP by 2030. This is the grand diversification plan of the kingdom of Saudi Arabia. So this looks like a promising project, right? Saudi has a ton of money and has some of the richest people like Mahesh Hassan and powerful companies like Blackstone backing up. And more importantly, it is being fueled by the booming oil economy of 2022. So this is fantastic, isn't it? Well, unfortunately, things are not so good for Saudi Arabia. The question is why? Well firstly, the website very boldly says that it's going to have 100% renewable energy sources powering the entire city and it will also be food sufficient. But the sad fact is that Saudi Arabia as of 2020 imported 80% of its food from 157 countries. In fact, Saudi is so far away from food self-sufficiency that the Saudi government is now buying and leasing lands in other countries. And they're also buying agricultural companies from all across the world just so that they can import food from those locations and have food security in Saudi Arabia. And this is because of the massive water shortage problem that Saudi has. And this water shortage is again the second point of skepticism. Did you know that there are only 18 countries in the world that do not have rivers? And most of these countries are small island countries. But Saudi Arabia is so huge that it's almost 60% of the size of India. But even then, Saudi Arabia literally does not have a single river at all. Saudi Arabia runs on two fluids, water and oil. The Saudi Arabian water supply is increasing by 7% every passing year. Overuse, demographic and economic pressure could push Saudi Arabia's water supply to its limit. The Middle East is rich in oil reserves, providing a huge amount of the world's energy. But what it has in abundance in hydrocarbons, it lacks in a critical resource that is growing scarcer by the year, water. Now imagine even in a country like India with 400 rivers, in a state like Maharashtra, we still face water shortages. And there's no solution to the water crisis in Maharashtra. Somewhere people are drinking dirty water. There is well a massive water crisis in other parts. So there's a massive water crisis that is being reported in Maharashtra. Not just one or two of Maharashtra, but almost 158,000 people from 179 villages are in this situation. People are fighting amongst themselves for a pot of water the moment the tanker arrives. Now can you imagine how would it be if half of India did not have a single river at all? And as you can clearly see in this 3D drawing, even the population of Saudi is so unevenly distributed that here you can see that the majority of the people live near the sea. And except for Riyadh, there is no other area with a dense population. And currently the way they are fulfilling more than 50% of their water requirement is by a process called water desalination. And the problem with this process is that it is extremely toxic and requires a lot of oil which leads to a lot of carbon emissions, which is against the very principles of New York City. And currently Saudi Arabia's desalination plants produce about 31.5 million cubic meters of contaminated water each day. That volume of liquid is equivalent to about 20 million barrels of oil per day. And most of this is pumped back into the ocean, which again leads to massive pollution. Saudi Arabia is also classified as one of the most water-scarce nations on the planet. And you'll be shocked to know that the absolute water scarcity level is said to be 500 cubic meters per capita. But Saudi Arabia only has 89.5 cubic meters per capita per year. So let alone food sufficiency, how will Neom achieve water sufficiency using clean methods? That itself is a big, big question. And while most people think desalination can be done using renewable energy, the harsh truth is that as of now, it's extremely difficult and almost impossible. And lastly, while Saudi aims for 50% of the electricity to be generated with renewable energy by 2030, only about 0.1% of electricity was generated this way in 2019. Now most people might say, yeah bro, so what? What if they don't go green? They can still use oil to grow their business for investors, no? Well, that's not really possible guys. Why? Because beyond 2040, we'll be seeing the rise of something called carbon border tax, which means if you are emitting carbon emissions beyond, let's say 100 million tons, then whatever goods or services that you're going to offer in the market will incur a carbon tax. For example, if you produce one ton of steel costing $600, then on top of the $600 price tag, you will incur an $89 per ton carbon tax when you ship this to Canada. This will soon be applicable for all goods and services. So by default, due to carbon emissions, your product and service will become extremely costly in the international market. So no company or investment fund would like to invest in a place that cannot go green. This is the reason why people say Saudi claims are not backed up by practical plan of actions and $500 billion of investment might just be a distant dream. On top of that, another looming threat for Saudi Arabia is its debt problem. You see, as the world's largest oil producer, Saudi Arabia traditionally has had no need to borrow money at all. But since 2015, as the oil prices dropped below the breakeven point, you will see that Saudi Arabia has been accumulating more and more debt. And it's only after COVID recovery and the Russia-Ukraine war that Saudi's debt to GDP ratio has actually started dropping down. And like I said, this is because of the increase in oil prices. On top of that, if you look at their foreign reserves, they have depleted by a massive margin after the oil prices went down. This is how sensitive the Saudi economy is. So if trillions of dollars are needed to fund the Vision 2030 projects, and if any of them go wrong, it's going to cause Saudi both money and reputation, both of which they cannot afford to play with as the world becomes oil-free. This is the story, vision, vulnerability and the situation of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and its quest for the Line City project. And this brings me to the last part of the episode and that are the study materials to help you understand the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, its vision and its situation better. Moving on to the study materials, the first thing I'm attaching is a dog from the Middle East eye to help you understand the Saudi economy using graphs.

It's thinking about thinking. It is not responding to headlines. It's not what CNN wants to talk to me about on any given day or Fox News. It is instead trying to think about, for me, where the world is heading. That means pattern recognition, lots of different macro themes at the country level, at the company level, at the individual level, and how they create trade-offs in leaders that are affected frequently by many of them, but have very different priorities, needs, and timeframes. It's very easy to say, okay, I just saw this headline, and I have a large amount of personal history and data, and that will allow me to immediately frame what I think that means, where I should place it in my existing worldview, and is there any information there that's dissonant. That is completely un-strategic thinking. Strategic thinking is what goes on outside of that. It is how do I create my worldview? What would change it? What are the pieces that I prioritize? What are the ones that aren't so important? Why do I prioritize them that way? Does that make sense today? What's changed in the last 10 years or 20 years? The world changes so quickly, and yet people don't revisit their worldview nearly as quickly as the world changes. And yet, of course, you should revisit your worldview on a continual basis, not because you were wrong. I mean, you may have been wrong, but much more likely is you had some level of rightness. You weren't analytically wrong. The world moved. And if you're not moving, you're going to become wrong. I mean, one thing, any analytic view will become wrong over time. And strategic thinking, I think, at its base is an effort to prevent that from happening. Great strategic thinkers are curious and open. They are fine with being wrong, admitting that they're wrong, talking about what that means and moving on. There are also people that are very curious about different worldviews, people that have respect for worldviews and opinions and analysis that are dramatically different from their own and that engage with them. Those are people who tend to be good strategic thinkers. I don't necessarily say opposing worldviews because worldviews don't need to be opposing. They just need to be different. I happen to be born in the United States, and that, of necessity, gives me a worldview of that context. But if I, same human being, happened to be born in China, would that give me an opposing worldview? No, would I be the same person? I just have a different worldview. People that are much more comfortable simply following folks that confirm their priors may be outstanding tactical thinkers, but are not good strategic thinkers. Of course, this is not easy to do. I mean, it's kind of like going to the gym. The first time is daunting. Once you do it every morning, stopping doing it would feel daunting, but you have to actually build up that training, that practice, and it takes time because your brain doesn't like it when you start engaging with things that you don't agree with. It finds it unnerving, but if you do it enough and you start breaking down your own internal barriers to say, no, it's not that I don't like this person. It's not that that opinion turns me off. It's just that they come from a different story. They're not villainous. The fact that you're Israeli or Palestinian doesn't make the other person wrong. They're both heroes of their own stories. They just have different stories. If you're prepared to understand, accept, and embrace that, then you tend to be a better strategic thinker. Nelson Mandela would probably be at the top of my list in terms of global strategic thinkers. He is not only someone of extraordinary moral courage and personal conviction, he also is someone that recognizes for the long future of his country that he needed to put aside personal vendettas and even the desire to meet out immediate justice in order to ensure that his country had a future. He took the long view on values and ethics and human development in a way that very few political figures really do. My only regret is that I never had the opportunity to meet him personally. Maybe that allows me to lionize him more because a lot of world leaders who I have a lot of respect for that I've spent a lot of time with personally do become more humanized in ways that don't always comport with how much you respect them once you've spent time with them. That's not always true, but it's pretty much true.

I'm a theoretical physicist and philosopher at Johns Hopkins University, and I'm the author of The Biggest Ideas in the Universe, Space, Time, and Motion. There's no question the multiverse is having a kind of moment in popular culture. You know, Marvel movies have been leaning into it. Dr. Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, various Spider-Man movies, but also a movie called Everything Everywhere All at Once centers the multiverse as its idea. And of course on TV, we have Rick and Morty and various other things. So it's clear that popular culture, the stories that we tell to entertain ourselves and to make us think, are using this idea of a multiverse to make us think in slightly different ways. You might think it's the fault of physics, because physicists have been talking about a multiverse for a few decades now, both in cosmology and quantum mechanics. But in fact, as often happens in Hollywood and elsewhere, you ignore what the scientists say and you do your own kind of thing. And in retrospect, the kind of multiverse that is being used in Hollywood is more like the philosophical idea of the set of all possible worlds, that you can imagine literally anything else happening. And the difference is, of course, that Hollywood lends itself the ability to talk between the multiverses, so that you can go and interact or even fight with a version of yourself who made different decisions earlier on in your life. It's clear why this would be so interesting to people, because we've all made decisions. We've all wondered what life would be like if they were a little bit different. So the ability to actually confront a version of ourselves who made those different decisions is sort of very juicy narrative material. In some sense, the multiverse is a coping mechanism, right? We see terrible things happening around us. We think of ways that things could have been better, right? If an election had gone a different way, if our team had gone a different way, if we had not gotten hurt, if we had asked that person out for a date. And this sort of makes us think, well, maybe we're in the wrong universe. We're in the wrong timeline. The idea of a timeline has to do with the fact that there are different things that could have happened, different choices you could have made. And you can imagine that they're almost real, all those different possibilities. And when things don't go your way, or when the world doesn't conform to your hopes and dreams, you might say, well, I'm not in the right timeline. There's another world out there. That's the one I want to be in. What is the physicist's version of the multiverse? I think it's really important when we're thinking about physicists versions of the multiverse to realize physicists never start out by saying, hey, wouldn't it be cool if there were a multiverse? It is always the place they're dragged to kicking and screaming because they're trying to explain what we do observe. You know, a big criticism of multiverse ideas is that you can't observe the multiverse. You can't falsify it. You can't test it, et cetera. But what you can do is observe what happens in ours. And what you want to do as a scientist is come up with a theory, which is a kind of a story, a theory that accounts for what we see for the data that we can have access to. And some theories, some very, very simple, very easy to write down theories, like the inflationary theory of cosmology or the many worlds theory of quantum mechanics, they both explain what we see in our universe and unambiguously predict the existence of other universes. So at that point, you say, well, do I like the explanation so much that I accept the existence of these other universes, or do I dislike it so much that I throw it out and try something different? Both camps exist for all of these puzzles that physicists are facing right now. Storytellers have long imagined alternate realities, right? I mean, both in the future, science fiction has imagined all sorts of different possibilities. And even toward the past, there's a long tradition of alternate history storytelling. The slight difference that maybe is inspired by scientific ideas is treating all of the different possibilities as real at the same time, right? When you're thinking about an alternate history, you're just saying, I'm imagining how things could have gone differently. Now, science comes along, physics, my own field, and says, you know, it's possible. There literally are other universes out there, places where things are different. And that definitely feeds into our imaginations a little bit. But there's different ways in which science can lead us to the idea of a multiverse. In cosmology, which is maybe the most famous one up until recently, there's literally just parts of our universe that are so far away, where conditions can be radically different. They can either be kind of like us, but with different details, or even different laws of physics, different particles and forces and the whole shebang. And then we can start asking cosmic questions about why we find ourselves in this particular kind of universe. There's an entirely different conception called the many worlds of quantum mechanics, which is both in some sense, more realistic and easy to bring into reality, but also more mind blowing. It just says, whenever you have a quantum mechanical system, which spoiler alert, all systems are quantum mechanical at heart. But whenever you measure it in a particular way, you can get different possible measurement outcomes. This is something we've understood for 100 years now. The question is, what happens to the alternative measurement outcomes that you didn't observe? So when you look at the position of an elementary particle, it is here. But quantum mechanics says, but you could have seen it there or there or there. What happened to those other possibilities? The idea of the many worlds of quantum mechanics is they're out there. Every possible measurement outcome of a quantum system becomes true just in a different universe. This is an idea that was put forward in the 1950s by Hugh Everett, physicists kind of poo pooed it. But these days, after thinking a lot about how quantum mechanics works, it's becoming increasingly popular. So this is literally a parallel universe. This isn't someplace very, very far away. This is a simultaneously existing reality, where the outcome of a quantum mechanical experiment turned out differently to ours. And if big noticeable things in the world depend on the outcome of that experiment, you could wind up in a very different looking universe. Is every possible world real? I think that it's important that most scientific versions of the multiverse are not simply saying everything happens. Literally every possibility becomes true somewhere. Rather, there are equations. And what the theory says is what the equations predict is what happens. So if you have a particle, an elementary particle like an electron, and you're going to observe its location or its spin or something like that, the equations will tell you that certain outcomes are possible. Certain outcomes are not. An electron is never going to turn into a proton. They have different electrical charges that will literally never happen. But the electron could be spinning either clockwise or counter clockwise. And the many worlds version of quantum mechanics says both of those will generically come true in different universes. So it's a limited set of things that can happen. And it's all based on what the equations are telling you. It's not like I'm choosing to live in the universe where the electron is spinning clockwise. You don't get that choice. The equations pick that for you. In the cosmological multiverse, again, we were dragged kicking and screaming into this because we look at our universe. We see it's very smooth on large scales, the same number of galaxies and so forth in distant regions of the universe. And we say, why? Why was it like that? If you just run the numbers, if you say, I'm going to pick a universe out of a hat randomly, it would not look anything like that. There's no reason for the universe to be so uniform. So we invented this theory called inflationary cosmology, where the universe at early times is stretched. It's like pulling the corners of a bed sheet and you're removing all the wrinkles, right? So you end up with a universe that is very, very smooth and even. The problem or the benefit, depending on how you look at it, is that inflation keeps on happening elsewhere, creating more different kinds of universe. So that's a version of a multiverse that is utterly different than the quantum mechanical one. The quantum mechanical one literally happens here in the room when you're doing an experiment measuring a system. The cosmological one happens very far away, trillions of trillions of light years away in an invisible, unobservable parts of the universe. And then there are much more metaphysical, philosophical versions where you do imagine every possible world that you can conceive of. And then we argue about whether or not those worlds are real or not. Most people think that they're not, but there's a plucky minority out there who's holding out for the reality of literally every possible world. Why should we trust the many worlds of quantum mechanics? I honestly think the best reason to think that the quantum mechanical many worlds are real is that it's the simplest explanation for the puzzles of quantum mechanics, for what we call the measurement problem of quantum mechanics. You know, quantum mechanics came into its modern form about a century ago in the 1920s, and it's a replacement for classical mechanics. And in classical mechanics, everything has a position, everything has a velocity, and you can measure those properties as accurately and precisely as you want. There's nothing special about the act of measurement. In quantum mechanics, there apparently is. We cannot predict the exact outcome of any measurement we're going to do. All we can predict is the probability of getting different things. And we can't even define exactly what you mean by a measurement in the traditional age-old version of quantum mechanics. So in the old version, in what we call the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics, people said something like, look, I'm a human being, I'm classical, I have a position, I have a velocity, I'm not going to think of myself quantum mechanically, but I'm going to think of this little electron that I'm observing as a quantum mechanical system. And then it became a sort of song and dance about how the classical world of people interacts with the quantum world of particles and so forth. The big breakthrough from Hugh Everett was human beings are part of the quantum world also. They also have a wave function, a quantum mechanical state. They exist in a superposition of different possibilities. So if you can think of the electron as having, before you look at it, a little bit turning clockwise, a little bit turning counterclockwise, then whatever it says is a human being can be in the state, I saw the electron turning clockwise, or I saw the electron turning counterclockwise. And what he showed using that was that the Schrodinger equation, the famous equation that governs the dynamics of quantum systems, predicts that's exactly what happens. When a human being looks at an electron that is spinning, there will be part of the quantum state of the multiverse, which says the electron was spinning clockwise and the human being saw it spinning clockwise. We call that a world. There's a whole other part, saying the electron was spinning counterclockwise, that's what the human being saw. And Everett says that's a completely different world. So the reason to accept it is, it's just what the equations say. Every other version of quantum mechanics has to say the worlds would have been there, but we're going to remove them somehow. And it's awkward, you don't know how to do it, and there's no special reason to do it. So I think it's just simplest to accept that the other worlds are probably there, even if we'll never know for sure. It provides a really nice, elegant, simple explanation for what we observe in our world here. How many worlds are there? The thing about the many worlds of quantum mechanics is people always want to know how many worlds are there and how often are they created. And the sad fact is we don't know the answer to that. We're not even sure if there is an answer to something like that, because the number of quantum mechanical worlds could be infinite. And that's a mind-boggling kind of possibility, right? But it's infinite in the same way that the number of real numbers between zero and one is infinite. You can still say, well, the numbers between zero and a half are twice as many as the numbers between a half and three quarters, okay? Likewise, even if there's an infinite number of multiverses, of universes in the multiverse, you can still say, well, the probability of a universe looking a certain way has a certain number that we can attach to it. And so how often the splitting occurs is just not defined if you think there's an infinite number. It's a continual process. It's happening all the time. But we don't know if it's an infinite number. Maybe it's a finite number, in which case you could attach some value to how many universes there are. It's going to be a big number. The numbers we're talking about are something like 10 to the power, 10 to the power 100 or 120, okay? A ridiculously large number that you cannot even contemplate. So these universes in that case are being brought into existence all the time. One example I like to give is that in a single average human body, there are about 5,000 radioactive decays per second. Don't worry about that. There's a lot more particles in your body than there are 5,000 radioactive decays, but it's a noticeable thing. And if those decays interact with the rest of the world, which you would typically expect them to do, you have instantly branched the universe into the universe where this nucleus decayed and the one where it didn't. So that's not 5,000 new universes. That's 5,000 times the universe splits in two every second. So that's two to the power 5,000 new universes being created just because of you every second. The honest answer is to say again, is that we don't know, but whatever the answer is for the number of universes being created, it's a really, really big number. Philosophers have long wondered about the question of personal identity through time. Am I now the same person that I was a year ago, or when I was five years old? Clearly there's a relationship there, but also clearly I'm not exactly the same person I was when I was five years old. I'm pretty different in very important ways. The idea of a multiverse complicates things in pretty obvious ways, especially if you're not just thinking about conceptual other universes, but you say because of quantum mechanics, there really are different futures of my past self. So then you have to ask, well, if I could have seen the electron spinning clockwise or counterclockwise and I saw it spinning counterclockwise, what is my relationship to the person who saw it spinning clockwise? Are they me just in a different universe or are they a separate person? I think the clear answer here is there's a relationship, but they're a different person. It's very much like identical twins. You have one fertilized egg, there's at one point in time, a single cell that is one identity, right? One entity there in the universe, but it splits into two different people. And no one is tempted to say that two identical twins are two versions of the same person. No one is tempted to say, well, I can kill one identical twin because the other one is still around, right? They're separate people with their own existence, their own dignity. I think that's how we should think about different versions of ourselves in the multiverse. They might share a past, but once they've diverged, once they're in a universe of their own, they are now separate people. It's not weird or impossible to contemplate. It's just a slightly more sophisticated version of our notion of personal identity updated for the multiverse. Do our decisions create different universes? Human beings love to put themselves at the center of every story. So when you start talking about the multiverse and different ways things could have gone, they instantly start thinking, oh, if I had made a different decision, things would have turned out differently. And that's fine if you're just being philosophical and thinking about the space of all possible ways the world could have gone. But if you're thinking like a physicist, you solve the equations. It has literally nothing to do with human beings making decisions. If you think about the cosmological multiverse, the other universes are literally billions of light years away. They have nothing to do with you and your choices throughout the day. The quantum mechanics multiverse is a little bit of a different story because it does happen sort of everywhere. There's things going on that create two parallel realities. But the things that are going on are not human beings making decisions. They're subatomic particles being measured in some quantum mechanical way. If anything, it's the quantum measurements that force you to make a decision, not your decisions forcing different universes to come into existence. After all, you are a body made of a whole bunch of quantum mechanical particles, electrons and protons and neutrons. If you choose to describe yourself that way, there are different versions of you branching the universe. And then you can say in this universe, it appears that this decision was made, but the universes aren't branching because of any choice or decision that you made. You know, it's actually slightly strange to me to hear people complain that the multiverse renders our decisions meaningless in some way. You know, before quantum mechanics ever came along, the theory that we thought was right was classical mechanics. And classical mechanics is perfectly deterministic. If you knew the state of the universe completely at any one moment in time, everything that happens in the future is 100% determined. Once quantum mechanics comes along, you say, well, you can't predict everything, but we don't know whether the underlying laws of physics are deterministic or not. They could be truly random, or like in the many worlds theory, they're deterministic, but we don't know what universe we're in. So for us, for all intents and purposes, it's random. The thing is, either way, there are laws of physics. The point is not whether or not the laws of physics are deterministic or not. The point is not whether or not there's only one universe or many. The point is, do we human beings obey the laws of physics? And if we do, then we do what the equations say. And if we don't, I have no idea what's going on. I have no idea how human beings can fail to obey the laws of physics, but that is something you can at least imagine. I have no trouble accepting both that I as a human being obey the laws of physics and that my life has meaning, because I don't know what the position and velocity of every single atom in my body is at my level, the level that I can describe the world, make choices for myself. I am an agent with responsibility for what I do. Even in the quantum mechanical multiverse, I can say I'm going to turn left or turn right. That's a meaningful decision. There might be another version of me that did the other thing, but maybe the probability of being that person was 0.00001. So who cares? I think that whether or not you believe in the multiverse, it doesn't really affect how you go through your life. It's not going to get you out of responsibility for anything bad you did, nor will it take away the credit you get for anything good that you might do. Why are we drawn to the multiverse and how does technology propel it? I do think that we're increasingly thinking of how things could have been different and technology is helping us along the way. We're sort of peeking into alternate realities that didn't come true. Certainly, TV and movies help us with this. Either a dating show or a reality show or on the internet, a dating app where we can think about dating different people. And where it shifts from a useful function, a dating app, to voyeurism is people who just look at profiles in the dating app without any intention of dating anybody. They just want to imagine what it would be like. I recently was hunting for a new house. So there's plenty of websites where you can look at different houses like Zillow. Apparently, there's a whole genre of Zillow porn, which is not actually pornography. It's just getting kicks out of looking at houses you can't afford on Zillow and imagining what it would be like to live there. And this is something again that we just couldn't do in the same way. Technology is letting us see what we're missing in some ways. And I don't know if that's psychologically good or bad, but it definitely leads us to imagine alternative universes in a more vivid way than was previously possible. I absolutely believe we can imagine thinking about the multiverse as a useful psychological tool or personal tool, right? Visualization exercises have been part of psychology for a long time. Imagine yourself in a different set of circumstances. And we know one result of modern neuroscience is that the human brain, the human mind, is not just software running on a computer. Our minds, who we are, are embedded in our bodies. And so when we physically imagine ourselves embodied in a different set of circumstances, we think about that possibility differently. And the multiverse is sort of a nudge in that direction. And maybe you can argue that technology these days is making that more possible with virtual realities, with alternate ways of thinking about ourselves, augmented reality, just wearing a headset in the world that we're in, boosting it up a notch a little bit. These could be both positive and negative psychological tools. If we use them in the right way by imagining the way things could have gone better and then saying, okay, what do I need to do to increase the chances that next time it actually will go better? One of the nice things about the multiverse idea is we can imagine undoing the decisions we made, or at least seeing what it was like. Almost every multiverse movie is going to have the moral of the story at the end that you did everything right. Don't be jealous of those other universes. You're doing fine. Even in Everything Everywhere All at Once, that was directly written by the Daniels, who I interviewed for my podcast, they literally say in the movie that Evelyn, the protagonist, is the worst version of herself in all the different multiverses. But still, she's doing okay. She can recover that universe that she's in. And I think it's a little bit of wishful thinking to imagine ourselves doing a little bit better in some other universe. But it's psychologically not healthy to push that too far, because there are some decisions we can't undo. This is why we talked about the serenity prayer, the ability to recognize what we can change, what we can't, and accept the things that we can't, as well as to be able to tell the difference. You can imagine in a multiverse, having made all sorts of different decisions, but in fact, there's no such thing as time travel in the real world. You cannot actually go back and remake the decisions differently. It's fine to imagine all sorts of possibilities, but at the end of the day, we have to live and affect the universe that we're in. Psychologists talk about different orientations that people have vis-a-vis time. You might have heard of the marshmallow test, right? A little kid has been put a marshmallow in front of them, and they say, you know, I'm going to go out of the room. If you cannot eat the marshmallow, you'll get two marshmallows when I come back, and different kids either eat the marshmallow or don't. And the claim is that you can predict this kid's future trajectory on the basis of what they did on the marshmallow test, because the way that they think about it is some people are just intrinsically right about now, like the present moment. I just want to do what gives me pleasure right here. Some people are past-oriented. They're constantly dwelling on, you know, their memories, both good and bad. They're living in the past. We've all met people like this. Some of us are. And others are future-oriented. Others are like, well, whatever happened in the past, whatever's happening right now, what I'm going to do is save for the future, plan for the future, thinking about making future me as happy as possible. I'm not going to comment on the relative psychological benefits of these different orientations to time, but you can clearly see how sometimes you'll get in a rut. Sometimes the orientation you have will lead you to make a mistake, right? A past-oriented person can get lost in dwelling, in the mistakes they made, the important decisions that define their lives, and forget about the possibilities in the future. The future-oriented person can forget about having fun right now. They're constantly saving for a day that may never come. I think that really, let's put it this way, I like to think, maybe I'm being a physicist here more than a human being, but I like to think that by contemplating all of these different possibilities, past, present, and future, we can put things in perspective a little bit. We can think about how, yeah, there was that moment when things went terribly wrong, either maybe I did something wrong or there was an unforeseen event that I couldn't have controlled, but you know what? The causal influence I have on the world only extends toward the future. The choices I can make right now will have an impact that I will feel down the road, but I cannot make a choice right now that undoes what happened in the past. I think this is a truth about physics and cosmology and the world, and psychologically it's a very important principle to keep in mind. What is time? The question of what time is, I think, is easier than sometimes people make it out to be. Saint Augustine, of all people, wrote a famous essay on the meaning of time, and he says, you know, I know what it is until you ask me what it is, and then I have no idea what time really is. But I think about how we use time when we actually talk about it. If you say, meet me at 7 p.m., no one panics. No one says, like, oh my god, what are you talking about with these esoteric concepts about 7 p.m.? You know, we all know what to do operationally, and time in some sense is just a label on different events in the universe. The universe happens over and over again at different things we call moments, and time helps us tell the difference between one moment and another. So what time is, I don't think is the problem. The issue, the real puzzles, come about when we talk about the properties that time has. We have a past, we have a present, we have a future. How are they different? Are we moving through it? We have memories of the past, but we have no memories of the future. Why is that? Where does that asymmetry come from? Why are we all born young? Why do we all inevitably age? Why do we think that we can affect the future but not the past? Could we possibly travel back into it? Anyway, there's a lot of questions about the nature of time that are really confusing, and many of them we don't know the answer to, but what time is, I don't think is one of them. The idea that time has an arrow is so deeply ingrained in how we think about time that it really requires a bit of mental discipline to say, well, time could exist without an arrow, right? We could have time even if there were no difference between past and future. And one way of thinking about that is there is no intrinsic arrow of space, but there's still space, okay? We live in a three-dimensional world, up, down, left, right, forward, backward. At the level of the fundamental laws of physics, there's no special direction in space. And how you perceive that is, imagine you're an astronaut, you're flying around in your little space suit, there wouldn't be any difference between any direction you could look. There's no experiment you could do in physics that would point out a direction in the universe, but space still exists. Likewise, time would still exist even if there wasn't an arrow. But here on Earth, we do have an arrow of space. If I pick up a coffee cup and let it go, it will always fall down. There's clearly a distinction between up and down. No one is tempted to think that the arrow of space, at least no one in this century, is tempted to think that that's a fundamental feature of the universe. We all know why things fall down. It's not because downness is embedded in the laws of physics. It's because we live in the vicinity of an influential object, the Earth. And we can even imagine it wasn't there. We can put ourselves in an alternative universe where we're floating in outer space. Here on the ground, there's an arrow of space, but it's clearly because of the Earth, not because of the fundamental nature of reality. The arrow of time is exactly the same way. We in our everyday lives perceive an arrow of time because we live in the aftermath of an influential event, the Big Bang. That Big Bang set up the universe for its subsequent evolution. We're about 14 billion years after. We're going to go for many, many, many billions of years toward the future. So the universe is still young in some sense. We're still very much feeling that influence of the Big Bang. We're nowhere near relaxing to the ultimate state the universe will be in. But that doesn't mean the arrow of time is a feature of the fundamental laws of physics. It's just a feature of our local neighborhood a mere 14 billion years after the Big Bang. Lexicographers will tell you that time, the word T-I-M-E, is the most used noun in the English language. We can't get through the day without talking about time all the time. There you go. There's an example. And part of it we take for granted. We think that there's certain things about time that are just natural, like the fact that we can affect the future, but not the past. Like the fact that we're all a year older now than we were a year ago. And so one of the most noticeable features of time is that it has a direction, right? That there's a difference between the past and future. Sometimes we think about this as just an intrinsic feature of reality. Like the past already happened. It's in the books. The future is up for grabs. It hasn't happened yet. And the present is where we live. But then along comes physics. Along come Isaac Newton and Albert Einstein and all these great brains. And they think about how to describe what happens in the world. And they give us equations. They give us theories of physics. And what people notice about our best theories of physics is that those theories do not distinguish between the past and the future. They do not have any intrinsic difference between yesterday and tomorrow. They're all created equal in some sense. There is no deep down in the laws of physics distinction between moving toward the past and moving toward the future. But in our everyday lives, nothing is more obvious than the distinction between the past and the future. So why is that? And the answer is the world of our experience, the macroscopic world in which we find ourselves, is a little bit different than the microscopic world of fundamental physics. If you have just a few moving parts in a system, it doesn't need to be microscopic. Think about the earth going around the sun or a pendulum swinging back and forth. These systems don't have what is called an arrow of time. If I make a movie of a pendulum swinging back and forth and I play it to you backwards, you don't know that it's going back and forth. It's still going back and forth. You don't know that I played it backwards. There's no directionality there to time. But if I throw a rock into a pond and I make a movie of that, if I play that backwards, you know it's obviously reversed because rocks do not get thrown out of ponds randomly. This arrow of time, this directionality is a purely macroscopic big world phenomenon that comes about by having many moving parts. And that gets us into a realm of the concept of entropy. Entropy is what physicists talk about when they talk about how messy, how disorganized, how random a system is. When things are nice and neat and tidy, they are low entropy. When they're all messy and all over the place, they are high entropy. And there's a natural tendency of things in the universe to go from low entropy to high entropy. This is called the second law of thermodynamics, a very important feature of the macroscopic world. But it's not there in the fundamental laws of physics. It's just there in the macro world. And why is it there? Why is it that entropy tends to increase over time? Well, for one thing, there are many more ways to be high entropy than to be low entropy. There are many more ways for your room to be a mess than for it to be cleaned up. So if you have a system that you're not directing toward a nice, organized, low entropy state, it will naturally tend to move toward higher entropy. The real question is, why was the world ever low entropy to begin with? If there are many more ways to be high entropy, why do we see orderly things around us at all? Why was the world lower entropy yesterday than it is today? And the only and the correct answer is because it was even lower entropy the day before yesterday. And why was the universe even lower entropy the day before yesterday? Because it was even lower entropy the day before that. And this chain of reasoning goes back 14 billion years to the Big Bang, to the origin of our observable universe in a hot, dense state, which looks kind of disorganized. But if you run the numbers, it's actually a very special, very delicate, very unusual state for the universe to begin in. A very low entropy state, and the universe has been increasing in entropy ever since. Now, that's all well-established stuff. No one agrees with that. Here's the radical claim that I think is true, but we haven't quite internalized yet. The only reason why in our everyday lives we think of the past and future as different is because entropy was lower in the past and will be higher in the future. And that's ultimately because it was low near the Big Bang. The universe was orderly 14 billion years ago. So the reason why, as you scramble your eggs, you will see eggs breaking and turning into scrambled eggs, but never scrambled eggs reforming into an unbroken egg, is ultimately because of what was happening at the Big Bang 14 billion years ago. People don't think of it that way. Everyone knew that we were all getting older, that we all had memories of the past and not of the future. They knew that thousands of years ago. They didn't know it was because the universe was orderly near the Big Bang. Now we know, and we're still struggling a little bit to quite come to terms with what all that means. What is the past hypothesis? We've known about entropy and the second law of thermodynamics since the middle of the 19th century. In fact, it's a very down-to-earth thing. People were trying to build better steam engines at the time. It was the industrial revolution and they kept finding that no matter what they did, they were losing some energy. There was no perfect cycle that could drive their steam engine. And ultimately they realized that a law of nature was at work. There was no way to make a perfectly efficient steam engine. There's always some loss, some dissipation. And we now interpret that as an increase of entropy over time. And so people put together the laws of thermodynamics. The first law is that the total energy is conserved. The second law is that entropy, however, is increasing. So if you think about it as useful energy and useless energy, there's a finite amount of useful energy in the universe and it's constantly being turned into useless energy as we burn our fuel, as we go through and increase the entropy of the universe. So that was pretty well established. Entropy increases with time. But then if you go through the math, you can derive the fact that this could happen. This was the great insight from Ludwig Boltzmann, who was an Austrian physicist. He said, you don't need to posit as a separate law of nature that entropy increases. I can explain why entropy increases if you believe that we're made of atoms. So we're talking about the 1870s. And physicists at the time didn't believe the universe was made of atoms. The chemists did. The chemists had caught on because they saw their reactions happening with certain frequencies. And they said, ah, discrete units are rearranging themselves. The physicists were more skeptical. Boltzmann and some of his friends said, if you believe in atoms, I can explain why entropy increases. There's just more ways for the universe to be high entropy than to be low entropy. Great. But it only explains why the entropy of the universe will be higher tomorrow than it is today. It does not explain why the universe was lower entropy in the past. And because we're very bad about reasoning about time, it's taken us decades of work to really narrow down why it is that entropy was lower in the past. And the explanation is not completely satisfying, to be honest. The explanation is the following. It started out really, really low near the Big Bang. Entropy of the universe just started out low. We don't know why. It just did. And this is called the past hypothesis by philosophers. David Albert, who's a philosopher of physics, gave it this name. It was sort of name checked by other people as an idea, but not really highlighted. People like Richard Feynman and Arthur Eddington, even Boltzmann himself, thought about it. So the idea was in the air, but it wasn't written down as an important part of our understanding of the rules of thermodynamics until pretty recently, until the past couple decades. So now we say, if you know that the world is made of atoms, and you know what entropy is in terms of rearranging all those atoms, and you know the past hypothesis that the entropy of the universe started really low, then you can explain everything that happened after that. If you believe this dramatic claim that all of the reason why the past and future had any differences between them is because entropy is increasing, then that also goes for our feeling that time is flowing or that we are flowing through time. People talk about it, or cultures actually talk about it in different ways. But the idea that we're moving through time, that we move from yesterday to today to tomorrow, where does that come from? And it's a great question because it clearly involves both psychology, it's a feeling, right? But also physics, because it's a different feeling about the past than about the future, and all of those differences come from entropy increasing. So why is it that we feel that time is flowing if really, from the physics point of view, there's no difference between one moment of time and another? Well, the answer is at any one moment of time, the human brain is sort of reaching out to other moments of time, not physically reaching out, but it's carrying inside itself, a version of what it thought happened a little bit ago, and what it predicts will happen a moment next. The human brain in some sense, all brains, all animal brains, maybe even plant nervous systems, if you want to go that far, are trying to understand and predict their environment. They have information coming in, and information only comes in from the past, and also if you're an animal anyway, you're going to act, right? You're going to behave in some way. So what the brain does is predict what it will do next, and at every moment of time, it remembers what it just did, and it also compares what it thought was going to happen. You know, when you put your hand on a surface, you thought it was going to be cool or hot or whatever, and then it is one of those or another, and you're remembering the difference between what you predicted and what actually happened. And at every moment in time, you're updating. You're going, ah, I thought this was going to happen, it was going to be this, that informs what I think will happen next, and the brain is just a sort of prediction and updating machine. And that whole process has a directionality in time, because all of your information is from the past. It's an old Mitch Hedberg joke. He says, his friend shows him a picture and says, this is a picture of me when I was younger. Aren't all pictures of you when you were younger? Yes, all of the photographs, all the memories we have are of the past. That gives us an imbalance to how we flow through time, and that leaves that psychological feeling we all have. Why is entropy essential to living? There's a way of talking about human life and entropy, which I think is misguided, which is that we should think about life, literally living, being a biological organism, taking in food and everything, as a fight against increasing entropy. I think that's wrong. I think that we owe life to the fact that entropy is increasing, because what would it mean if entropy were not increasing? It would mean that nothing is happening, nothing interesting is taking place, and that's happening. Nothing interesting is taking place. Without entropy increasing, there's no memory of the past. Without entropy increasing, there's no causal effect that we have on the future. You'd just be in what we call thermal equilibrium. Everything would be the same everywhere. It would be the maximally boring universe. But what we do have as a scientific question is, why do complicated, complex structures come into existence at all? It's clear that they need increasing entropy to exist, because if entropy were already maxed out, there would be no complexity. But that doesn't mean they have to come into existence. Think about a very simple example of entropy increasing. If you have a famous example that Boltzmann talked about where he opens a bottle of perfume, and the perfume is all in a little bottle, it's in a big room, you open it and it all floats through the room. The entropy of the perfume increases. But if you think about it, when the perfume is all in the bottle, it's very simple. That's a very simple configuration. No perfume outside, all the perfume inside. Once it's all spread through the room, it's also very simple. It went from low entropy to high entropy, but it went from simple to simple. It's in between. It's the journey from the simple, low entropy starting point to the simple high entropy ending point that there's a large space of possibilities where things can be intricate. There's more perfume here, over there. There can be the swirls of Eddie and Eddie's caused by the motion of the wind in the room and so forth. The universe is just like that. Our universe started out simple and low entropy. In the future, the stars will die, the black holes will evaporate. It'll be dark, empty, and again, simple, but high entropy. So the universe goes from simple and low entropy to simple and high entropy. And it's in between that things like us, complicated, intricate systems that feed off of the increasing entropy of the universe can and do come into existence. We don't know the whole story there. I think it's a very fun, active scientific research area. Why did complex structures like living beings come into existence in exactly the way we did? What is the role of information? What is the down to earth chemistry that is going on here? What is the geology that is going on here? Could it happen on other planets? Very interesting questions. But one thing I do know is that if entropy weren't increasing along the way, none of it would have come to pass. Why are there complex structures in the universe? I think that once you learn about the second law of thermodynamics, it can be a little depressing. You've been told that there's a fundamental feature of reality that disorder increases, that things just wind down, right? That batteries run out, the cream and coffee mixed together, that ice cubes melt. It's kind of a depressing view of the future. And then when you think about it just a little bit more, that depression becomes a little bit sharper because you're saying, well, how did all this interestingness come about in the first place? If the whole thing that reality does is just move closer and closer to complete disorder, then how did something as exquisitely organized as a human being come about? And there's a sort of cheap and wrong version of this, which says here on earth, the biosphere somehow came into existence, even though the early earth had no life on it. Doesn't that violate the second law of thermodynamics? That's obviously not true, because the second law refers to closed systems, systems that are not interacting with the outside world. The earth is not a closed system. We get light from the sun, we radiate it back out into space, so it just doesn't apply there. But all that says is that it's okay for the entropy of the biosphere to either go up or down. It doesn't say why it was in fact the case that we went from no life on the surface of the earth to the rich environment that we find around us today. Do complex structures require design? As human beings, we definitely have this experience of creating something very complicated, right? We can build things. And in fact, we get the idea that when you see complicated things, it's because someone built them. That's a very familiar thing for us to think. So William Paley was a British theologian who built this idea into an argument for the existence of God. He says when you walk around the beach and you stumble on a grain of sand or a rock or something like that, you're not surprised, right? I mean, you don't think that that requires any explanation. Those are the kinds of things that will just naturally happen. But if you stumble across a pocket watch, which was like a fancy high-tech thing at the time, you would say, clearly this has been designed. And the reason for saying that is all of the pieces of the pocket watch have a purpose. They work together. It's as if they've been arranged for reasons rather than simply randomly. And that makes perfect sense because you know that the pocket watch was in fact designed. It was built by human beings. But then Paley says we have another example of very intricate structures which seem to be designed where the different subparts of the thing have reasons for existing and working together, namely us or other animals or other living beings. So this was pre-Darwin, of course, and he said, how can you possibly account for the exquisite design of biological organisms unless they were put together for a purpose by a higher power which he identified as God? What is the effect of increasing entropy? This idea that there's this tension between the organization of things in the universe and the natural evolution of things became a little bit sharper over the course of the 1800s because that's when we put together this idea that entropy increases all the time. Entropy is a way of talking about the disorderliness, the disorganization, right, the randomness of a certain physical system. Originally, the very first time that entropy was introduced into physics, it was more about dissipated heat because they were trying to build better steam engines. Later in the 1800s, they realized that if you understand atoms and the fundamental constituents of the things around us, you can quantify what we mean by entropy. It's the number of ways you can rearrange the constituents of a system so that it looks the same macroscopically. And then you understand why entropy tends to go up. Things tend to go from orderly to disorderly just because there are many more ways to be disorderly. This is the second law of thermodynamics. This is a deep down law of nature. And it seems to have the consequence, the implication that what happens over time is that the universe becomes more disorderly. And if you just extrapolate that, if you say the universe is a closed system, which we think it is, so the entropy of the universe increases. What does this mean? What does this imply? It implies what we call the heat depth of the universe, that all the stuff you see, the engines, the burning stars, the living beings, these all represent systems that are increasing the overall entropy of the universe. And if you think, which is probably true, that there's a maximum entropy you can reach, a maximum level of disorderliness and chaos, then eventually we will get there and all the interestingness in the universe will be gone. The universe will reach what we call an equilibrium, a state of maximum chaos and nothing interesting happening anymore. What is the difference between entropy and complexity? One of the issues with really feeling through the implications of the second law of thermodynamics is that people tend to mix up simple versus complex and orderly versus disorderly. The truth is these are two different axes, two different ways of thinking about something. The increase of entropy says that we go from orderly to disorderly, but it says nothing about simple versus complex. Or maybe let's put it this way, what it says about simple versus complex is more complex than you might think. When you're very, very low entropy, when you're as orderly as you can be, things will tend to be simple. Think about all the molecules of air in a box are all in one tiny little corner. That's a very unlikely, very low entropy. And that's because you're not going to unlikely very low entropy configuration. It's also very simple because they're all pressed up against each other in the corner. Likewise, a high entropy configuration tends to be simple once again. There are many ways for the individual atoms to be organized so that they're spread evenly throughout the room, but it's still very simple. They're all very evenly spread throughout the room. In order for complexity to arise at all, it seemingly insists that we have a medium entropy configuration. You're balancing enough room for the different atoms and molecules to arrange themselves in interesting ways without just being equally spread throughout the whole system. Now this raises a complicated, sophisticated and quantitative question. If you go from simple and low entropy to simple and high entropy, and in between you could be complex, will you be complex? The answer is maybe some of the time. It depends on the details. Think about cream mixing into coffee. If you stir cream into coffee, you can get a complex fractal pattern along the way, right? Swirls, things that look like galaxies in the cream mixing into the coffee. But you can also just put the cream very gently on top of the coffee and it will dissolve smoothly and uniformly until it's all mixed together. So this is a new scientific question that we are facing right now. What is the journey from low entropy to high entropy like? And how is it affected by the laws of physics so that the actual path it takes leads to complex structures? So we can exist as exquisitely organized human beings as part of the journey from the universe, from low entropy to high entropy. But why we exist? Was it likely? Was it inevitable? Was it very, very lucky? That's something we don't know yet. What is emergence? One of the great features of the world that really helps us understand it and grasp it is that the world appears to us in layers. What I mean by that is you can sort of look at the world and perceive it at different levels of focus. You know, we human beings, we walk through the world and you say, what is the world made of? Well, there's people, there's chairs and tables, and there's plants and animals and the floor and the building and whatever. There's a set of objects that exist in the world. And then if you ask a scientist, a particle physicist, what is the world made of? They might say, oh, the world is made of elementary particles. It's made of electrons and protons and neutrons and forces acting on them. So who is right? Are there people and animals and plants in the world? Or is the world really made of electrons and protons and neutrons? Did realizing that there were atoms and particles in the world make us wrong about the existence of people and animals and plants? No, it did not. They're both true at the same time. And this is a kind of puzzling feature of reality because when we talk about the world, the level of human beings, of objects in our macroscopic world, we're clearly not giving the whole story. We're not giving the details of every single atom and molecule that make up this stuff. We have incomplete information about the world. When you look at a box of gas or a cup of liquid, you don't know the positions and velocities of every atom inside. But the good news is you don't need to either. You still know that if you put an ice cube in a glass of warm water, the ice cube will melt. You can make that prediction reliably even with vastly incomplete information. And this is what we call the phenomenon of emergence, the idea that there's more than one way of talking about how the universe works. There's a way that might be the most fundamental. Maybe that has to do with atoms and particles and quantum mechanics. But then there's higher level ways, emergent levels in the macroscopic reality that we perceive every day that still tell us something true and useful about the world, even though our information about it is radically incomplete. Why is physics such a difficult field to study? You know, I always tell my students that physics or astronomy, these are the right sciences to go into if you have a short attention span. And the reason why is because physics really makes progress by simplifying the world, right? I mean, maybe all the way down to elementary particles. But even when we think about the universe as a whole, the modern cosmologists simplifies the universe enormously. They don't think about every individual galaxy or star. They would never get off the ground, right? You just say, well, maybe the universe is more or less uniform everywhere. That's an incredible dramatic simplification. The good news is it works. You can get very, very far by making that simplification, thinking about what it means, and then putting in the complications later. This is a legacy that we were handed by Galileo, of all people. You know, Galileo knew, he read in Aristotle, that if you had two objects, a heavy one and a light one, and you let them go, the heavier one falls down faster. And guess what? That's true. If you actually do it, that will be what happens. Galileo says, yeah, but that's because of air resistance. If you imagine ignoring air resistance, a book and a feather will fall down at exactly the same rate. He couldn't do that. Galileo couldn't actually do an experiment to ignore air resistance. We need to fly to the moon and drop two things. And then you actually see the experiment is right. The Apollo astronauts verified that Galileo was right. But the method of ignoring the complication and putting it in later, that works for whole wide swaths of physics. And that's why physics is able to make such enormous progress. When it comes to biology, when it comes to sociology or psychology, when it comes to the emergence of higher levels out of the simple microscopic world, that methodology doesn't always work anymore. If you say, imagine a person and forget about all their interactions with other people. Well, you know, okay, you can try to do that. But it turns out that those interactions with other people are actually crucially important. When it comes to the macroscopic world around us, the world that we see every day, the complications really matter. But we know that it has to be compatible somehow with the simplicity of the microscopic world. So you can tell those two stories independently. You can just be a psychologist or be a biologist, and that's fine. Or you could be a physicist, and that's also fine. What I'm interested in is reconciling the different layers of reality, explaining how they can be consistent with each other. It's one thing to say you have biological evolution, and that leads to the complicated ecosystem with different kinds of species and different niches. How about why is that compatible with the laws of physics? How does that arise out of the evolution of the universe? It clearly must be. And in somehow tying them together, maybe we will learn something interesting about both. Is life a struggle against entropy? A lot of times you'll hear people talk about life as a struggle against increasing entropy. That's crazy. That's like saying my life is a struggle against eating food. I think that eating food is really important. In fact, it literally is a transfer of low entropy into high entropy. Think about my favorite example is the sun. What does the sun do for us here on Earth? And if you ask people, what good is the sun for biology and the ecosystem here on Earth, we get energy from the sun in the form of sunlight. It's true, but it's not the whole story. It's not even the important part of the story. The important part is we get sunlight, and most of it is in the visible wavelengths of light. So we get a certain set of photons with certain energies, and then we absorb them. And what do we do? We convert them into higher entropy forms of energy. The Earth radiates into space more or less exactly the same amount of energy as it gets from the sun, but it radiates it in a much higher entropy form. For every one photon of energy we get from the sun, we radiate 20 photons of light back into the universe with on average one twentieth of the energy each. But the total has 20 times the entropy. What happened? We got fuel from the sun. We got usable energy, and then we degraded it. We turned it into a higher entropy form. And we need to do that. This is called metabolism. This is called maintaining our lives. All of that low entropy energy we get from the sun is captured by animals and plants. It's used to make sugars and other fuels. It's what keeps us going. The way to think about it is we are riding a wave from low entropy to high entropy. And you shouldn't just because the wave will eventually crash upon the shore, you shouldn't say, ah, we're fighting against the wave. No, no, no. We're riding the wave. That is what lets us exist. That is what gives us the ability to think about the past to affect the future. All the things that we think of as part of being a living being are possible because we live in a world of increasing entropy. What are the origins of life here on earth? One of the difficulties in figuring out specifically how life here on earth came into being is that it's not just a random sort of complex system. It's a very specific thing. And life as we know it now involves different aspects, all of which are important. You need replication, right? We need Darwinian evolution. We have DNA. We have a genome that gets replicated, not perfectly, but pretty well. You need compartmentalization. Every cell has a cell wall so you can separate the living cell from the rest of the world. And also you need metabolism, right? You need that fuel. You need that low entropy energy that we can use to keep ourselves going and then expel to the world in a higher entropy form. So which came first? This is why explaining the beginning of complex structures is always hard because they all seem to depend on each other. There is a replication first camp in the origin of life studies literature that says, look, clearly the genetic information is necessary to call it life. That must have come first. And it must have hooked up to an energy source. But there's also a metabolism first camp that says, look, it doesn't matter if you have information sitting there. If it's not going someplace, if it's not doing anything, if it's not moving around and metabolizing, you can't call it life. And the nice thing to me about the metabolism first point of view is that you can kind of see how it might arise out of purely physical, non-biological processes. Because remember, to maintain its orderliness and its complexity, living beings need to increase the entropy of the universe. They need to feed off of low entropy energy. And that's a very standard thing outside the realm of life. When you strike a match and light something on fire, you're increasing the entropy of the universe. The thing is that that's pretty easy. The Tinder that you had or the crumpled newspapers, they were ready to light up. Sometimes you have a chemical configuration where it could go to a higher entropy configuration, but there's no direct route to get there. So maybe it'll just sit there. Maybe it will never increase in entropy. But maybe under the right circumstances, there's a sequence of chemical reactions with the right circumstances, the right environments, the right catalysts and enzymes to make it all happen. And maybe that chain of interactions and chemical processes is the beginning of life. So this was an idea that a number of biologists and geologists had. And on the basis of it, they made predictions. They said, you know, life is not going to form in some warm pond. This is Darwin's idea that maybe you just put all the stuff together, all the ingredients, and eventually a little bug crawls out, okay, or a little bacterium. And they said, look, that's never going to happen because there's no increasing entropy there. What you need is just the right biochemical geological arrangement of things to have these long, sophisticated, complex reactions happen that can then be captured into the first living organism. And they thought about what kind of conditions would they be. And they thought that it might be a warm hydrothermal vent under the oceans, right, with certain chemical balances. And I'm a physicist. I don't know the details, and I shouldn't say anything. But the point is, these kinds of hydrothermal vents were not known at the time. They had not yet been discovered. But a prediction was made. These must exist in order for life to have come into existence. And after the prediction was made, we found them. Famously, the lost city formation at the bottom of the Atlantic Ocean was found by submersibles going down near the bottom of the ocean floor. We found exactly the kind of geochemical conditions that have been hypothesized as possible places where life could have formed. Does that mean it's right? No, but it's a little bit of evidence that it could be on the right track. The origin of life, I think, personally, is one of the most important unanswered scientific questions. But it's one that we're absolutely making progress on right now. How many things had to go right for us to exist? The thing about life coming into existence is it required a lot of things to go right, but it was less unlikely than you might think. A lot of times people try to like run numbers and give you some scary looking calculation that seems to be indicating that it was wildly unlikely for life ever to come into existence. And of course, that depends on the assumptions that you're making. A lot of time what they're really doing is thinking, well, if you just have random configurations, if you have a random number generator, how likely would it be that you would print out Shakespeare or something like that, right? A random letter generator. And it's very, very unlikely, although it happened if you waited long enough. The nice thing is, in the real world, we didn't have a random number generator. We started with a very, very orderly configuration. That's what was given to us by the low entropy of the Big Bang. So it's a different question you should be asking. It's not in all the possible arrangements of stuff, which of them would have looked like life. It's in all the different paths you could take from the low entropy beginning of the universe to the high entropy future, which of them would pass through something as complicated as a living being. I don't know how to do that calculation either, but I know that it's much more likely to get complex structures that way than just to have a random number generator spitting things out. Of course, there's a whole other question, which is what kind of processes are allowed in the universe? What processes do the laws of physics let you imagine? Why do we have atoms and molecules at all? We seem to live in a universe where the very delicate laws of physics that give you the mass of the electron and the proton and the neutron and the strength of all the forces that let them interact are such that they allow for the existence of complex structures. Is that easy? Is that surprising? Is that something that requires an explanation? I think that naively, as of right now, it does seem to require an explanation, and we don't have one. The idea of a multiverse is a very plausible explanation. Like maybe in some universes, these complex structures can come into existence. In some, they can't. Of course, if that's true, we will only ever find ourselves in the places where we can find ourselves. That's not a great discovery. But if there aren't other universes out there, how likely is it that something like us would have come into existence? I don't know. I think it's a great question for scientists and philosophers to be thinking about. If this isn't God's design we're seeing, what is it? William Paley wasn't crazy when he said, you know, I look at the complexity and the arrangement, the sophistication of a living being, and I attribute it to a designer, okay, which he had then identified as God. It makes sense. It's a paradigm that we know how it works. People really do build pocket watches. Maybe God built human beings. To me, the history of science is a series of discoveries that make these seemingly inexplicable things make a lot more sense. Now that we know there's genetic information, it mutates, we can explain by a natural selection the existence of all these different biological species. That part has been explained. We have the next bigger picture question about why the universe allows for these kinds of processes. We don't know the answer to that yet, but my feeling is it will be explained. Furthermore, I think that's cheating a little bit what Paley did. I think it's worth sort of being good scientists about this because we're very often faced with a puzzling circumstance in our lives as well as in science, right? And we say, well, why is this this way? And we come up with different explanations. And the way that we think about it is, well, it would this would be the case if this theory of the world had been correct. But that's not the final story. That's not the end of how you should be thinking about this. If you have two different theories of the world, God exists and God doesn't exist, for example, you have to think about all of the predictions that would follow from that. Do we live in the kind of cosmos that we would expect to live in if God had created it versus do we live in the kind of cosmos that we'd expect to live in if it were just the laws of physics chugging away? You know, the people thousands of years ago who first started thinking about this stuff, they did think that there was a divine watchmaker. They didn't have watches, but you know what I mean, world maker. And they also put themselves here on Earth more or less at the center of that cosmos because we human beings had an important role to play. We know better now. We live on a planet surrounding a star, which is one of several hundred billion stars in our galaxy. And there are hundreds of billions of galaxies in the observable universe. We human beings are not that important. There's a lot more stuff out there in the universe than you would imagine if you thought that we had been part of the reason why the universe came into existence. So to me, there's a lot more that fits well, that fits nicely, that is explicable in a universe that just obeys the laws of physics, even if we don't know the answer to all the questions. Of course, saying that undoes some of the nice things that had been done by God's existence, like giving us a purpose, a meaning to our existence because God tells us what the purpose is. I am also someone who takes very seriously the fact that was emphasized by Friedrich Nietzsche and many other people, that when you take God out of the story, we have a lot of work to do to decide is there a purpose to our lives? How should we lead them? If there's not a reason for our existence given to us from the outside, is it possible for us to create that purpose? I think the answer is yes. In fact, I think that's what we do all the time. Since we human beings invented God, that was just a roundabout way of giving ourselves purpose. I think we're still now doing the same thing that human beings have always done. We're doing it in a slightly more open-eyed way, in a way that is much more compatible with the fundamental nature of reality. What is Laplace's demon and do we have human agency? You know, after Isaac Newton invented the rules of classical physics, it wasn't for quite a while until Pierre-Simon Laplace around the year 1800. He really understood the implications of what Newton had done. He really noticed that this is the clockwork deterministic universe. And the way that he emphasized this to make it vivid was a thought experiment. He said, if you're going to imagine ourselves in the universe, these zeros would actually form an algebraic law. He said, imagine a vast intellect, an intellect that was so vast, so good, that it could perceive the location and the motion of every single thing in the universe, every atom as we would now say. But every particle, every photon, every bit of the universe and this vast intellect was so smart that it could actually solve the laws of physics from that starting point. And it would project it into the future. Laplace realized that that same vast intellect could also retrodict what happened to the past, the information about what is happening at any one moment in time in the universe. If you are this vast intellect, which subsequent generations dubbed Laplace's demon, if you knew all that, the future, the present, and the past are equally visible to you because the fundamental classical laws of physics are deterministic and tell you exactly what's going to happen. Ever since then, people have worried about this. They're thinking, you know, well if everything is determined then I don't have any free will. What can I do? How can I get through the day? The answer is you are not Laplace's demon. Laplace knew perfectly well that we're not going to come close to being Laplace's demon. If you take the amount of information in a grain of sand, you would need, I forget the exact number, but it's something like a million billion laptop computers to contain the information contained in the atoms and the molecules in that grain of sand. It's never going to happen and those computers wouldn't have the computing power to predict what would happen next anyway. We human beings are finite. We are computationally limited and bounded, but the good news is that's okay. We can still get through the day. We can still throw a baseball and catch it. We have the ability to have vastly incomplete information about the universe and yet do a pretty good, although not perfect, job of predicting what will happen next. So thought experiments about what life would be like if we were Laplace's demon are fun to do but irrelevant to human life. The question of what human beings can do is a very different one and there are interesting, subtle, complicated, sophisticated answers to that that lie at the intersection of psychology, neuroscience, computation theory, information theory, and physics. You have to keep emphasizing the difference between the real life of a human being and the imaginary life of all the particles in the universe obeying the laws of physics. If we were Laplace's demon, if we did have the computational and informational capacity to predict everything that would happen, it would be hard to imagine that life would have meaning because you know everything is going to happen. There's no choices that are going to be involved. But the real world isn't that. None of us is like that and in fact not only do we have incomplete information about the world but it's very hard to think about how we interact with the world given that when we do the world interacts back on us and then we think about it we interact back on the world. There's a feedback cycle here. There's a give and take between us and the world. So given that we have incomplete information and given that we're embedded in the world and that we have an effect on it, the right way to conceptualize things is that we are agents. We are not collections of atoms and molecules. We are but that's not the right way to think about it if you're a human being trying to make sense of the world. We are agents that can make decisions and our decisions have an impact on the world and it goes back to this idea of the space of all possible worlds, the space of all possible things that can happen. We human beings in a way that might be unique, this is unclear among people who are studying other species, we have an ability to reason counterfactually to think not about just what will happen but of various things that could happen and then pick the one that we think is a good one. And since we don't know the positions and velocities of every molecule in the universe we can't say what would happen just given the laws of physics. What we have to say is given the choices I make what is the future that I'm going to help bring about? So like it or not the world that we really know and live in is one where our choices matter. That's where meaning comes from, from recognizing that in the real world of the knowledge that we have and our computational boundedness we have some responsibility for bringing about what is going to happen next. What are the different viewpoints on free will? You know I have a personal view that discussions of free will are some of the most boring discussions that there can be at the intersection of philosophy and human life. It's not because the topic is boring but it's because people very quickly start arguing about the definitions of words. What do you mean by free will? So I've often made this suggestion to people who want to talk to me about free will that I'm happy to do it as long as we don't use the phrase free will. As long as we actually say what we mean we can make more progress. No one ever agrees with that suggestion that I make because they like talking about free will even though they don't agree on the definition. So there are two big idea definitions that are a little bit different from each other and it's worth distinguishing. There's what we call libertarian free will and libertarian free will is that somehow I am not beholden to the laws of nature. I as a human being I am a law unto myself. Manuel Kant and other people put it in these terms. They said there's no way of thinking of a human being as somehow a collection of physical things obeying the laws of physics. There's something that is inescapably human that cannot be reduced to an understanding of ourselves as just mindless pieces conglomerated together to make something with a mind. So libertarian free will is truly an ability to make choices and do things in the world that cannot even in principle in any way be explained by stuff obeying the laws of physics. Now I would say no modern scientist believes in that. To say no is an exaggeration. There's probably some who do but the overwhelming majority of scientists take seriously the idea that we know what we are physically. We are collections of atoms, molecules, etc. that in principle obey the laws of physics. In practice we don't have the information to predict what a human being will do but in principle it's there. So libertarian free will is something you can imagine. There are people who believe in it but it's not sort of the locus of discussion in the modern world so much anymore. The question is if you not believe her in libertarian free will is there anything left? And so this is where we enter into the idea of compatibilist free will because there's a set of people who say look I'm just a collection of atoms and molecules I obey the laws of physics and therefore there is no free will. Therefore there's no sense in thinking of myself as an agent making decisions, having responsibility for anything, anything like that. And there's another school of thought that comes in and says wait a minute surely you can't be serious. You can't be telling me that just because I'm made of atoms and molecules obeying the laws of physics that I can't talk about myself as a person making choices. In fact, and I'm in this camp so I'm not gonna be fair I'm gonna try to be correct but I'm not gonna be completely unbiased when I compare the different points of view. Compatibilism says that we can still talk about human beings as agents making choices while also agreeing that we don't violate the laws of physics. And to say well how are those two things compatible that's perfectly fair question and the answer is emergence. The answer is layers of reality. The answer is there are different ways of talking about the world that are compatible with each other but very very different. And in fact I would say that every person who denies the existence of free will still goes through their life trying to convince other people to act in certain ways, puzzling over choices they could make etc. The compatibilist just takes those things seriously and says therefore I should talk about people as agents making choices. And then the thing is and we call that free will and people say well you shouldn't call that free will you're redefining it. There I truly don't care if you don't want to call that free will be my guest. What all I care about is I am allowed to talk about human beings as agents making choices and responsible for their actions in exactly that way. It's very often in the conversations about free will you find people who believe in free will contrasted with determinists who just think the laws of physics are gonna tell us what happens in the world. To me this is one of the biggest mistakes we can make. Not that you should be determinist or not but that there is some relationship between determinism versus non-determinism and free will versus non-free will. Those are two separate questions. Determinism is a statement about how the laws of physics work. It goes back to Pierre-Simon Laplace explicating the implications of classical mechanics a la Isaac Newton. He says if you knew the position and velocity of everything in the world the equations of classical physics deterministically predict what will happen next. There's no randomness. There's no nothing that is unknown or probabilistic or stochastic. You know exactly what's going to happen in the future. Quantum mechanics comes along in the 1920s and says but the world doesn't work that way. The world of our observation, the world in which we live, you can't predict exactly what will happen. The laws of physics are not up to the task. Now there are subtleties. If you're a many worlds person like I am the multiverse is deterministic but still in our world the evolution is clearly not deterministic. Okay that's just how the laws of physics actually are. None of that has anything to do with free will. Quantum mechanics allows for non-deterministic laws in the sense that it says from this initial condition you can't predict what you will observe next. You can only predict the probabilities. So what as far as free will is concerned? It's not that my volition brings the electron into spinning clockwise or spinning counterclockwise. The laws of physics still do that. If what you are worried about is free will versus the laws of physics it doesn't matter at all whether those laws are deterministic or indeterministic. What matters is are there laws? That's what matters. If we're beings that obey the laws of physics if those laws of physics are a little bit stochastic that doesn't give us any more free will than we had before. And in fact the laws of physics are a little bit stochastic so that's the world that you should try to explain. But the compatibilist position is not one that denies determinism or indeterminism. It doesn't care. What it's saying is that you can both be a law-abiding thing in the universe, a physical system subject to the laws of nature, and it makes sense to talk about you as an agent making choices because you're talking about a different level of description, a higher level emerging kind of phenomenon. So I really think that once I start talking to someone about compatibilist free will and they start talking about determinism I know they've missed the point. How do our feelings fit into the molecular world? There's a way that we have of thinking about human beings that works at the human being level, right? I have not only an idea of who I am but I have an idea of who you are. I have idea of what other people are like, what they're thinking. I have a theory of the mental state and the emotional states of other human beings. This is part of how I describe the world. And where you get into a little bit of trouble or at least a little bit of tension with the underlying laws of physics is you say okay I'm describing myself in terms of you know I have some knowledge but I also have some preferences. I have some desires. I have some values. I have some feelings. I have some emotions and you're telling me that I'm also a collection of neurons, right? Or cells and they obey certain principles of biology and then you're telling me that those cells and those neurons are made of atoms and particles and they obey the laws of physics. And once I get to the level of neurons much less the level of atoms and molecules there's no feelings there. There's no desires. There's no emotions. There's not even any sort of memories or anything like that. So how can I say that I really have emotions or feelings in desires if I also think that I'm a collection of neurons or a collection of cells or a collection of atoms and molecules? And I think that that whole discussion is just a category mistake. You're mixing vocabularies. The whole idea of a multi-layered emerging universe is there are different ways of talking about reality and they're all equally valid or at least they're all valid in their own regimes but they're separately valid. So when I open the closet door in the morning and say should I wear the blue shirt or the red shirt it doesn't help me to say well I'm gonna do whatever my atoms want me to do. My atoms have no wants. There is something that I have that is a want and the fact that I made of atoms doesn't make that go away. I'm sitting on a chair 200 years ago I would have said the chair is made of wood. Today I can say it's made of atoms and molecules. Does that mean it's not made of wood anymore? No it's still also made of wood. That's just a different way of talking about it. So when you attribute desires, wants, feelings, choices to people at the level of people that's a hundred percent valid and it is compatible with describing them as collections of atoms where there are no feelings, wants, desires, or choices. Are there objections to the compatibilist worldview? I think that the best objection to my own view about free will, the compatibilist view, the emergent view, is that it's a little loosey-goosey in some sense right? I'm saying I can talk about human beings, a level of human beings, or I could talk about atoms and so forth. Well where do I draw the line? I mean really what the compatibilist needs to be able to say is our best way of talking about human beings given the information we actually have about human beings. So not given the information about all their atoms or neurons but the actual information we see talking to them, discussing things with them, is as agents making decisions. So the non-compatibilist could say well what if someday we have a better theory? What if someday I'm able to read your micro expressions on your face and exactly and reliably predict what you will do next? Would you still have free will? And my answer is maybe not. My answer is I can imagine in principle getting so good at predicting how human beings actually behave on the basis of truly accessible information that the concept of free will no longer becomes helpful or necessary. That's just an improvement in our scientific understanding. Do I think that actually will ever happen? No. For lots of good reasons. Human beings are incredibly complex. There's chaotic dynamics. There's quantum fluctuations. There's a whole bunch of reasons why we can improve our picture of human beings without giving up. Why we should expect to never give up on the picture of human beings as agents making decisions. Still we're pushed in this direction by the fact that we can build artificial attempts at trying to be a human being, trying to be an intelligent agent, trying to be something conscious. We can write a computer program that mimics human behavior. And AI has become really really good at mimicking human behavior. It has not become conscious. When you try to show that the AI is just mimicking and not truly understanding the world, it's not that hard. All of the modern AI programs are very easy to see. They don't truly have understanding of the world. But how long will that last? I don't know. Could we be approaching a threshold, a change where we truly have artificial programs that for all intents and purposes we can't do any better to talk about them than we do about human beings as agents with desires making choices? I honestly don't know. I think that's fascinating. I think that there is a big noticeable gap between a human being making choices and a collection of atoms where I predict what they will do next. But nowadays we're exploring the space of possibilities in between those different extremes. And that will hopefully help us think about it more clearly and maybe we'll get a better vocabulary for discussing not only human beings but artificial intelligences as well. I do think that the existence of computers and the ubiquity of computers everywhere has sort of tainted our way of thinking about thinking, about thinking about what it means to be a thinking thing because computers think in some sense, right? I mean they add numbers together just like we do but they're way better at it. Like the simplest, in the old days we would have you know wristwatches with calculators on them and they're much better at multiplying numbers together than the best human being is. But they're dumber at everything else. And this sort of distorts how we think what it means to be intelligent. You know Go and Chess are two of the games that human beings invented and we hold them up as pinnacles of intelligent thought. And now computers are way better at those games than we are and we kind of feel bad about it. But the truth is those games are tailor-made to be things that computers can be good at. They're finite, there's a rigid set of possible rules, there's only a discrete number of possibilities, it's a very big number of possibilities. But you can brute force your way into figuring out what to do and human beings don't think in the same way. A human Grandmaster at chess does not think about the chessboard in the same way that an AI does. A Grandmaster will think about big configurations in a holistic way. If you suddenly told a chess Grandmaster we're gonna play chess except that every other move the rook will move diagonally instead of horizontally and vertically. The chess master would you know think about it and probably make some elementary mistakes but still be able to play a pretty good game. A computer would have no clue what to do. All it's done is run simulations with the actual rules. If you change the rules to something else it doesn't know what to do. And that doesn't make the computers better or worse than human beings. It's a different way of thinking. We human beings through our biology are not trained to add numbers together or play chess but we're trained to get a picture of the world very quickly and react to it in this kind of holistic way with vastly incomplete sets of information compared to a perfect reasoner or perfect observer of the world. The miracle of the world is that the incomplete information we can get about it still gives us a handle on what's going on, how to react to it. We can predict the future a little bit. We can predict the tides very accurately. The weather not quite so much. The stock market not very well at all. But those different levels of accuracy are important. It gives us the impression which is correct at the level of human beings that we can affect the world in which we live. That because we do this thing rather than that thing we don't know which one we're gonna do but if we did something the consequences would be different. We can put it in the following way because a lot of people who are anti free will the way they phrase it is I will believe that there's free will if there's a way that I could have acted differently and what they have in mind is they are collections of particles or you know whatever physical system that is obeying the laws of physics and in fact they could not have acted differently because the laws of physics are the laws of physics. But the reality is you could have acted differently depending on what given what information given the actual information you know about yourself you could have acted differently because the information you have about yourself it's wildly incomplete. It's compatible with all sorts of different microscopic arrangements of what's going on in your brain and your body. That incomplete information is why we're not perfect reasoners about the future. Why we have decisions to make and why those decisions have consequences because that's the world in which we live. We are not microscopic we're real world that matters we should take that seriously because we can we can do things we can talk about what the consequences are and we can attach rightness or wrongness to them. That's what makes it all in the end of the day matter.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 16288\n","\n","Link  93 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/Fcx3WEhodBw\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fcx3WEhodBw\n","[youtube] Fcx3WEhodBw: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] Fcx3WEhodBw: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 9.69MiB in 02:02\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  People are worried about their memory. If you're forgetting to show up for your four o'clock meeting, or you forgot the actor who played Tony Soprano in the HBO series The Sopranos. Can't remember that guy's name. What is it? A lot of us tend to blame ourselves. This absent mindedness is a sign of mental weakness or a failing memory or a lack of character. But 99% of forgetting that happens to all of us is normal. So there are things that we can do to be less afraid, less panicked, have a better relationship with our memory today. Because forgetting is a normal part of being human. My name is Lisa Genova. I am an author and neuroscientist. The name of my book is Remember, The Science of Memory and the Art of Forgetting. So how do we reinforce our memories? How do we make our memories stronger, resilient to time, so that we can recall them decades later? The first essential ingredient in creating a memory that's going to last longer than this present moment is attention. If I put my glasses down and don't give it a moment's attention to notice where I've put this, I can't remember where they are because I never formed that memory to begin with. Your brain will never remember what you don't pay attention to. Chronic stress is really bad for our memory. Stress hormones mobilize your brain and body to respond, to fight, to flee, to react quickly, not to think. Stress is meant to be an acute, quick, on-and-off phenomenon. So what happens in your brain and body if you're exposed to chronic, unrelenting stress? And how does that affect your memory? Under chronic stress, your body will just keep dumping adrenaline and cortisol and it can't shut off. This is bad for memory. You are actually shrinking your hippocampus. The part of your brain that's essential for forming consciously held memories is going to be smaller. You'll be inhibiting neurogenesis, the birth of new neurons. The very good news about all of this, because I probably just scared everyone, is that there are things that we can do to combat stress. This is where things like yoga, meditation, mindfulness, and exercise come into play. All of these have been shown to restore the size of people's hippocampus who have been chronically stressed. A quick word on meditation. A lot of people are intimidated by meditation. They sort of know that this is probably good for them in lots of ways, but maybe don't know how to do it. Here's a nine-second meditation to help restore your cortisol levels and to help save your hippocampus and your ability to remember. Close your eyes if you can. Breathe in through your nose to the count of four. Hold it for a second and then breathe out through your nose to the count of four. And notice how you feel. Here's what's going on. The stress response causes you to breathe like this. By breathing slowly in and out through your nose, you are telling your brain and body that you are safe. We also want to get enough sleep. Sleep is not a state of doing nothing where you're unconscious and it's a waste of time. You're very biologically busy while you sleep. And there are a number of super important things that are going on in your brain with respect to memory. For example, if I got a horrible night's sleep last night, I'm going to wake up today and my frontal lobe is going to have a hard time dragging itself to its day job. And one of its most important jobs is paying attention. And if I can't pay attention to what's going on today, what am I not going to be able to do well today? Form new memories. Also, your hippocampus consolidates the information you're learning into a lasting memory that you can consciously retrieve while you sleep. So what happens if you don't get enough sleep? Your hippocampus might not have had enough time to do the job. And so your memories from what happened yesterday and the stuff you learned yesterday might not be fully formed today, or they might not be formed at all. Caffeine is actually good for memory because caffeine increases your attention. So anything that's an attention booster is going to be a memory booster. We know that sleep is super important for forming memories. So caffeine is good for memory. You just want to be careful that it's not compromising your sleep. Our brains are not designed to remember people's names. These are abstract concepts. They live in neurological cul-de-sacs. Ultimately, there's only one way into that house that lives at the end of that street. There's no other way to get there. So can we supply more associations to the person's name to give us a chance? In psychology, this is called the Baker-Baker paradox. If I'm trying to remember your name and your name is Mr. Baker, that's really tough for me to remember. Abstract concept. But if I were asked to remember the word Baker, I can picture him wearing an apron and he's got flour on his face. And, oh, I remember the bakery I used to love as a kid. We used to get danishes there on Sundays. So now I've got all of these associations in my brain attaching to that word Baker and gives me a chance to hook into it. For all of these memories, they benefit from repetition. The more we repeat, the more we practice, the more we rehearse a memory, we are strengthening those neural connections, making that neural circuit stronger and more likely to be fully retrieved. One of the ways that we can repeat a memory is by writing it down. If I've experienced a certain number of things today and I keep a journal, what I've chosen to write down will become a stronger, more reinforced memory in my brain. I will also have the opportunity to revisit that memory by reading it later. So many people come up to me so worried, saying, if I don't write what I need to do, later down, I'm going to forget to do it. That's got to mean I'm getting Alzheimer's. And I tell all of them, no, it's your perspective memory. It's terrible. It's not cheating to write it down. It's actually good practice. Airline pilots do not rely on their brains and their perspective memories to remember to lower the wheels before landing the plane. They outsource the job to a to-do list, a checklist. We should all write it down. Put it in your phones, put it in your calendar alerts, make to-do lists. If you want to remember to pick up milk at the grocery store, write it down. Another way to better remember this information has to do with self-testing. If I'm trying to consolidate something into memory and I'm only putting the information in my head, I'm traveling one way on the neurons. If I then try to recall the information, I'm pulling the information out. Now I'm going the other way. Going over those circuits in both directions will help reinforce and make that memory stronger. Okay. Having a word stuck on the tip of your tongue is a normal glitch in memory retrieval. It's just a normal glitch in memory retrieval. It's just a byproduct of how our brains are organized. So looking up a word, Googling a word that's on the tip of your tongue isn't cheating. It will not cause digital amnesia. It will not make your memory weaker in any way. It frees you up. We can Google anything that we can't remember in a moment's notice and then use that information to continue thinking, to continue the conversation, to learn more. You have my permission to Google it and look it up. What I would love for you to take away from all of this is that your memory is amazing. It is limitless in what it's capable of remembering if you supply it with the right kind of information, if you supply it with the right kind of tools and associations. And it's wildly imperfect. And that's just the price of owning a human brain. Forgetting is a normal part of being human.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1401\n","\n","Link  94 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/Ywec1MbeQDk\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ywec1MbeQDk\n","[youtube] Ywec1MbeQDk: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] Ywec1MbeQDk: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 5.96MiB in 00:00\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Habits kind of got a bad name in psychology. We're all focused on how creative and how amazing and how wonderful human minds are. Because your dogs learn through habits, they were viewed as too limited to apply to human performance. And it's not how we think about our behavior, right? Habits don't involve much conscious thought. Your dog doesn't have much conscious thought. I know it seems like they do, but they don't. But people are pretty simple as well. In research, we're able to show that people act on habits much more than we're aware of. My name's Wendy Wood, and I'm a behavioral scientist. I do research on habits and why they're so difficult to change. Back in the 1980s, some researchers wanted to convince people in a four-story office building to start using the stairs. So they started just the way all of us would. They started trying to convince people. They put up signs. It's good to take the stairs. It's good for your health. It's bad to take the elevator. Waste energy. But the signs had no effect. So these very creative researchers decided, okay, let's try something different. They slowed the closing of the elevator door by 16 seconds. And that was enough to dissuade people. They reduced the elevator use by a third. And the wonderful thing about the study is when they put the elevator door back to its original speed, people kept taking the stairs because they had formed a habit to take the stairs and they just stuck with it. And it's an example of what psychologists have called friction, barriers to performing a behavior. Distance, time, and effort are all friction. Friction is really important in determining what behaviors we repeat and so what behaviors become a habit. We think we go to the gym because we're concerned about fitness. We're determined. We exert willpower. So it feels like that's a good way to start to change our habits, right? We exert self-control and our habits will then change. But it doesn't work that way. Our habits are stored in a memory system that we don't have access to. We can't fuss with. It's a way of securing the most important information and protecting it from change. And so there's no way you can change that habit memory except through repetition of other behaviors. We repeat a behavior in a given context in the same way and we get some reward. When we get a reward, our brain releases dopamine. Habits get us to repeat behaviors and form habits. One of the really important things about behavior change is you have to work with what's around you. Habits reorganize the way we store information in memory. They form these associations between contexts. General chefs set up their stations before they start making sure they have all of the ingredients, all of the utensils, pots and pans are there. They've read through the recipe. And it's a great metaphor for all of us when we go about changing our behavior. We really need an environment that would make it easier to actually achieve our goals. There's actually evidence that our habits help give us meaning in life. Rituals have a habit component. Some of the rituals we perform really are kind of automatic and habitual. Professional athletes provide some of the best examples of people who effectively use rituals. Baseball players are really well known for this, of having patterns of things they do before they go to bat. And what rituals give high level athletes is a sense of control because they have something they repeat, they do it successfully. So it really does give them a sense of confidence. When we are in environments where we know what to do and we feel comfortable doing them, it allows us to effectively multitask. When we've practiced one thing enough so we don't have to think about it, then we can do other things. We can make sense out of our world.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 673\n","\n","Link  95 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/e-or_D-qNqM\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/e-or_D-qNqM\n","[youtube] e-or_D-qNqM: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] e-or_D-qNqM: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 7.01MiB in 02:56\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  There are only two kinds of people who do not experience painful emotions. The first kind are the psychopaths. The second kind are dead. There is a false understanding or expectation that a happy life means being happy all the time. No, learning to accept and even embrace painful emotions is an important part of a happy life and the study of painful emotions is an important part of the field of happiness studies. My name is Tal Ben-Shahar. I'm a student and teacher in the field of happiness studies and my most recent book is Happier No Matter What. There is a very important concept that was introduced by Nassim Taleb and that is antifragility. Antifragility is essentially resilience 2.0. Resilience 1.0 is when we put pressure on a system after the pressure is lifted, that system goes back to its original form. Antifragility takes this idea a step further. We put pressure on a system, it actually grows bigger, stronger. We see antifragile systems all around us and within us. For example, our muscular system. We go to the gym and we lift weights. We're putting pressure on our muscles. What happens as a result? We actually grow stronger. We're an antifragile system. On the psychological level, you know what that's called? PTG, post-traumatic growth. So we're post-traumatic stress disorder. PTSD is about breaking down. Post-traumatic growth is about growing stronger. As a result of pressure, stress, it's antifragility. The role of the science of happiness is to teach us what conditions we can put in place to increase the likelihood of growing from hardship. Now there is a paradox when it comes to pursuing happiness. On the one hand, we know that happiness is a good thing, whether in and of itself or as a means toward other ends. At the same time, we also know from research by Iris Moss and others, that people who say to themselves, happiness is important for me, I want to pursue it. Those individuals actually end up being less happy. In fact, they're more likely to experience depression. So the paradox is that on the one hand, happiness is clearly a good thing. On the other hand, valuing it as a good thing is problematic. So what do we do? The way to resolve this paradox is that we pursue happiness indirectly. Think about sunlight. So if I look at the sun directly, it's going to hurt my eyes. However, if I break down sunlight into its elements, into its constituents, I can look at the colors of the rainbow. So I'm indirectly looking at the sunlight, enjoying it, savoring it. In the same way, pursuing happiness directly can cause more harm than good, but breaking it down into its elements can lead us to enjoy the indirect pursuit of happiness and by extension, to raise our overall levels of happiness. What are the metaphorical colors of the rainbow when it comes to happiness? Here we have what I've come to call the Spire model, and it can trigger the antifragile system. Spire is an acronym that stands for spiritual, physical, intellectual, relational, and finally, emotional well-being. Spirituality is about finding a sense of meaning and purpose in life, at work and at home. If you wake up in the morning with a purpose, you're more likely to overcome barriers. When it comes to physical well-being, the most important idea to look at is stress, the silent killer. In the United States, more than half of the employees do not use up their vacation time, and even those that do, close to half, are still tethered to their work. The problem is not the stress, it's the lack of recovery. In intellectual well-being, there's research showing that people who are curious, who ask questions are not just happier, they also live longer. Another important element is not just asking questions, it's deeply engaging with material. It can be text, a work of art, even nature. Physical well-being is very important. The number one predictor of happiness is quality time we spend with people we care about and who care about us. And it turns out the number one condition that we can put in place to increase the likelihood of antifragility, of growing through hardship, is the quality of our relationships. Finally, emotional well-being, so embracing painful emotions is critical, but how do we then cultivate pleasurable ones? Specifically the emotion of gratitude. Cicero talked about gratitude as the mother of all virtues. When we appreciate the good in our life, we have more of it. So happiness is much more than pleasure. Happiness is whole being. These five elements together create that sunlight, happiness. I don't think there is a point before which one is unhappy after which one is happy. Rather happiness resides on a continuum. It's a lifelong journey. And knowing that, we can have realistic rather than unrealistic expectations about what is possible. I do not think that things necessarily happen for the best. However, we can learn to make the best of things that happen. Get smarter faster with videos from the world's biggest thinkers.

Too many emails, too many messages, too many things to do, too many things to remember. We are trying to run complex, modern lives, trying to take in and make sense of more information than ever on brains that haven't changed biologically in 200,000 years. Now, as I went about solving that problem over time, I started to realize, oh, this wasn't just a solution to one problem. It was actually this cognitive exoskeleton, this system that people could use to create better work, to make better decisions, to be more productive, to save time. And so it started as the solution to a problem and over time became this entire methodology of how to do creative work in an environment of information overload. The Brain My name is Tiago Forte. I am the founder of Forte Labs and the author of the book, Building a Second Brain. I wrote this book in the first place to solve the problem of information abundance. We can't be the first people to ever have too much information to manage. So I went back through history when society was changing, the economy was changing, the way that we lived was changing. And it turned out throughout history again and again, every time humanity faced too much change and too much information going on around them, they turned to the same solution. They turned to the solution, this thing called a commonplace book, almost like a journal, except it wasn't just a place for them to pour out their personal thoughts and reflections. It was a place for them to keep a much wider variety of things, quotes and Bible verses and recipes and bits of advice and wisdom, a leaf that they found in the garden or later on a photograph. It became this central repository of all the information and content that was meaningful to them. It's the one place you control and you can make sense of all the stuff happening around you. And what I'm trying to do essentially is reinvent that age-old practice in digital form for modern lives and modern work. My message to you is that you need a second brain, a personal system for knowledge management. It's saving little bits of material and content and information from both your physical environment, but more importantly your digital environment to cultivate and retrieve and review it over time. The heart and soul of building a second brain is called code. C for capture, O for organize, D for distill and E for express. Capturing information, organizing it, distilling it and then expressing it in some way. Our memory, especially our working memory, is kind of like the RAM in a computer. It's fast, can make decisions quickly, but what happens when you restart your computer, which is kind of like going to sleep at night, the RAM gets wiped. Notes are simply a way to preserve the value of that thinking so that you can benefit from it again and again and again in the future and not just once. The first question that a lot of people have when they embark on digital note-taking is what should I capture? If you need to know the population of France, just Google that. There is no reason to write that down, but you can't Google a feeling. Often what we're actually seeking when we seek information is a feeling. You can save content that evokes those feelings. Save a photograph that just inspires you. Save some lines from a poem or a song. Save a story that moves you, that touches you, that means something to you. Think about the knowledge and the wisdom that is created out of your life experiences. If you've ever lost a job or had a failure or a disappointment, there are certain lessons, certain bits of, I would say, wisdom that sunk into your soul. That's the kind of stuff that you want to write in your notes and revisit over time because it really reveals things to you about who you are. A great barometer for the things that are worth saving is things that surprise you. Things that are genuinely novel, things that you never encountered before, you never thought about it quite that way before. Often these are things whose meaning is initially unclear. What that is is your subconscious telling you there's something here, there's something valuable or important or something relevant to you even before your logical mind knows what's going on. By saving all of these observations in one single centralized place, your second brain, you drastically increase the odds that you're going to notice how things connect and relate. My father is a professional artist, a painter, has been his entire life, but he's also one of the most productive people I've ever met. I always noticed that people would have this image of my father, oh, he must be so imaginative, just wandering around the house, kind of head in the clouds, and that just could not be further from the truth. In order to do his art and to be prolific with four kids, he had to have rules and routines and structures. Everything had to be very well planned out. And I'd say this is true of any creative endeavor. You can't just leave it up to chance. You can't just leave it purely up to being in the right mood. And that's where productivity is kind of the other half of the coin of creativity, is not inventing something from nothing. It is just applying a tool or a technique or an insight from one domain and then translating it to another one. And this is really what it's all about. That is the very essence of creativity.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 982\n","\n","Link  97 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/J0vm3O12Rpk\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/J0vm3O12Rpk\n","[youtube] J0vm3O12Rpk: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] J0vm3O12Rpk: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 7.41MiB in 02:01\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  The habits that are small at the beginning, like grabbing a chocolate bar when you're checking out the grocery line, may be fine at the beginning. But as you go along, you can see that habits are hard to break. There are triggers that we all have that lead us to these habits that are invisible for us to see every single day. Why are bad habits around money so hard to tackle? In the course of your day, about 40% of the things you do are habits. All of this happens behind the scenes without you being aware of that. Because you have no control, it's also hard to break it. When we talk about money, there's ways that we have cues, we have routines, and we have rewards. Sometimes we get so connected to that reward that comes from giving or spending. We continue to do that in a routine way that hurts us. But the great thing is we all have the capacity to change. Small behaviors can have really big impacts over time just through, you know, the power of habit. Getting rid of bad habits or forming new ones will have an impact all the way across the board, not just with your money, but also how you feel mentally, emotionally, and physically. How can you identify what's holding you back? Can you forge healthier spending and saving habits that unlock your financial potential? This is your brain on money. Before our two favorite neuroscientists, Dr. Serf and Dr. Cable, explain how our brain forms habits, Dr. Serf is going to tell us how he got into the brain side of things. After many years of working as a hacker, I ran into Francis Crick, Nobel laureate for discovering the DNA. And he essentially learned about my profession, penetrating banks and the government. And he said, you might as well try to implement that in a much bigger and much more important way. Which is how our brains work. And with his endorsement, I moved from hacking computers into hacking human brains. As a brain hacker, how do habits creep their way into our brain? Habits are patterns of existence in our brain that operate without us paying attention to them. Some habits are so frequent that nature said, you know what, this one, we could hardwire in the brain. That's what breathing is, something that's natural. As soon as you're born, you're born again. And then over the course of our life, there are many things that we do frequently that the brain says, let's move them to a system that is a habit. So it sees that you drive to work every day in the same route. And it says, you know what, let's help the person. Instead of having to navigate, we just have to have one mechanism ignited. And from then on, everything is going to happen automatically. The location in the brain, the striatum, where it happens, we basically can monitor how the brain is operating. And what it takes for each process to happen. You can do a neuroimaging study where you ask someone to repeat the same thing over and over again. Initially, there's lots of areas of the brain involved. But as you do the task over and over again, what you see is fewer and fewer areas that were necessary the first time through. It's only using those neurons and those brain areas that are absolutely non-existent. It's only using those neurons and those brain areas that are absolutely necessary in order to get the task done. It's also how to break it, because now you have to change something that your brain worked hard to make you not be aware of. So what do some of these money habits look like in our daily lives? If my wife was here, she'd probably tell you some of my quirky habits. Dr. James has seen a lot of different money habits with his clients. And he's here to tell you that there is hope in tweaking them. Some of the things I've seen for people is that they might have the resources to pay for things, but somehow they spend all they have because they got used to not having money. They got used to not having extra resources. They got used to maybe not even saving, hyper-focusing on how much they have or are they doing the right thing or the latest trends. When I think about shaping habits, I do think that we can replace them, but it takes real intentional work. If you just say, I'm going to read one page a day or one chapter a day, you will eventually finish the book. And if you finish the book, then you get to another book. That's a great habit to build that started on one page a day. I see it as being able to save a dollar or a few dollars that gets you to multiple dollars that can get you to save it. You know, saving $50 a month is great, but saving $50 a month every single month, putting it in a savings account, the better off you will be because of the magic of compound interest. That is what really makes a difference in your financial life. What we often make a mistake of doing is trying to do everything at all at once. I'm going to stop spending on takeout. I'm going to save for retirement and I'm going to walk to work to save money on gas. Well, that is a lot of change to manage all at once. Instead, a much better way to implement new financial habits is to do one at a time and stick to something that you had set out to do. So what specific course of action can we take to form better habits? Building a better set of habits in your life will start with understanding what stage of change you're in. So you may be in a place of denial, like, I maybe not need to change this habit. So just by saying, you know, I have a habit and I don't like this habit, you all did one small step towards changing it. When you get to the point where you are ready to make a change with the habit, that's in the contemplation stage. So let's say you're in the habit of whipping out your credit card and getting a coffee every morning. If it's feeling good for you, make sure it works for your finances. And if it does, keep on moving forward. If it feels not so good for you, that's usually an indication that you can check in with what's going on financially. Then you move to a preparation stage of actually planning for this change. The more you can associate positive habits or neutral habits with your money with something good, the better off we are. Then you're at action where you're actually putting your foot on the pedal and things are changing, where we create a new habit. We're integrating this in our lifestyle. What I heard with this person with this latte example is that they need a lot of time to kind of prepare themselves before they get to work. So it could be, I'm going to get to work like five, ten minutes early and park a little bit farther away so I can have that time to take that walk, to really get in my head so I can start my day nice and fresh. And then termination is the last stage where we may not have the urge of that habit that we were looking to break. After a few times, there are going to be two habits. And if the second one overwhelms the first one, at some point your brain is going to just cut the original one and you'll have a new habit. As a therapist, I'm always going to say that self-evaluation should be a habit. I mean, I'm number one in that camp. But honestly, I think a lot of people don't do that enough. There's so many things that come from awareness and reflection and maybe even accountability. One way you can support forming a new habit is getting more socially. Tell friends, family members, and maybe even coworkers that you want to make a change. Associations, connections become really important when we share with a friend. We now associate that friend with our goal. Sky is the limit when it comes to how you actually behave and act with money. And holistically, things will be better for your life. If you made the effort to just get with us to this moment in the video, you're a little bit better.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1470\n","\n","Link  98 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/ugIuHWc6Nuc\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/ugIuHWc6Nuc\n","[youtube] ugIuHWc6Nuc: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] ugIuHWc6Nuc: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 6.43MiB in 01:27\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Every choice that you make comes with a trade-off. Money is an invitation to critical thinking. You can afford anything, but not everything. So if there's something that you value, whether it's travel, food, or a house, you can have that thing. You just can't have an endless series of ands. You might not be able to have that thing and something else and something else and something else. And that doesn't just apply to your money. That applies to your time, your focus, your energy, your attention, any limited resource. And life is the ultimate limited resource. So when you practice being better at managing your money, you practice being better at managing your life. My name is Paula Pan. I am the host of the Afford Anything podcast. I want to help you reach financial independence by making smarter decisions with your money. The mistake that I see a lot of people make when they start asking questions about how to manage their money is that oftentimes people will ask a question about a product or a tactic. So for example, they might say, should I use this app or should I invest in cryptocurrency? First principles thinking is stripping away everything and really getting to the root of something. So if you think about a tree, the tactics and the products are like the leaves of a tree. That's the most visible surface. So of course, it's what people might ask about first. But first, let's start with the roots of that tree. The roots of that tree are your values. It's that question of what matters most. And then from those roots stem that trunk of the tree, which is your philosophy of life, the type of life that you want to lead. And from that philosophy, then your objective or your goals. How does that philosophy of living translate into specific goals? That's really that tree trunk. From there, you go out into the branches of the tree and they represent the strategy. Now that you know your philosophy of living, you know your goals, now you can come up with strategies for how to obtain those goals. And then once you have that strategy in place, then those leaves are the tactics and the products. So if you're starting with the question about tactic or product, you've got a leaf in your hand, but you don't have that root system built yet. When personal finance is framed in the context of delayed gratification so that you can have more money when you're 75 years old, it's really hard to get excited about that. But when we reframe that as financial independence and how taking better care of your money leads to this flourishing of freedom of opportunity, of choice, that becomes much more enticing. FI is the point at which your potential passive income, money that comes to you when you're sleeping, typically through investments is enough to cover your basic bills. And the reason that matters is because then endless options open up for you. You have the freedom to do whatever you want, whether that's to stay in your current profession, make a midlife career change, become a full-time parent or travel the world. Whatever choice you want to make, you're able to make that without having to sweat about how you're going to keep the lights on, how you're going to keep the fridge stocked. The pursuit of FI is for everyone, but the first steps that you're going to take will differ depending on where you are in your journey. There are really only three steps to achieving financial independence. Grow the gap, invest the gap, repeat. Grow the gap means to grow the gap between what you earn and what you spend. And there are only two ways to increase that gap, earn more or spend less or both. If you don't make very much like me when I was in my first job out of college making $21,000 a year, at that stage of life, your goal is to increase your income. If you're already making big dollars, but you have a spending problem, the low-hanging fruit is to curb that spending problem and to address the root psychological issues that are leading to that spending problem. Step two is to then invest that gap. My personal feeling is that everyone should aim to save and invest at least 20% of their income. And when I say save and invest, that includes making additional payments towards a debt above and beyond the minimum required, retirement savings, investments in an investment account. It includes building up your emergency fund. Start with the goal of saving 20% and if you're nowhere close to that, increase your savings rate by 1% and do that every month or two. It will take a few years, but you will over time get to that 20% mark. And then step three is repeat. This is a lifetime practice. This is not a quick hit or something that's going to happen overnight. Money management happens for life. There has never been a point in history when the world has not been volatile. A hundred years ago, there was also a pandemic going on and there was a first World War. A decade later, the Great Depression. After that was World War II. After that, event after event after event that affected the entire globe. I came to FI because I was scared and anxious about the volatility in my life and the world. My response to that was to become obsessed with saving as much as I could because it allowed me to not be so scared of the future. It felt psychologically comforting to have these savings. Change is the nature of the world, the nature of time. And so if you're looking out at the big global factors that are happening in the world today and you're feeling fear, embrace it and use that fear as motivation, as fuel to make wise decisions about how you spend your money, your time, your effort. That's how you build a life that's more intentional. And there's a lot of joy in that.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1037\n","\n","Link  99 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/z-GtGH57J9I\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/z-GtGH57J9I\n","[youtube] z-GtGH57J9I: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] z-GtGH57J9I: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 2.41MiB in 00:29\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  I think the physical books just work for me. They work really well for note taking. They work really well for annotation. They give you something tangible. And there's something about it that I can't quite explain, right? Like you can know something's in a book on the left-hand side of the page between page 80 and 90, but if you're reading on a Kindle, you can't do that. So reading on a Kindle is great. And I use a Kindle for traveling. But the vast majority of the reading I do, I try to do in physical books because I can write about the idea in my own penmanship. I can draw arrows and pictures and diagrams and try to connect to the argument that the author's trying to make. Because how can I agree or disagree with somebody if I don't understand the fundamental principles of the argument that somebody's trying to make? One of the ways you can deconstruct that is just sort of being actively attuned to what you're reading. I find when I read on the Kindle, I'm not necessarily as actively engaged in the book. But if I'm taking notes and I'm following along with the article or I'm occasionally underlining a word that I don't even know what it means and I want to go look it up later, but it means that I'm actively reading what I'm paying attention to, which is super important. And also one of the other things that I find easier to do with a physical book, although you can do it with a Kindle book, I call it sort of like the blank sheet. What we do there is we just sort of before you read a book, you take a blank sheet of paper out and you write down what you know about that subject. You can mind map it. You can write it in sort of like bullet points. And then you read maybe a paragraph or not a paragraph, you read a chapter of that book. And that's all the reading time you have for that day. Well, now you go to that sheet and use a different color pen and you just fill in like what gaps did I learn? Did I learn a different terminology for the words? Can I connect it to what I've already read? And then before you pick up the book for the next chapter, you read, you just skim the sheet and it sort of primes your brain for what you're going to read. And I think that that's a really effective way to sort of like not only build on the knowledge you have but connect what you're reading to the existing knowledge. It's going to show you what you learned while you were reading because it's going to be a very visual distinction. It's going to be a different color of ink. And I think that that allows you to sort of like connect it to the book. And I often do that in the jacket of the book where if I don't have a physical piece of paper that's okay because I can just do it on the front cover. That is so much harder when you try to translate that to electronic. It's possible, but it's a lot more difficult.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 557\n","\n","Link  100 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/-QvFkwyX28c\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/-QvFkwyX28c\n","[youtube] -QvFkwyX28c: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] -QvFkwyX28c: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 18.12MiB in 06:20\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  People are getting increasingly anxious about the world that we live in. I'm finding a lot of panic. People that are very online, spending too much time on cable news and social media, and maybe talking to their crazy uncle. This is meant to be a counterbalance to that. You can keep the uncle, but you can also spend some time thinking about deeper analytic trends of what really is an issue that's worth concerning yourself with, how we might be able to respond to it, and also all the things that frankly don't merit, the screaming headlines. What we're talking about in the Top Risk Report are those risks out there globally that are going to have the most likely dramatic implications in changing the way the world works, in ways that are unanticipated by all of the major actors in that world, government actors, the business actors, and the citizens. And they're ranked in terms of impact, imminence, and likelihood. You put those three things together and you get the top risks. I'm Ian Bremmer, president of Eurasia Group, and these are the top risks of 2023. Number 10, water stress. Around the world, so many people think of water as a sudden emergency that needs a quick and immediate policy response. Increasingly, this is an ongoing real-time issue for everyone. Some people have too much water, massive floods in California. Some people have too little, huge challenges with shipping in Europe. Farmers having to consistently change the way they go about their basic productivity on a season-to-season basis because they do not have adequate resources to be able to plant a normal season. This is having the biggest impact on the Middle East and Sub-Saharan Africa, but it's a global issue. There are global responses, just like the COP summits on biodiversity and on carbon emissions, there's a COP summit on water, but no one's ever heard of it because it doesn't really do anything. It hasn't become a priority. Therefore, it's not getting the resources, and therefore, it's getting worse every single year. 2023 is really the first year that I think we can talk about global water as being the kind of ongoing condition of stress that we've already come to learn about carbon, about biodiversity. Number nine, TikTok boom. It's not actually about TikTok. It's about the generation that has grown up on TikTok. It's the most diverse generation we've ever seen in the West. It's also by far the most activist at a young age, believing that they can do much more, guy getting online and by demonstrating, than they can by voting. And that has much greater impact, both in terms of driving agendas that are very important to them, like on climate, like on social equity, also in terms of changing outcomes for people in positions of power. I'm thinking not just about political leaders, but also about industry leaders, CEOs, bankers, and the like. That is going to create big ripple waves across the global economy precisely because it's the most progressive generation. And as a consequence, it will cause more volatility, will lead to more political and economic change, much of which will eventually be welcomed. But the getting from here to there is, of course, going to be a challenge. Number eight, divided states of America. Now, the fact that it's number eight, the United States, and the US is the most powerful country in the world, kind of means it almost didn't make the list. It means that we're not panicking about the future of the United States. But still, divisions in the United States politically are massive, they're much greater than those of other advanced industrial economies around the world. That makes it a lot harder to functionally govern. You saw this with 15 votes. To get Kevin McCarthy barely over the line as Speaker of the House, and he's going to have an impossible time actually holding that party together. You also see this with inability to even address fundamental issues like improving education or dealing with immigration in the United States, even though we all know what the basic answers are. But the big positive in this risk is the fact that all of the people that were running for key positions of governor and secretary of state to oversee upcoming elections, those that were claiming that this election was going to be stolen and they had to stop to steal, they all lost. So as we look forward to 2024, the likelihood of a constitutional crisis in the United States is virtually zero. Number seven is arrested global development. For 50 years, the world has seen incredible human improvement in education, in health and lifespan, in economic growth across the world, it wasn't just a tiny group of rich people that were taking advantage, it was the emergence of a global middle class. We are now seeing that turnaround. We're seeing more people driven into poverty. We're seeing more children leaving school and particularly a burden on women being driven into sexual trafficking, being driven into the informal economy, not being able to experience the basic human rights that they've worked so hard to achieve over the last 50 years. The United Nations estimates that five years of human development on the planet has been lost in the three years since the pandemic has begun. And in 2023, those losses will only accelerate. There are lots of structural reasons for that. Some of it is, of course, the dangers of the pandemic. Some of it is the challenges that came from the disruptions of the Russian invasion in Ukraine, all the supply chain challenges and the inflation that came on the back of it. Some of it is climate change. You put all of those things together and global development is changing trajectory. Number six, energy crunch. The Russian invasion of Ukraine means that the Europeans are no longer getting their gas and much of their oil from Russia, one of the largest energy producers in the world. But the Europeans need their energy. What are they doing? They're spending as much as humanly possible to get the energy from anywhere else they can. That drives prices up, but it also means that developing countries that don't have access to the same deep pockets that the Europeans do are really taking it in the teeth. So over the course of the year, the Europeans are going to experience another challenging winter, in many ways more challenging in 2023 than in 2022, because they don't have the benefits of all of that Russian energy that was coming in at the beginning of the year like they did last year. But also it means that the knock on challenges for the poorer countries that are not commodity producers around the world are going to feel very great stress this year. Number five, Iran in a corner. Demonstrations across Iran erupted months ago with the killing of Masha Amini, a young woman who was not correctly wearing her headscarf, killed by the morality police, so-called, in Iran. And it touched off the greatest demonstrations they've had on the ground since the 1979 revolution. And the Iranian government is only repressing in response. There's no willingness to have a dialogue or compromise. No, in fact, we see increasingly the Iranian government is willing to execute their citizens with no reason. At the same time as that's going on, the JCPOA, the Iranian nuclear deal, the Americans stepped away from unilaterally, the Iranians are stepping away from it too, and they are now achieved nuclear breakout, their willingness to engage in nuclear development enrichment that would allow them to build nuclear weapons when the inspectors aren't there. And finally, the Iranians are Russia's best friend on the global stage. Chinese aren't providing them with military support to invade Ukraine, but Iran is. It's angering the Americans, angering the Europeans. The likelihood we see regime change in Iran is relatively low, and even if it were to occur, it would probably be towards a military dictatorship, not to a democracy. It's not going to help in resolving any of these issues. But the likelihood that we see military confrontation between Iran and a new, not-Yahu-led right-wing coalition in Israel, Saudi Arabia, and even the United States, that's higher than at any point since the Iranian nuclear deal was signed. Number four, inflation shockwaves. Should surprise no one that after a staggering contraction of the global economy that came with COVID, the global economy basically shut down, and an enormous fiscal outlay from every major economy in the world to ensure that all of the people that were suffering and had their businesses closed and lost their jobs would still be able to get through while the economy contracted. And then the economies open up, but not at the same time, and the shipments and ships, they're not in the right place. So what happens as a consequence of all of that? Well, people are ready to spend money, supply chains are massively disrupted, costs go way up, and costs go way up around the world. Doesn't matter if you were Biden, or if you were the Europeans, or you were the Chinese, Brits, the Japanese, everyone experiencing generational levels of inflation. All global growth from 6% in 2021 to 3% in 2022, expecting less than 2% in 2023. That's a global recession. The implications of that around the world will be very serious, especially given levels of present inflation. The wealthy countries have the money to be able to continue to ensure that their working classes, their middle classes are taken care of. But the real issue is for developing countries who don't have the fiscal space to be able to make these payments to restive populations. They'll put policies in place that will only make them much more indebted. Dollar denominated debt in many cases with higher interest rates that they will not be able to service, leading to collapse. The social instability, the political instability that comes from these economic challenges on much of the developing world is at higher levels in 2023 than we have seen in decades. Number three, weapons of mass disruption. The United States back in 1989 when the wall came down was the leading exporter of democracy around the world. Not always with successful outcomes, frequently hypocritically, but nonetheless, that's how the wall came down. That's how the Soviet Union was defeated. In 2023, only 30 years later, the United States has become the principal exporter of tools that destroy democracy. That's not the intention of the US government. It's not even the intention of the technology companies that have these algorithms. It is an unintended consequence of the business model and the AI capabilities. But we are seeing the exploitation of these tools by bad actors with deep fakes in video and other tools that are used both politically and economically to achieve changes in your behavior both in the marketplace and in politics will pose great dangers to representative democracy as well as the proper functioning of the free market. That's why Brazil had their January 8th events that looked an awful lot like those in the United States in January 6 without Instagram, without Facebook, without all of these algorithms driving all these conspiracy theories. You don't get tens of thousands of Brazilians that believe that their election was stolen and are prepared to throw away their futures in order to occupy these buildings. We're going to see a lot more of this. Brazil's not about to fall apart just as the United States was not, but around the world democracies are becoming more vulnerable because these tools are being exported and no one is able to stop them. Number two, Maximum Xi. Xi Jinping is now the undisputed leader of China. He has rid himself of term limits. He can be president for life. He has also surrounded himself in the Communist Party, the entire hierarchy with only loyalists. They don't have checks and balances. As a consequence, he can make mistakes. Those mistakes can be big. They can have major implications for how the world actually works. This is not the way China was run 10 years ago. There was a lot of differentiation between hardliners on the military and people that wanted more pragmatic economic outcomes, technocrats, Shanghai clan, Beijing, you name it. But today you are with Xi or you are out. We saw that with the treatment of the former president, Hu Jintao. Forced removal in front of the entire Communist Party leadership was an extraordinary display of the unique power that Xi Jinping was prepared to exercise. Every person in that room understood that there but for the grace of God or Xi, go there. We saw that with the sudden turn from zero COVID to maximum COVID made by a snap decision of the Chinese president at the end of the year. That level of uncertainty does not just involve changing the path on COVID. It also involves treatment of technology companies, engagement in the global economy, even issues of fundamental national security. Now, the good news is that the United States and China are not in a cold war. They don't want a cold war. Indeed, after the G20 in Bali, Xi Jinping and President Biden put a floor underneath the relationship to ensure that it couldn't continue to deteriorate in ways that would be damaging to both countries. But many companies around the world see maximum Xi and are discomfited by it. As a consequence, they are themselves taking decisions to start to decouple further from the Chinese economy, unwinding globalization, decreasing global market efficiency and creating challenges for the global economy. And number one, rogue Russia. Over the course of one year, Russia has gone from a global power standing as the most important friend without global limits with China's Xi Jinping to becoming a rogue state, isolated from the entire group of advanced industrial economies, cut off economically from Europe, their most important trading partners and facing staggering losses on the battlefield in Ukraine. There is no way for Putin to turn this around. Under any circumstances, he cannot achieve the status quo ante of February 23rd before he decided to invade the independent Ukraine. Rather, NATO is enlarging with thousands of troops forward deployed. Ukraine has become one of the most powerful military states in the continent of Europe. The Europeans have moved away from their energy supply from Russia and they'll never return to it. And from a political perspective, the Russians have become seen as war criminals by the United States and all of its critical allies around the world. Russia is not going anywhere. Putin is not going to be forced out of office in the foreseeable future. And as a consequence, the question is, what is he going to do? Because the reason Putin's losing is because he's fighting not just Ukraine, but NATO. This is essentially a proxy war where the Americans and all of their allies are doing everything they can to provide the training, the intelligence and the military support to ensure that Ukraine can defend itself, retake its territory and bloody the Russians after their illegal invasion. The Russians have taken this war thus far to Ukraine, but it's hard to imagine that it'll stop there. Remember, Russia has 6,000 nuclear weapons more than anybody else in the world. And so they feel that they have the ultimate deterrent to stop a third world war, which means that asymmetric attacks like cyber, like fiber, like proxy strikes, like pipeline attacks, like terrorism into NATO states, much like what the Iranians have done in the Middle East over the past years, does lead to a consolidation of the allies. We saw the Abraham Accords between Israel and the Gulf states. You're seeing NATO becoming much stronger, but it also means much more danger for these countries going forward as well. The potential for mutually assured destruction because of accidents and miscalculations in and around the battlefield will be higher in 2023 as a consequence of this war than at any point since the Cuban Missile Crisis in 1962.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 2728\n","\n","Link  101 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/0NbBjNiw4tk\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/0NbBjNiw4tk\n","[youtube] 0NbBjNiw4tk: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 0NbBjNiw4tk: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 39.10MiB in 08:23\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  My name is Professor Michio Kaku. I'm a professor of theoretical physics at the City University of New York and I specialize in something called string theory. I'm a physicist and some people ask me the question, what has physics done for me lately? I mean, do I get better color television? Do I get better internet reception with physics? And the answer is yes. You see, physics is at the very foundation of matter and energy. We physicists invented the laser beam. We invented the transistor. We helped to create the first computer. We helped to construct the internet. We wrote the world wide web. In addition, we also helped to invent television, radio, radar, microwaves, not to mention MRI scans, PET scans, x-rays. In other words, almost everything you see in your living room, almost everything you see in a modern hospital at some point or other can be traced to a physicist. Now, I got interested in physics when I was a child. When I was eight, a great scientist had just died. I still remember my elementary school teacher coming into the room and announcing that the greatest scientist of our era has just passed away. And that day, every newspaper published a picture of his desk, the desk of Albert Einstein. And the caption said, I'll never forget, the unfinished manuscript of the greatest work of the greatest scientist of our time. And I said to myself, why couldn't he finish it? I mean, what's so hard? It's a homework problem, right? Why didn't he ask his mother? Why can't he finish this problem? So as a child of eight, I decided to find out what was this problem. Years later, I began to realize that it was the theory of everything, the unified field theory, an equation that would summarize all the physical forces in the universe, an equation like E equals MC squared. That equation is half an inch long, and that equation unlocks the secret of the stars. Why do the stars shine? Why does the galaxy light up? Why do we have energy on the earth? But then there was another thing that happened to me when I was around eight years old. I got hooked on the Saturday morning TV shows, in particular, Flash Gordon. And I was hooked. I mean, every Saturday morning, watching programs about aliens from outer space, starships, ray guns, invisibility shields, cities in the sky. That was for me. But after a few years, I began to notice something. First of all, I began to notice that, well, I didn't have blonde hair and blue eyes. I didn't have muscles like Flash Gordon. But it was a scientist who made this series work, in particular, a physicist. He was the one who discovered the ray gun, the starships. He was the one who created the invisibility shield. And then I realized something else. If you want to understand the future, you have to understand physics. Physics is at the foundation of all the gadgetry, the wizardry, all the marvels of the technological age. All of it can be traced to the work of a physicist. Most of science fiction is, in fact, well within the laws of physics, but possible within maybe a hundred years. And then we have impossibilities that may take a thousand years or more. That includes time travel, warp drive, higher dimensions, portals through space and time, stargates, wormholes. You know, if you were to meet your great grandparents of the year 1900, they were dirt farmers back then. They didn't live much beyond the age of 40 on average. Long distance communication in the year 1900 was yelling at your neighbor. And yet, if they could see you now with iPads and iPods and satellites and GPS and laser beams, how would they view you? They would view you as a wizard or sorcerer. However, if we can now meet our grandkids of the year 2100, how would we view them? We would view them as gods. Back in Greek mythology, Zeus could control objects around him by pure thought, materialize objects just by thinking. And their perks being a Greek god, Venus had a perfect body, a timeless body, and we are beginning now to unravel the genetics at the molecular level of the aging process. And then Apollo, he had a chariot that he could ride across the heavens. We will finally have that flying car that we've always wanted to have in our garage. By the year 2100, we will have the power of the gods. To paraphrase Arthur C. Clarke, any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from divinity. So let's now begin our story. The history of physics is the history of modern civilization. Before Isaac Newton, before Galileo, we were shrouded with the mysteries of superstition. People believed in all sorts of different kinds of spirits and demons. What made the planets move? Why do things interact with other things? It was a mystery. So back in the Middle Ages, for example, people read the works of Aristotle. And Aristotle asked the question, why do objects move toward the earth? And that's because, he said, objects yearn, yearn to be united with the earth. And why do objects slow down when you put them in motion? Objects in motion slow down because they get tired. These are the works of Aristotle, which held sway for almost 2000 years until the beginning of modern physics with Galileo and Isaac Newton. When the ancients looked at the sky, the sky was full of mystery and wonder. And in the year 1066, the most important date on the British calendar, there was a comet, a comet which sailed over the battlefield of Hastings. It frightened the troops of King Harold. And a young man from Normandy swept into England and defeated King Harold at the Battle of Hastings, creating the modern British monarchy. But the question is, where did the comet come from? What was this comet that mysteriously paved the way for the coming of the British monarchy? Well, believe it or not, that same comet, the very same comet that initiated the British monarchy, sailed over London once again in 1682. This time, everyone was asking the question, where do comets come from? Do they signal the death of the king? Why do we have messengers from the heavens in the sky? Well, one man dared to penetrate the secrets of comets, and that was Isaac Newton. In fact, when Isaac Newton was only 23 years old, he stumbled upon the universal force of gravitation. According to one story, he was walking on his estate in Wilsthorpe, and he saw an apple fall. And then Isaac Newton saw the moon. And then he asked the key question, which helped to unlock the heavens. If apples fall, does the moon also fall? And the answer was yes. And that answer overturned thousands of years of mystery and speculation about the motions of the heavens. The moon is in free fall. Just like an apple, the moon is constantly falling toward the earth. It doesn't hit the earth because it spins around the earth, and the earth is round, but it's acting under a force, a force of gravity. So Newton immediately tried to work out the mathematics, and he realized that the mathematics of the 1600s was not sufficient to work out the motion of a falling moon. So what did Isaac Newton do? When he was 23 years old, not only did he stumble upon the force of gravity, but he also created calculus. In fact, he created calculus at the rate at which you learn it when you are a freshman in college. And why did he create calculus? To calculate the motion of a falling moon. The mathematics of his age was incapable of calculating the trajectories of objects moving under an inverse square force field. And that's what Isaac Newton did. He worked out the motion of the moon. And then he realized that if he understands the moon, he also understands the motion of the planets in the solar system. And Isaac Newton invented a new telescope. It was the reflecting telescope, and he was tracking the motion of this comet. Well, it turns out that everyone was talking about the comet, including a rather wealthy Englishman by the name of Edmund Halley. So Edmund Halley, being a wealthy merchant, decided to make a trip to Cambridge to talk to England's illustrious scientist, Sir Isaac Newton. Well, Edmund Halley asked Newton, what do you make of this comet? No one understands comets. They're a mystery. They've been fascinating people for centuries, for millennia. What are your thoughts? And then, I paraphrase, but Isaac Newton said something like this. He said, oh, that's easy. That comet is moving in a perfect ellipse. It's moving in an inverse square force field. I've been tracking it every day with my reflecting telescope, and the path of that comet conforms to my mathematics exactly. And of course, we don't know what Edmund Halley's reaction was, but I paraphrase. He must have said something like this. For God's sake, man, why don't you publish the greatest work in all of scientific history? If correct, you have decoded the secret of the stars, the secret of the heavens. Nobody understands where comets come from. And then Newton responded and said, oh, well, it costs too much. I mean, I'm not a wealthy man. It would cost too much to summarize this calculus that I've invented and to work out all the motion of the stars. And then Halley must have said this. Mr. Newton, I am a wealthy man. I have made my fortune in commerce. I will pay for the publication of the greatest scientific work in any language. And it was Principia, the principles, the mathematical principles that guide the heavens. Believe it or not, this is perhaps one of the most important works ever written by a human being in the 100,000 years since we evolved from Africa. Realize that this book sets into motion a physics of the universe. Forces that control the motion of the planets, forces which can be calculated, forces which govern the motion of cannonballs, rockets, pebbles, everything that moves, moves according to the laws of motion and the calculus of Sir Isaac Newton. In fact, even today when we launch our space probes, we don't use Einstein's equations. They only apply when you get near the speed of light or near a black hole. We use Newton's laws of gravity. They are so precise that when we shoot a space probe right past the rings of Saturn, we use exactly the same equations that Isaac Newton unraveled in the 1600s. That's why we've been able to unravel the secrets of the solar system, complements of the laws of motion of Isaac Newton. So what Newton did was not only did he set into motion the ability to calculate planets, he also set into motion a mechanics. Machines now operated upon well-defined laws, Newton's three laws of motion. The first law of motion says that objects in motion stay in motion forever unless acted on by an outside force. You see that in an ice skating rink. You shoot a puck and it goes all the way down forever unless acted on by an outside force. That's different from Aristotle's law of motion. Aristotle said objects in motion eventually stop because they get tired. The second law of motion says force is mass times acceleration and that equation made possible the industrial revolution. Steam engines, locomotives, factories, machines, all of it due to the mechanics set into motion by Isaac Newton's second law of motion, force is equal to mass times acceleration. And then Newton had a third law of motion. For every action there's an equal and opposite reaction, that's the law of rockets. That's why we have rockets that can sail into outer space. So the lesson here is when scientists unraveled the first force of the universe, gravity, that set into motion the industrial revolution. A revolution which toppled the kings and queens of Europe, which displaced feudalism, ushering in the modern age, all because a 23-year-old gentleman looked up and asked the question, does the moon also fall? You know, when I was a kid growing up in California, I would see pictures of the Empire State Building and I said to myself, how could they possibly build such a big building and not know that it's going to fall? Why doesn't it fall? They didn't build scale models of the thing. You couldn't have an Empire State Building that big to test whether it's going to fall or not. How did they know ahead of time that that building wouldn't fall? And the answer is Newton's laws of motion. In fact, today I teach Newton's laws of motion and you can actually calculate the forces on every single brick of the Empire State Building. Using Newton's second law of motion, force is mass times acceleration. When Newton unraveled the force of gravity, that was the first force. Now let's take a look at the second force, an even greater force, which has touched all of our lives, and that is the electromagnetic force. Ever since humans saw lightning bolts light up the sky, ever since they were terrified by the sound of thunder, they've been asking, do the gods propel lightning bolts and create thunder? Are they angry at us? Scientists begin to realize that the lightning bolts and the thunder can be duplicated on the earth, that we can actually create many lightning bolts using electricity. But it wasn't until the 1800s that finally we began to unlock the second great force which rules the universe, the electromagnetic force. Michael Faraday would give Christmas lectures in London, fascinating everyone from adults to children, and he would demonstrate the incredible properties of electricity. Some people, for example, ask a simple question. If you're in a car or an airplane and you get hit by a lightning bolt, why don't you all get electrocuted? Why don't you all die? Well, Faraday answered the question. He would create a cage. He would walk into this steel cage, electrify it, and he wouldn't get electrocuted at all. That's called the Faraday cage, and every time you walk into a metal structure, you get shielded by this metal object. Well, what Michael Faraday did was he helped to unleash the second great revolution with something called Faraday's law. A moving wire in a magnetic field has its electrons pushed, creating an electrical current. That simple idea unleashed the electric revolution, and that's why we have hydroelectric generators, dams that can produce enormous amounts of power. That's why people build nuclear power plants. That's why we have electricity in this room right now. On a very small scale, you use that in your bicycle. When you put a bicycle lamp on your bicycle, the turning of the wheel spins a magnet. The magnet then pushes electrons in a wire, and that's why electricity lights up in your bicycle lamp. So, in other words, electricity and magnetism were unified into a single force. We once thought that electricity and magnetism were separate. Now we know they are, in fact, the same force. So, if a moving magnet can create an electric field, this means that a moving electric field can create a magnetic field. But if they can create each other, why can't they oscillate and create a wave so that moving electric fields create magnetic fields, create electric fields, create magnetic fields, infinite them to create a wave? Well, around the time of the American Civil War, a mathematical physicist, James Clerk Maxwell, calculated using the work of Faraday the velocity of this wave. In one of the greatest breakthroughs of all time, James Clerk Maxwell calculated the velocity of this wave and found out it was the velocity of light. And then he made this incredible discovery. This is light. That's what light is. It doesn't by accident travel at the speed of electricity. It is light itself. And the equations were written down by James Clerk Maxwell. Unfortunately, Michael Faraday himself did not have a formal education. He could not put into mathematical form his own work. James Clerk Maxwell was a theoretical physicist, just like myself. He wrote down the mathematical physics of oscillating electric fields and magnetic fields, and they are called Maxwell's equations. These equations have to be memorized by every physicist in grad school. You cannot get your PhD without memorizing these equations. Every engineer who deals with radar and radio has to memorize these equations. And so, if you go to Berkeley where I got my PhD, you can buy a t-shirt which says, in the beginning, God said, the four-dimensional divergence of an anti-symmetric second-rank tensor equals zero, and there was light. Ladies and gentlemen, this is the equation for light. The consequences of the electromagnetic revolution touch all of us. This is a picture of the Earth from outer space. Look at this picture. Europe electrified. You can actually see the fruits of all of our efforts to create electricity to energize our lives in one picture, seeing the Earth from outer space. So let's now talk about how Faraday and Maxwell's work touches your life as well. This is the Internet. The Internet is a simple byproduct of the electromagnetic force, and you can see that where there is the Internet, there is prosperity. There is science. There is entertainment. There is economic activity. Where there is no Internet, there is poverty. And in the future, the Internet will be miniaturized and will be placed in your glasses. Your glasses will recognize people's faces and display their biography next to the image as you talk to them. And then, when they speak Chinese to you, your glasses will translate Chinese into English and print out subtitles right beneath their image. So in the future, you will know exactly who you are talking to without even talking to them. And this means that at a cocktail party, if you're looking for a job but you don't know who the heavy hitters are, in the future you will know exactly who to suck up to. In the future, chips will only cost a penny because we can manufacture tinier and tinier transistors. You will have Faraday's electromagnetic force inside your body. This is a pill. It has a chip in it. The chip is smaller than an aspirin pill. It also has a TV camera and a magnet. When you swallow it, the magnet guides the camera, taking pictures of your stomach, your intestines, because we all know what middle-aged men fear the most, colonoscopies. And this gives new meaning for the expression, Intel inside. Now, let's talk about the next great forces which rule the universe. We talked about gravity, which allows us to calculate the motion of the planets. The mechanics created by Newton helped to unleash the Industrial Revolution. Michael Faraday worked out the electromagnetic force which gave us the wonders of the electric age. And now let's talk about the nuclear age, the stars and the sun. People have been fascinated by the sun. Apollo was the god that strode across the heavens in his fiery chariot. But hey, when you calculate how long coal or oil will burn like the sun, you realize that in just a few hundred years, the sun would burn to a crisp. So what could possibly last for billions of years? There must be a new force, a nuclear force. Einstein and others helped to unravel the secret of the stars. The nuclear force comes in two types, weak and strong. The weak nuclear force governs radioactive decay. The strong nuclear force is one of the strongest forces in the entire universe. It's so strong, it holds our protons together ever since Genesis, the beginning of time. The equation which allows for the liberation of energy is Einstein's famous equation E equals mc squared. What Einstein showed was that the faster you move, the heavier you get. So your weight is not a constant. When you move very rapidly, you get heavier, something which we measure every day in the laboratory. Now this means that the energy of motion transformed into mass, could you get heavier? Now listen carefully. The faster you move, the heavier you get, which means the energy of motion E turns into m, your mass. And the relationship between E and m is very simple. It takes one second to write it down on a sheet of paper. It is exactly E equals mc squared. So the nuclear force helped to explain the secret of the sun, but it also created a Pandora's box. Because inside the nucleus of the atom are particles. And when you smash these particles, what do you get? More particles. And when you smash them, what do you get? More particles. In fact, we are drowning in subatomic particles. Hundreds, thousands of subatomic particles every time we smash atoms. Now we smash atoms using something called atom smashers or particle accelerators. I built my own particle accelerator when I was in high school. When I was in high school, I went to my mom one day and I said, mom, can I have permission to build a 2.3 million electron volt beta-tron particle accelerator in the garage? And my mom said, sure, why not? And don't forget to take out the garbage. So I went to Westinghouse and as a high school kid I asked for 400 pounds of transformer steel. I asked for 22 miles of copper wire because I wanted to create a 6 kilowatt, 10,000 gauss magnetic field to energize my atom smasher. With 22 miles of copper wire, how could you wind it? We did it on the high school football field. I put 22 miles of copper wire on the goal post, gave it to my mother. She ran to the 50 yard line unraveling the spool of wire. She gave it to my father who then ran to the goal post and we wound 22 miles of copper wire on the high school football field. Well finally my atom smasher was ready. It consumed 6 kilowatts of power. That's every single ounce of power that my house could deliver. I plugged my ears, I closed my eyes, I turned on the power and I heard this huge crackling sound as 6 kilowatts of power surged through my capacitor bank. And then I heard a pop pop pop sound as I blew out every single circuit breaker in the house. The whole house was plunged in darkness. My poor mom, every time she'd come home she would see the lights flicker and die. And she must have wondered, why couldn't I have a son who plays baseball? Why can't he learn basketball? And for God's sake, why can't he find a nice Japanese girl? I mean, why does he have to build these machines in the garage? Well, these machines that I built in my garage earned the attention of a physicist, Edward Teller, father of the hydrogen bomb. And he arranged for me to get a scholarship to Harvard. And my career got a head start. He knew exactly what I was doing. I didn't have to explain to him that I was experimenting with antimatter. I was creating anti-electrons in my mom's garage and using atom smasher to eventually create beams of antimatter. Antimatter is the opposite of matter. It has the opposite charge. So an electron has negative charge. The positron or anti-electron has positive charge. This means that you can now create anti-molecules and anti-atoms. Anti-hydrogen was made at CERN outside Geneva, Switzerland, and also at Fermilab outside Chicago, where I have anti-electrons circling around antiprotons. And in Brookhaven National Laboratory in Long Island just recently, they detected anti-helium. We have two anti-protons with two anti-neutrons to create anti-helium. For every piece of matter, there's a counterpart which is made out of antimatter. And when the two collide, by the way, it releases the greatest energy source in the universe. It is 100% conversion of matter to energy by Einstein's equations E equals mc squared. Inside the nucleus of the atom, we have particles upon particles when you smash them apart. In the 1950s, we were drowning in subatomic particles. In fact, J. Robert Oppenheimer, the father of the atomic bomb, once made a statement. He declared that the Nobel Prize in Physics should go to the physicist who does not discover a new particle this year. That's how many particles were being discovered. So let's talk about the particle zoo. Right now, we physicists have unlocked hundreds, thousands of subatomic particles, and we've been able to piece them together into a jigsaw puzzle. It's called the Standard Model. It has 36 quarks, 19 free parameters, three generations of quarks, no rhyme, no reason, but this is the most fundamental basis of reality that we physicists have been able to construct. Billions of dollars, 20 Nobel prizes have gone into the creation of the Standard Model, and it is the ugliest theory known to science. But it works. There's one piece missing, and that one piece that's missing is called the Higgs boson. We expect to find it. We want to create a higher version of this theory, and that theory, we think, is string theory. String theory is based on the simple idea that all the four forces of the universe, gravity, the electromagnetic force, and the two nuclear forces, can be viewed as music. Music of tiny little rubber bands. So if I had a super microscope and I could look right into the heart of an electron, what would I see? I would see a vibrating rubber band. And if I twang it, it turns into a neutrino. I twang it again, it turns into a quark. I twang it again, it turns into a Yang-Mills particle. In fact, if I twang it enough times, I get thousands of subatomic particles that have been cataloged patiently in the universe. Patiently by physicists. String theory, we think, is a theory of everything. Now, string theory, in turn, can be summarized in an equation about an inch long. That's my equation. This is called string field theory. And how will we test it? We are building a machine. The biggest machine of science ever built in the history of the human race, outside Geneva, Switzerland. It is the Large Hadron Collider. So the Higgs boson, we think, will be created by the Large Hadron Collider. A tube 17 miles in circumference with two beams of protons circulating in opposite directions, then slamming together, creating a shower of particles. And among these particles, we hope to find the Higgs boson. But not only that, we hope to find particles even beyond the Higgs boson. The next set of particles beyond the Higgs boson are Spartacles. The next layer of the jigsaw puzzle are called Spartacles, Super Particles, nothing but higher vibrations, higher musical notes of a vibrating string. And what else could we do? We can also unlock the secrets of the Big Bang. You see, Einstein's equations break down at the instant of the Big Bang and the center of a black hole. The two most interesting places in the universe are beyond our reach using Einstein's equations. We need a higher theory. And that's where string theory comes in. String theory takes you before the Big Bang, before Genesis itself. And what does string theory say? It says that there is a multiverse of universes. Where did the Big Bang come from? Well, Einstein's equations give us this compelling picture that we are like insects on a soap bubble, a gigantic soap bubble which is expanding, and we are trapped like flies on fly paper. We can't escape the soap bubble. And that's called the Big Bang theory. String theory says there should be other bubbles out there. In a multiverse of bubbles, when two universes collide, it can form another universe. When a universe splits in half, it can create two universes and that, we think, is the Big Bang. The Big Bang is caused either by the collision of universes or by the fissioning of universes. If there are other dimensions, if there are other universes, can we go between universes? Well, that of course is very hard. However, Alice in Wonderland gives us a possibility that maybe one day we might create a wormhole between universes. This is a wormhole. Think of taking a sheet of paper and putting two dots on it. The shortest distance between two points is a straight line. But if I can fold, if I can fold that sheet of paper, then perhaps I can create a shortcut, a shortcut through space and time called a wormhole. This is a genuine solution of Einstein's equations. We can actually see this in string theory. The question is, how practical is it to go through one of these things? We don't know. In fact, there's a debate among physicists today, Stephen Hawking. Many physicists are jumping into the game of trying to figure out whether it's physically possible to go all the way through a wormhole. Because if you could, then you might be able to use this as a time machine. Since string theory is a theory of everything, it's also a theory of time. And time machines are allowed in Einstein's equations, but to build one is extremely difficult. Far more energy is required than a simple DeLorean with plutonium. You know, trillions of years from now, the universe is going to get awfully cold. We think the universe is headed for a big freeze. All the stars will blink out. Stars will cease to twinkle. The universe will be so big, it'll be very cold. At that point, all intelligent life in the universe must die. The laws of physics are a death warrant to all intelligent life. There's only one way to escape the death of the universe, and that is leave the universe. We are now, of course, entering the realm of science fiction, but at least we now have equations, equations of string theory, which will allow us to calculate if it is possible to go through a wormhole, to go to another universe where it's warmer, and perhaps we can start all over again. If you were to summarize the march of physics over the last 10,000 years, it would be the distillation of the laws of nature into four fundamental forces, gravity, electricity, and magnetism, and the two nuclear forces. But then the question is, is there a fifth force, a force beyond the forces that we can measure in the laboratory? And believe it or not, there are physicists who've actually looked very carefully for a fifth force. Some people think maybe it's psychic phenomena, maybe it's telepathy, maybe it's something called psi power, maybe it's the power of the mind, maybe consciousness. Well, I'm a physicist. We believe in testing theories to make sure that they are falsifiable and reproducible. We want to make sure that on demand your theory works every single time without exception. And if your theory fails one time, it's wrong. In other words, Einstein's theory has to work every single time without exception. One time, Einstein's theory is proven to be wrong, the whole theory is wrong. Well, so far we can reproduce these four physical theories, but a fifth theory cannot be reproduced. We've looked for it. Some people think that maybe a fifth force may be short-range, like not over the nucleus of the atom, but ranging over several feet. And we can't find any. We physicists in the last ten years have discovered a new energy source larger than the galaxy itself. Dark energy. Realized in our universe today, 73% of our universe, the matter of energy, 73% is in the form of dark energy, the energy of nothing. That's what's blowing the galaxies farther and farther apart. That's the energy of the Big Bang itself. Kids ask the question, if the universe banged, then what made it bang? And the answer is dark energy. 73% of the universe's energy is dark energy. 23% is dark matter. Dark matter is invisible matter. If I held it in my hand, it would go right through my hand. It holds the galaxy together. 23% of the universe is dark matter. Stars made out of hydrogen and helium make up 4% of the universe. And then what about us? We, the higher elements, we made out of oxygen, carbon, nitrogen, tungsten, iron, we make up 0.03% of the universe. In other words, we are the exception. The universe is mainly made out of dark energy. The universe is mainly made out of dark matter, overwhelming the stars, overwhelming the galaxies in fact. Now what is dark matter, which makes up 23% of the universe? No one knows. String theory gives us a clue, but there's no definitive answer. So in other words, for you young, aspiring physicists out there in the audience, you may be saying to yourself right now, why should I go into physics? Because you guys already have a candidate for the unified field theory, right? Just realize that every single physics textbook is wrong. Every single physics textbook on the earth says that the universe is mainly made out of atoms, right? There it is. The universe is mainly made out of atoms. Wrong. In the last 10 years, we have come to the realization that most of the universe is dark. And there's a whole shelf full of Nobel prizes for the young people who can figure out the secret of dark matter and dark energy. Let me give some advice to you. If you are a young physicist, perhaps just getting out of high school, you have dreams of being Einstein, of dreams of working on string theory and stuff like that. And then you hit freshman physics. Let me be blunt. We physicists flunk most students taking elementary physics, and we're more or less encouraged to do so by the engineering department. We don't want to train engineers who make bridges that fall down. We don't want to create engineers that create skyscrapers that fall over. There's a bottom line. You have to know the laws of mechanics. So before you can work with the laws of Einstein, you have to work with the laws of friction, levers, pulleys, and gears. As a consequence, we have a very high flunk-out rate in elementary physics. So if you're a young physicist, graduating from high school with stars in your eyes, and you encounter freshman physics for the first time, watch out. If you have a rough time, that's the way it is. I started out my life as an experimental physicist. Then I went to Harvard, and then I talked to my advisor, one of the world's greatest experimental physicists, Professor Pound, and he told me that maybe it's time to give it a rest. He said to me, your skills are much better suited to what you love the most, which is theory, mathematics, the world of higher dimensions. And I realized that he was probably right. The thing about physics or even science that really intrigues me the most is to find the most fundamental basis for everything. Rather than trying to massage a theory or make a theory prettier, why not find out why it works, what makes it tick? And that's what I do for a living. I'm a theoretical physicist.

You know, Marvel movies have been leaning into it. Doctor Strange and the Multiverse of Madness, various Spider-Man movies, but also Rick and Morty and everything everywhere all at once. You might think it's the fault of physics because physicists have been talking about a multiverse for a few decades now, both in cosmology and quantum mechanics. But in fact, as often happens in Hollywood and elsewhere, you ignore what the scientists say and you do your own kind of thing. The kind of multiverse that is being used in Hollywood is more like the philosophical idea of the set of all possible worlds. It's clear why this would be so interesting to people because we've all made decisions. We've all wondered what life would be like if they were a little bit different, if an election had gone a different way, if our team had gone a different way, if we had not gotten hurt, if we had asked that person out for a date. And this sort of makes us think, well, maybe we're in the wrong universe. We're in the wrong timeline. There's another world out there. That's the one I want to be in. Now, science comes along, physics, my own field, and says, you know, it's possible. There literally are other universes out there, places where things are different. But there's different ways in which science can lead us to the idea of a multiverse. I'm Sean Carroll. I'm a theoretical physicist and philosopher at Johns Hopkins University. And I'm the author of The Biggest Ideas in the Universe, Space, Time and Motion. I think it's really important when we're thinking about physicists' versions of the multiverse to realize physicists never start out by saying, hey, wouldn't it be cool if there were a multiverse? It is always the place they're dragged to kicking and screaming because they're trying to explain what we do observe. You know, a big criticism of multiverse ideas is that you can't observe the multiverse. You can't falsify it. You can't test it, et cetera. But what you can do is observe what happens in ours. And what you want to do as a scientist is come up with a theory, which is a kind of a story, a theory that accounts for what we see, for the data that we can have access to. And some theories, some very, very simple, very easy to write down theories, like the inflationary theory of cosmology or the many worlds theory of quantum mechanics. They both explain what we see in our universe and unambiguously predict the existence of other universes. In cosmology, which is maybe the most famous one up until recently, there's literally just parts of our universe that are so far away where conditions can be radically different. They can either be kind of like us, but with different details or even different laws of physics, different particles and forces and the whole shebang. There's an entirely different conception called the many worlds of quantum mechanics, which is both in some sense more realistic and easy to bring into reality, but also more mind blowing. It just says whenever you have a quantum mechanical system, which spoiler alert, all systems are quantum mechanical at heart. But whenever you measure it in a particular way, you can get different possible measurement outcomes. This is something we've understood for a hundred years now. The question is, what happens to the alternative measurement outcomes that you didn't observe? So if you have a particle, an elementary particle like an electron, and you're going to observe its location or its spin or something like that, the equations will tell you that certain outcomes are possible. Certain outcomes are not. An electron is never going to turn into a proton. They have different electrical charges that will literally never happen. But the electron could be spinning either clockwise or counterclockwise. And the many worlds version of quantum mechanics says both of those will generically come true in different universes. So this is literally a parallel universe. This isn't someplace very, very far away. This is a simultaneously existing reality where the outcome of a quantum mechanical experiment turned out differently to ours. And if big noticeable things in the world depend on the outcome of that experiment, you could wind up in a very different looking universe. Human beings love to put themselves at the center of every story. So when you start talking about the multiverse and different ways things could have gone, they instantly start thinking, oh, if I had made a different decision, things would have turned out differently. And that's fine if you're just being philosophical and thinking about the space of all possible ways the world could have gone. But if you're thinking like a physicist, you solve the equations. It has literally nothing to do with human beings making decisions. If you think about the cosmological multiverse, the other universes are literally billions of light years away. They have nothing to do with you and your choices throughout the day. The quantum mechanics multiverse is a little bit of a different story because it does happen sort of everywhere. There's things going on that create two parallel realities. But the things that are going on are not human beings making decisions. They're subatomic particles being measured in some quantum mechanical way. If anything, it's the quantum measurements that force you to make a decision, not your decisions forcing different universes to come into existence. After all, you are a body made of a whole bunch of quantum mechanical particles, electrons and protons and neutrons. If you choose to describe yourself that way, there are different versions of you branching the universe. So then you have to ask, well, if I could have seen the electron spinning clockwise or counterclockwise and I saw it spinning counterclockwise, what is my relationship to the person who saw it spinning clockwise? Are they me just in a different universe or are they a separate person? I think the clear answer here is there's a relationship, but they're a different person. It's very much like identical twins. You have one fertilized egg. There's at one point in time, a single cell that is one entity there in the universe, but it splits into two different people. I think that's how we should think about different versions of ourselves in the multiverse. They might share a past, but once they've diverged, once they're in a universe of their own, they are now separate people. It's not weird or impossible to contemplate. It's just a slightly more sophisticated version of our notion of personal identity updated for the multiverse. I absolutely believe we can imagine thinking about the multiverse as a useful psychological tool or personal tool, right? Visualization exercises have been part of psychology for a long time. And so when we physically imagine ourselves embodied in different set of circumstances, we think about that possibility differently. And the multiverse is sort of a nudge in that direction. And maybe you can argue that technology these days is making that more possible. We see other lives in a more vivid way than maybe we used to, with virtual realities, with alternate ways of thinking about ourselves, augmented reality, just wearing a headset in the world that we're in. Apparently, there's a whole genre of Zillow porn, which is not actually pornography. It's just getting kicks out of looking at houses you can't afford on Zillow and imagining what it would be like to live there. We're sort of peeking into alternate realities that didn't come true. These could be both positive and negative psychological tools. We use them in the right way by imagining the way things could have gone better and then saying, okay, what do I need to do to increase the chances that next time it actually will go better? But it's psychologically not healthy to push that too far because there are some decisions we can't undo. This is why we talked about the serenity prayer, right? The ability to recognize what we can change, what we can't, and accept the things that we can't, as well as to be able to tell the difference. You can imagine in a multiverse having made all sorts of different decisions. But in fact, there's no such thing as time travel in the real world. You cannot actually go back and remake the decisions differently. It's fine to imagine all sorts of possibilities, but at the end of the day, we have to live and affect the universe that we're in. I'd like to think, maybe I'm being a physicist here more than a human being, but I'd like to think that by contemplating all of these different possibilities, past, present, and future, we can put things in perspective. We can think about how, yeah, there was that moment when things went terribly wrong. Either maybe I did something wrong or there was an unforeseen event that I couldn't have controlled. But you know what, the causal influence I have on the world only extends toward the future. The choices I can make right now will have an impact that I will feel down the road, but I cannot make a choice right now that undoes what happened in the past. I think this is a truth about physics and cosmology and the world, and psychologically is a very important principle to keep in mind.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1606\n","\n","Link  103 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/DBG1Wgg32Ok\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/DBG1Wgg32Ok\n","[youtube] DBG1Wgg32Ok: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] DBG1Wgg32Ok: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 15.97MiB in 04:00\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  A number of people warned me against writing a book about boys and men because it's such a fraught subject, particularly in politics right now, and because so many people were afraid that merely drawing attention to the problems of boys and men was implying somehow less effort being paid to girls and women, that it's framed as a zero sum, and it's sort of a whose side are you on question, and you have to be on one side or the other rather than just being on the side of human flourishing. One of the real challenges here is that if there are men missing from certain crucial areas of our society and our economy, that makes it harder for other men and boys to flourish in those areas. We have an education system that has a dearth of male teachers. We have a labor market where the jobs that are growing fastest are ones where we have the fewest men, and in families there's the growth in what you might call the dad deficit or fatherlessness. As men are struggling in each of those areas, what you'll see is it'll be harder for other men to follow in their footsteps. It's harder for boys to flourish if their fathers aren't engaged. It's harder for men to enter occupations where there aren't men. It's harder for boys to do well at school where there are no male teachers to be seen. And so there's a very real danger that unless we act quite soon that we will set in train, something of a vicious cycle. I'm Richard Reeves. I'm a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, and my latest book is Of Boys and Men, Why the Modern Male is Struggling, Why That Matters, and What to Do About It. The overall picture is that on almost every measure, at almost every age, and in almost every advanced economy in the world, the girls are leaving the boys way behind and the women leaving the men. What nobody expected was that girls and women wouldn't just catch up to boys and men in education, but would blow right past them and keep going. Everyone was very focused, quite rightly, on getting to gender equality, getting to gender parity. It's not that long ago where there was a huge gender gap the other way, and there was huge focus, correctly, in the 70s and 80s to really promote women and girls in education. But the line just kept going, and nobody predicted that. Nobody was saying, what if gender inequality re-emerges in just as big a way as now, in some cases bigger, but the other way around? And to some extent, everyone's still trying to get their head around this new world where, at least in education, when you talk about gender inequality, you're pretty much always talking about the ways in which girls and women are ahead of boys and men. And that's happened in a very, very short period of human history. So if you look at the US, for example, in the average school district in the US, girls are almost a grade level ahead of boys in English, and have caught up in math. If we look at those with the highest GPA scores, the top 10%, two thirds of those are girls. If we look at those at the bottom, two thirds of those are boys. When it comes to going to college, there's a 10% gap in college enrolment, a similar size gap in completing college, conditional on enrolling. And the result of those trends is that the gender gap in getting a college degree is now wider than it was in 1972, but the other way around. So in 1972, when Title IX was passed to promote more gender equality in education, there was a 13 percentage point gap in favour of men getting college degrees. Now there's a 15 percentage point gap in favour of women getting college degrees. So the gender inequality we see in college today is wider than it was 50 years ago. It's just the other way around. There's quite a fierce debate about the differences between male and female brains, and in adulthood, I think there's not much evidence that the brains are that different in ways that we should worry about or that are particularly consequential. But where there's no real debate is in the timing of brain development. It is quite clear that girls' brains develop more quickly than boys' brains do, and that the biggest difference seems to occur in adolescence. So what happens is in adolescence, we develop what neuroscientists call the prefrontal cortex. The prefrontal cortex of our brain is sometimes known as the CEO of the brain. It's the bit of your brain that says you should do your chemistry homework rather than going out to party. It's the bit of your brain that says it is worth maintaining a high GPA because it will help you get to college, which might help you in the future. And that bit of the brain develops considerably earlier in girls than in boys, between one and two years earlier, partly because girls go into puberty a bit earlier than boys, and that seems to trigger some of this development. What that means is that if you have an education system that rewards the ability to turn in homework, stay on task, worry about your GPA, prepare for college and so on, then just structurally that's going to put an advantage the group whose brains have developed earlier in those particular areas. And that turns out, on average, to be girls. I think it's a great irony of women's progress that by taking the breaks off women's educational opportunities and aspirations, we've revealed the fact that the education system is slightly structured against boys and men because of these differences in the timing of brain development. But it took the women's movement to show that because the natural advantages of women in education were impossible to see when women's aspirations were being capped by a sexist society. Now that those caps have been largely removed, we can see that it's boys and men who are at a disadvantage in the education system. At the risk of sounding boring, let's collect the data first so we know what we're dealing with here. I do think that we should be strongly encouraging boys to start school a year later than girls. I think that should become the default in many school districts because of the developmental gap that there is between boys and girls. Because boys' brains mature more slowly, then them starting school a year later would mean that they were developmentally closer to being peers with the girls in the classroom. We need a lot more male teachers. It's striking that the teaching profession has become steadily more female over time. Only 24% of K-12 teachers now are male. That's down from 33% in the 80s. And fewer men are applying to teacher training year on year. And so we've seen this steady shift towards a close to an all-female environment that has all kinds of consequences for the ethos of the school, for the way we deal with different kinds of behavior among boys and girls, for example. And so we need a very serious and intentional effort to get more men into teaching. The third thing I would do in this world where I have significant power to dictate policies would be significantly more investment in vocational education and training. That is an area where we do seem to see better results for boys and men on average and one that's woefully under-invested in in the U.S. The U.S. has really bet most of its dollars on a very academic, a very narrow route towards success and less emphasis on vocational training. And that has actually put boys and men at a disadvantage. So apprenticeships, technical high schools are actually a really good way to help more boys and men. I think one of the challenges with this debate is that if you're talking to women and men who are, say, at the top of the economic ladder, four-year college degrees, decent incomes, they look around and they don't see some of these issues. But that's not the same for working class men. That's not the same for men lower down the economic ladder. So there's a danger that we're so busy to borrow Sheryl Sandberg's phrase, so busy leaning in, that we don't look down. The reality for men further down the ladder is very different. The economic trends for men have turned downwards along four dimensions. One is wages. Most men today earn less than most men did in 1979. In employment, with a drop in labour force participation of eight percentage points, which means nine million men now of prime age are not working. We've seen a drop in occupational stature. And so there are now more men working in employment areas, which are seen as lower status than they were in the past. And we've also seen a drop in the acquisition of skills, the kinds of skills and education that boys and men need. If boys don't get educated and men don't get skilled, they will struggle in the labour market. And across all of those domains, we've seen a downward turn for men in the last four or five decades. And so the way in which social class divides have opened up, economic inequality has widened, is really important to understand in the context of gender inequality. If we only focus on gender gaps, then we miss the fact that both men and women at the top have done increasingly well. But that's much less true of everybody else, and especially it's less true of those from lower income backgrounds, working class boys and men and black boys and men. You see many of those trends are amplified. And so those boys and men are really at the sharpest end of many of the social and economic changes. On the one hand, we have a huge and successful and laudable effort to get more women into STEM jobs. So science, technology, engineering and math. On the other side, we have what I call HEAL jobs. So that's health, education, administration and literacy, almost if you like the opposite side of the coin to STEM jobs. And that's where a lot of the jobs are coming from. Health and education alone are huge and growing sectors in the US. And so by my estimates, for every one job we're going to create in STEM between now and 2030, we're going to create three in HEAL jobs. But those jobs are at least as gender segregated as STEM jobs, but in the other direction. And unlike STEM, becoming more so over time. So if you look at the HEAL sector, only 24% of the workers in those sectors are male. And that number is falling. And in particular sectors, we're seeing a really precipitous drop in the number of men. We have a drop in the number of male teachers. We have a very sharp drop in the number of male psychologists. That's dropped from 39% male to 29% male in the last decade alone. And among psychologists under the age of 30, only 5% are male. So we roll that forward and we're going to see psychology becoming essentially almost an all-female profession. So these jobs, which are both crucial, I think, for society and where it would be very useful to have more diversity, are actually becoming more gender segregated. And so we have absolutely no effort to get more men into HEAL jobs, which is where I think the future lies and where we should be helping men to move. One of the problems that we face is what I call in the book a dad deficit. And that can be seen in various different ways. So one in four fathers don't live with their children. If parents split up, they're much more likely to lose contact with their fathers and with their mothers. And so one in three children, if their parents split up, don't see their father at all after a few years post the separation. So this fatherlessness is something that's very, very specific. And when four in ten children are born outside marriage and most children to less educated parents are born outside marriage, then we have to reinvent what it means to be a father, because right now men are still being held to an old standard of what it meant to be a successful father. In a world where that is neither possible for many of them or even desirable, because what we've seen is as women have grown in economic power and economic independence, then of course they're going to choose to be with a man rather than being forced to, as in the old days. This is probably the greatest liberation in human history, honestly, that women can now choose whether to be with a man or not. More than two out of five households in the US now, a woman is the main breadwinner. 40% of American women earn more than the average man. These are huge economic changes and all for the good. But it does pose some really sharp questions about what fathers are for. And until we escape the obsolete model of the breadwinner father, then we will continue to see more and more men being left out of family life. And the kicker is that boys in families that don't have a father presence suffer much more than girls. And so then what happens is that male disadvantage can become intergenerational, because if the fathers are struggling and therefore not really involved in their kids' lives, then the boys are the ones who suffer most, who will then go on to struggle themselves in education and the labor market. It's clear by now that marriage and social institutions and a sense of purpose matter to men. And so as we've seen these real challenges faced by men in education, work and family, you're seeing some really difficult and troubling health consequences. And so the so-called deaths of despair from suicide, overdose or alcohol, three times higher among men than among women. Suicide itself, three times higher among men and women and rising very quickly, especially among middle-aged men and younger men. So we can see these as symptoms, I think, of a broader malaise, which is what's troubling boys and men. And for men in particular, this sense of purpose is very important. I think it's a human universal that we need to be needed. There's a wonderful piece of work by an academic called Fiona Shand, who looked at the last words that men had used to describe themselves before committing suicide or attempting suicide. And the top of the list were worthless and useless. I think if we create a society in which so many men do feel like they're not needed, then it's no surprise that we see these deaths of despair, we see problems with opioids. Opioids are a much bigger problem for men than they are for women. And one of the great tragedies of opioid deaths is the death rates are higher in part because the users are on their own. And so in some ways, the opioid epidemic is a perfect illustration of a whole series of things we're talking about, which is a loss of role in the family, a loss of status in the labor market, turning to drugs and being isolated and withdrawn. And so in that example, I think you can see a symptom of this broader male malaise that we just need to take it more seriously. And we have a cultural responsibility as a society, men and women together, to help men and boys to adjust to this new world. Because right now, many of them are really struggling.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 2691\n","\n","Link  104 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/d6--QidPpfU\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/d6--QidPpfU\n","[youtube] d6--QidPpfU: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] d6--QidPpfU: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 3.69MiB in 00:53\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  There are so many interview questions that everyone is prepared for. Let me give you an example. What was a mistake you made in your previous job? A lot of candidates just aren't prepared and they won't have a good answer. So in most cases with better candidates, you're really just testing for prep. What does their prep look like? But if all you're doing is testing for prep, then all you're going to get are a bunch of conscientious people who are well prepared. For a lot of jobs, that's just great. It's fine. But for more creative jobs, you will be losing out on the bolder, more daring candidates who have other qualities because all you did was test for prep. For many jobs, great. For other jobs, that's terrible. Every potential interview question has pitfalls. There's no such thing as a list of the best interview questions. And if what you think interviewing is, well, here are the three perfect questions, I'm going to ask them to everyone in the same way, that is exactly not correct. How you get people into what I call the authenticity mode is going to depend a great deal on who they are and also who you are. If I'm interviewing a candidate, my favorite discussions are simply those that are unscripted. I prefer to have those conversations arise without me having to ask a question. I want them to be natural. I don't want it to feel threatening or high pressure. I just want us to start talking about something. I like the idea of changing interview venues when there's time. Get up, get a cup of coffee, go to another room. Hope some kind of decision arises spontaneously and you see how the candidate meets and makes that decision. You want to watch how candidates talk to other people, not just the person interviewing them. So I like spontaneity. Exactly how to achieve that will depend on the context, the job, how much time you have and many other things. But you would like some sense of how they perceive the social hierarchies around them, how they feel they fit into those hierarchies, how ambitious they are, how they think about their roles in teams, and any way that you can get the person talking about a topic where those issues come up. But I think it's important not to obsess on your favorite pet question and getting your favorite pet answer. You just want to see how the candidates process ideas. How do they think? How do they value? How do they treat other people? How do they talk about their relationships with other people? Those are the places in an interview where I like to be. There's one estimate that suggests somewhere between 20 and 40 percent of American economic growth since the 1960s has come about from allocating talent better. If we had fresher and more creative interview processes, I do think people would be more thoughtful, they would think more deeply about the jobs they're about to take, think we would spot talent we're not currently seeing, we would elevate more people into greater opportunity. Should we really be so arrogant and so conceited as to think we've now mastered this art and no further progress is possible? Of course not. That's why I think the key is not here's the three questions that tell you everything, but a general commitment to being trustworthy, authentic, trying to draw out the authenticity of the other person, and getting into the conversational mode. And a way to make progress on that is to seem trustworthy by actually being trustworthy. Because one thing human beings are great at is sniffing out hypocrisy in the people they're speaking to. So for you as an interviewer to actually be trustworthy is one of the highest value things you can be and do. And if there's a single piece of advice I would give that is pretty much robust across all situations, it would be that one. Get smarter, faster with videos from the world's biggest thinkers.

And the reason why is if you look at a lot of the innovations and breakthroughs today and you trace them back, as I did in my research, to their origin, a lot of times what you find at the root of it all is a great question, a beautiful question. A great definition I saw for questioning is that questioning enables us to organize our thinking around what we don't know. So in a time when so much knowledge is all around us, answers are at our fingertips, we really need great questions in order to be able to know what to do with all that information and find our way to the next answer. The real joy for me is that I can take things that are already familiar to you and by sharing the story of how I've learned to look at them, you can see those things you've been seeing a little differently. So I talk about curiosity-driven research as questions that we try to answer, why is that tree growing successfully in that place but never in that place? It's a curiosity question. It's the kind of question a little kid could come up with. Why don't we have those trees at our house? Now buried in the answer might be something that could give us better fruit someday that we can sell in the marketplace and feed hungry people with. But that result, that application to growing food for people is buried several steps below that answer. My part of that is to look at that first answer. What is that tree? What does it do? Why is it there? And we call that the curiosity-driven piece because that answer will be basically turned over to other experts who know how that might play out into something that is important for the marketplace. But there's no substitute for that first step, for that little kid question. The research, a four-year-old girl is asking as much as 300 questions a day. And when kids go into school you see this steady decline that happens as they go through the grade levels to the point where questioning in schools by junior high school is almost at zero. There are a lot of reasons why questioning declines as we get older. But one of the key issues is that in schools we really value the answers and there is almost no value placed on asking a good question. In fact the teachers now are so stressed to teach to the test and to cover so much material that they really can't even entertain a lot of questions even if they want to. So it becomes a real problem in our school system, in our education system. I think people are starting to address it, try to deal with it. In my research I found a number of teachers, schools that are trying to place more emphasis on questioning. I often start any project by asking a naive question. So naive that most likely you ask these sorts of questions when you were a child but at a certain age you learn that these were not appropriate. Or even if you ask them to yourself you never really followed through to try to see what would happen if you were to do something that was kind of patently absurd. But we can still for our own sake, the back of our mind, ask those sorts of questions and let them play out. We can fully develop them. And even if it's only in our own mind that we are fully developing them that process can take us to something that is more concrete, something that is more actionable in an adult responsible world that we don't really need to say we came to it through that naive question. You know someone asking why isn't someone doing this? What if someone tried to do that? So I found that questions are often at the root of innovation. And that's why in Silicon Valley these days they're actually saying questions are the new answers. But at the same time it's important to note that questions aren't just important to innovators or tech people. They're a survival skill for all of us. And that becomes even more true in a time of dynamic change. I mean we've got so much that we have to adapt to. We have to solve problems. We have to deal with change, uncertainty. And questioning is the tool that or one of the primary tools that lets you do that. We are social creatures, hierarchical creatures, and we don't want to shame ourselves, humiliate ourselves. But recognizing that by zigging when everyone else is zagging with that particular context you can actually develop a superpower. And that is asking dumb questions. And this came up repeatedly when I was interviewing incredible performers, world class performers meaning investors, entrepreneurs, writers, you name it, for Tools of Titans, the new book. And asking dumb questions can take many forms. I'll give you a few examples. Malcolm Gladwell is very good at asking so-called dumb questions. And you learn that from his father who was a mathematician, had no intellectual insecurities whatsoever, just did not care about looking stupid. And he would constantly ask or he would first say, I don't understand. Please explain that. I don't understand. Can you explain that? I don't understand. Can you explain that? And he would literally – he might ask that ten times in a row. If you look across all of the icons, titans, world class performers that I've interviewed in the say wealthy section, if we're dividing them into healthy, wealthy, and wise, if we look at the business side of things, one of the most common patterns that you spot is absurd questions. And the power of the absurd question is really something that I've paid a lot of attention to in the last few years. Those types of questions I think are – whether it's 10X thinking, 100X, however you frame that, it could also be a constraint. For instance, if you had to accomplish all of your work or grow your company 2X while working two hours a week, if you had a gun against your head, how would you attempt to do that? These type of absurd questions don't allow you to use your default frameworks for solutions. They don't allow you to use your base of current assumptions to come up with answers. It forces you to think laterally, it forces you to break some of the boundaries on the sphere of comfort that you've created for yourself. And that is what makes them I think in a way so powerful. And these are not questions by the way I think are valuable if you ponder them for 10 seconds and go hmm, yeah, maybe I would do this and then move on with your day. I think that journaling as an adjunct to asking these questions is very, very important. So I will sit down very often in the morning. One of my rituals also borrowed from a lot of these people is morning journaling of some type and I tend to use either morning pages, five minute journal or just a separate type of freehand sort of goal dissection and this would be a case where I would ask one of those questions and I would write freehand for say three pages, three to five pages and drink some tea as I'm doing it. And that is when you will not only come up with interesting ideas and there might be 90% garbage but if you have 10% that leads you in an interesting direction that could completely revolutionize your business or your life if you take that seed and do something with it. And that's been the case for me for a very long time. The asking of dumb questions can certainly apply to exploring any topic or interviewing. So Alex Bloomberg, who is co-founder of Gimlet Media which has a slew of gigantic podcast hits, just a factory for podcast blockbusters, he was the co-creator of PLANET MONEY which is a very successful radio and podcast show. And for instance during the subprime economic crisis he asked the question that no one else seemed to be asking but it was just sitting right in front of millions of people who couldn't quite figure out what the hell happened. And it was why would banks lend money to people who stand next to no chance of paying it back? And so very often the dumb question that is sitting right there that no one seems to be asking is the smartest question you can ask. Not only is it the smartest, most incisive, but if you want to ask it and you're reasonably smart I guarantee you there are other people who want to ask, they're just embarrassed to do so. And in this case if you can override that embarrassment and be the one who asks dumb questions you can end up having bestselling books. You can end up having a huge blockbuster of a podcast or many. You could end up picking the next Uber. It is a superpower. In a world that is governed by shame and perhaps political correctness more and more so people are not saying what's on their mind, they're not asking what's on their mind. The questions here are the most powerful.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1626\n","\n","Link  106 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/XovfK-IGbtw\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/XovfK-IGbtw\n","[youtube] XovfK-IGbtw: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] XovfK-IGbtw: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 4.68MiB in 01:12\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  In principle, what we are is just a big collection of elementary particles. And yes, it's really complicated. And no one in their right mind would try to describe a human being in terms of those elementary particles. But particle physicists have collected elementary particles in what's called the standard model of particle physics. And those particles, for all we currently know, make up everything around us, the entire universe, including us. Now, a lot of people seem to be a little bit uncomfortable with this. They are wondering, isn't there something more about me? Am I not a little bit more than just those fundamental particles? Where does my consciousness come from? Whatever happened to my soul? Personally, I don't think that to describe our observations, our experience of us thinking requires anything more than particle physics. I'm happy to leave the understanding of consciousness to neurobiologists or whatever those fields are called. But I also don't think that we need to add anything to the fundamental laws of nature that we have collected in physics. I think it's sufficient. But a lot of people have a difficulty with that. They want there to be something else, this thing that they call the soul. So one possible route that you can take is what's called dualism that just says we have all those fundamental particles and atoms and gravity and interactions and all that kind of stuff. And on the other side, we have the soul, and it just lives in an entirely non-physical realm. And this is where I reside in some sense. And this is perfectly fine. It's compatible with all we know, so long as this soul does not interact with the physical side, because once it starts interacting with it, they would have to be part of our theories in the foundations of physics. So for all we currently know from the foundations of physics, everything that isn't in the standard model of particle physics plus gravity is emergent from those particles and the forces between them. And by emergent, I just mean that it can be reduced to the properties of those fundamental particles, like the color of a metal or something like this. And this is something that is known under the word reductionism. There's no observation that we have ever made that contradicts this idea of reductionism, that fundamentally everything is made of and everything derives from the properties of those fundamental particles. But there are properties of collective assemblies of particles that, in principle, we could calculate. In most cases, we cannot. There are certainly no particle physicists who can calculate what your eye color will be if you give them the properties of all the particles in your body. But in principle, you know, it should be possible. If you had a big enough computer, you would be able to calculate it. So on some level, you could say that, yeah, we are really just constituted of all those elementary particles. And all that we can do comes about from the interaction of those particles. Even though that might be an entirely useless description of us, it's nevertheless correct. But I think that actually we're much more than that. On a different level, you could say we're somewhat less than that, by which I mean that what's important about us is not the particles that we are made of. It's what those particles can do. And that's what's contained in the information of how those particles are put together, that they make up a human body, someone who can walk and talk and think and write books or fly to the moon. Where does this come from? Well, it comes from the way that those atoms are arranged. And I actually think that this is a very hopeful message because it means that in principle, it should be possible to upload your identity and actually not just your thinking apparatus, but your entire body to a computer because there's nothing that stands in the way. All this information about the configuration of the atoms in your body, well, you can formulate it in mathematics and put it onto a computer.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 700\n","\n","Link  107 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/DcIgk94Fp6Y\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/DcIgk94Fp6Y\n","[youtube] DcIgk94Fp6Y: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] DcIgk94Fp6Y: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 4.59MiB in 01:29\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  We all exist in this world where we can tweet at somebody or engage with somebody, could even be the President of the United States, and they might react to us back. Social media has thrust us all onto the head of a pin, socially speaking, existentially speaking. Even if they're on the other side of the planet, even if they have a lot more money than we do, we can still interact with them, we can still compete with them on engagement. They're inside of our world. We have a mimetic machine in our pocket where all of these people exist. So, what is mimetic desire? Mimetic desire means that we're adopting another person's desire as our own, usually without even realizing that we're doing it. So, social media has given us millions of mimetic models that we now have to contend with. Some people have went from having 10 mimetic models to now having a million, and we haven't quite come to grips as a culture with what that means for our mental and emotional health. There are two kinds of mimetic models. The first kind is called an external mediator of desire. These are models that are outside of our world. Whether because they exist in a different social sphere than we do, there's no possibility of us coming into contact with them and certainly not becoming rivals with them. They're in some sense outside of our world of desire, outside of our world of competition. Now, these external models of desire can be real or they can be fictional. The other kind of model is inside of our world called internal mediators of desire. These are people that we do come into contact with, and there is a possibility of conflict or rivalry with these people. These are people that are in our family. These are people in our workplace. These are people that could even be our friends. It's easier to compare ourselves to them. These are the kinds of people that we look to as benchmarks, and we're far more likely to be envious of somebody that we went to high school with who now has a great job and a beautiful spouse than we are to be envious of the richest person in the world. The danger with external mediators of desire, with keeping up with people that are very successful, with people that have modeled a certain kind of lifestyle, is that there's no end to that process. All desire is a form of transcendence. We desire to go beyond the boundaries, to go just over the mountain, to be the kind of person that we don't feel that we currently are. Having positive models of desire to emulate is a very good thing. It's important to have people that model virtues and goodness that we would like. But we have to understand the limitations of any model, and understanding how the dynamic between us and our models changes in that scenario is really, really important. It's also important to understand when somebody is an internal model of desire to us, because in that case, we have to have boundaries. All desire comes from us feeling like we lack something, and that can bring us into a dangerous, vicious cycle, because there will always be another model to find. We have to choose our models wisely. We also have to know when the model is inflaming us with a desire for something that's going to bring real fulfillment, or whether it's going to bring a dopamine hit or allow us to fantasize about a life that we'll probably never have, and even if we did have it, it would probably make us miserable. All you need to do is go on Instagram and spend five minutes, and you see lifestyles modeled. You see vacation destinations modeled, fashions, manners of speech, ways of engagement, ways of speaking, political preferences. All of these desires are modeled for us 24 hours a day, billions of them, and we need to understand the mimetic landscape of social media, or else we'll become totally controlled by it.

Many people think that mindfulness is a spiritual thing, many think that it's a private thing that we do at home. And most people think that mindfulness is about slowing down. That's wrong. Mindfulness in short terms is really about speeding up our mental processes whereby we can be more effective with whatever we are doing, that we have this attentional muscle that allows us really to be on task with what we are doing. Research shows that our mind actually wanders about 50% of the time. And research also shows that when our mind is wandering, we are never as happy as when our mind is in the present moment. So if you're minding in the future worrying about something that's going to happen or in the past because you're regretting something or angry at somebody, you're more likely to feel more negative emotions. But when you're in the present moment, even if you're doing a task you don't particularly like, you'll actually feel happier. But also what we know is that you'll be able to be more productive when you're in that state because you're going to naturally be focused. People misunderstand meditation as, oh, I just sweep all my thoughts away and then I'm in this like nirvana. What you'll get by trying to sweep all your thoughts away is a headache at the most because there's no way to sweep your thoughts away. They will get you every time. And then you can have millions of thoughts about mindfulness and meditation and those are just thoughts too. They're not meditating. But when you see that you're not your thoughts then you can watch them in this kind of impersonal, more sort of, if you will, observing way with kindness, with self-compassion because a lot of them are heavily loaded with negative emotion. And you can see that if you don't touch them, if you don't do anything with them, if you don't get caught in them they self-liberate naturally in awareness. The awareness is like touching a soap bubble. You know it's fun for kids and fun for adults too. Soap bubble and you touch it and it just goes poof. So I love that image. The thought is the soap bubble and the emotion too that's valancing the thought. And you don't need to do anything with it because your awareness is like it's not even a finger. It's not corporeal. The awareness, just the embracing of it or the arising of it like in the sky it goes poof-al by itself. And don't take my word for it. This is something that when you sit down and you begin to watch you'll see this is not rocket science. You don't have to sit in a cave for 30 years to have that kind of experience. All you need to do is in some sense get out of your own way. Now I'm not saying that's easy. That's really hard. But if you can have moments when you get out of your own way then you'll see that a lot of the stuff that we get so caught up in it's like it's a mirage. There are features of our experience that we don't notice when we're lost in thought. So for instance every experience you've ever had, every emotion, the anger you felt yesterday or a year ago isn't here anymore. It arises and it passes away. And if it comes back in the present moment by virtue of your thinking about it again it will subside again when you're no longer thinking about it. Now this is something that people tend not to notice because we rather than merely feel an emotion like anger we spend our time thinking of all the reasons why we have every right to be angry. And so the conversation keeps this emotion in play for much, much longer than its kind of natural half-life. And if you're able through mindfulness to interrupt this conversation and simply witness the feeling of anger as it arises you'll find that you can't be angry for more than a few moments at a time. If you think you can be angry for a day or even an hour without continually manufacturing this emotion by thinking without knowing that you're thinking you're mistaken. And this is something you can just witness for yourself. This is again this is an objective truth claim about the nature of subjective experience and it's testable. And mindfulness is the tool that you would use to test it. Mindfulness allows us to shift our relationship to our experience. Instead of getting sucked into our emotions or our thoughts which is what happens when we're depressed or anxious we see them as those thoughts again or those feelings again and that disempowers them. There's actually research at UCLA that shows when you can name that feeling oh I'm feeling depressed again you have shifted the activity levels neurologically in the part of the brain which is depressed to the part of the brain which notices which is aware the prefrontal cortex and that diminishes the depression and enhances your ability to be able to understand it or to see it as just a feeling. Meditation practices can really help you observe your mind become aware of its tendencies for example its tendency to wander and help you through that awareness shift your attention back into the present moment. Meditation is an exercise in which you are engaging fully with the present moment. So it's a fantastic way to train your mind to be more present with what is going on right now. When you start to watch the mind you'll notice that it's got a lot of agendas on the greed spectrum. I mean it's and greed is not quite the same as ambition. It has to do with greed has to do with more for me. More of what I want for me. Then there's this other thing that you'll also notice which is you're sitting there and the opposite will come up. What I don't want. What I'm afraid of. What I need to keep at the door. Keep at bay. To push away. And that's collectively referred to as aversion. So we've got greed on the one hand and it is toxic. The more you're sucked into greed the more egotistical you become the more it's all about me the more you're willing to sort of lose your own ethical foundation to get a particular result only to find that even that results not really satisfying so you're on to the next result and it's a never ending trajectory. But nevertheless we have to admit it's here all the time. It's not like oh I've transcended greed. I don't think we do transcend greed but we can transform how we are in relationship to it and with awareness the greed doesn't have to run us. So we can bring mindfulness to greed and the greed can be attenuated or liberated. Mindfulness to aversion and the aversion could be attenuated or liberated or mindfulness to our own deluded nature thoughts and emotions and so forth and that is liberating of them. Then what do you have left? You as pure awareness. Fully embodied. What comes next? I don't know you're writing the script. It's not like oh then you'll feel this and you'll feel that and you'll be enlightened and everybody will bow down to you and you know you won't ever have to have any kind of challenges or difficulty. The full catastrophe will evaporate forever. No. It'll be the same old same old only. You won't be the same old same old because you'll be the same you. You'll have the same bank account. You'll have the same social security number. You'll have the same face in the mirror. It'll be aging every day but you will be in wiser relationship to your possibilities. The enemy of mindfulness and really of any meditation practice is being lost in thought. It's to be thinking without knowing that you're thinking. Now the problem is not thoughts themselves. We need to think. We need to think to do almost anything that makes us human to reason to plan to have social relationships to do science. Thinking is indispensable to us but most of us spend every moment of our waking lives thinking without knowing that we're thinking. And this automaticity is a kind of scrim thrown over the present moment through which we view everything and it's distorting of our lives. It's distorting of our emotions. It engineers our unhappiness in every moment because most of what we think is quite unpleasant. We're judging ourselves, we're judging others, we're worrying about the future, we're regretting the past. We're at war with our experience in subtle or coarse ways and much of this self-talk is unpleasant and diminishing our happiness in every moment. And so meditation is a tool for cutting through that. It's interrupting this continuous conversation we're having with ourselves. If you do mindfulness practice 10 minutes a day or 10 minutes three times over the course of a day something remarkable happens to your attention. And that's the fact that it has to do with the fact that we're all multitasking these days. You know, people on average look at their email about 50 times a day. They look at their Facebook 20-some times a day. And that's just the tip of the iceberg. There's Instagram. There's your phone calls. There's whatever it is you have to do. And what this means for attention is that we're challenged, that focused attention is an endangered species. What happens with attention is it either goes to the highest opportunity or it goes to the highest threat that we perceive in our environment. So suddenly there is something that we, you know, in the hunter-gather time, something that was valuable to eat and then that's where our attention goes. Or there's something like a dark shadow moving and then that's where our attention goes. And it's automatic. And the reason that we have attention is to pay attention and then summon all of our resources to either take advantage of the opportunity or to avoid the threat. That's really the purpose of attention. So we zone out everything else. We kind of blank everything and just focus on one thing that in that particular moment is of highest value or potentially the highest threat. There is so much happening in our lives that we pay attention to and quite frankly, you know, the little devices that we carry around don't help very much because our attention gets totally absorbed into that attraction from these little devices. And we get a little bit of dopamine all the time when we get, oh, information. Information is valuable instinctively. So we want to know what's happening and what's going on and it's true for gossip and it's true for why we watch the news. But the problem is that our attention is so much absorbed in that that we rarely, if ever, pay attention to just being present. And that is really what mindfulness and meditation is trying to balance out a little bit so that when the mind quiets and you actually are at home in your body, that that distraction fades away and you actually get in touch with that underlying happiness that the Greeks call eudaimonia. Research shows that people who meditate can increase their attention span. In fact, in some research studies, we use a task called the attentional blink task in which you show people a number of different images in very fast sequence. And usually we would only pick up every fourth image. We don't actually see the others. That's why we call it the attentional blink. So research has shown that after a meditation retreat, people tend to not show that attentional blink or to show it less, which is very interesting. It means that if we calm our mind, we're somehow able to pick up things better in our environment, which also makes sense in terms of how divided our mind is with regards to multitasking and so forth. When our mind is very settled, then we're able to literally see more things, register more. There was also a study out of Yale that looked at what's called the default mode network of the brain. It's a connected series of brain regions that are active during most of our waking hours when we're doing that thing that human beings do all the time, which is obsessing about ourselves, thinking about the past, thinking about the future, doing anything but being focused on what's happening right now. Meditators not only turn off the default mode network of their brain while they're meditating, but even when they're not meditating. In other words, meditators are setting a new default mode. And what's that default mode? They're focused on what's happening right now. We know a lot about or we're growing our knowledge about the effects of meditation, long-term meditation in people like monks that meditate for 50 or 50,000 hours in their lifetime. And we know that this completely changes the electrophysiological responses of their brains. They have much higher levels of what we call gamma waves, which is a particular frequency of wave. All of us get gamma for a very short period when we solve a problem we've been grappling with, even if it's something that's vexed us for months. We get about a half second of gamma. It's the strongest wave in the EEG spectrum. We get it when we bite into an apple or imagine biting into an apple. And for a brief period, a split second, inputs from taste, sound, smell, vision, all of that come together in that imagined bite into the apple. But that last very, very short period in an ordinary EEG, what was stunning was that the Olympic-level meditators—these are people who've done up to 62,000 lifetime hours of meditation—their brain wave shows gamma very strong all the time as a lasting trait, just no matter what they're doing. It's not a state effect. It's not during their meditation alone, but it's just their everyday state of mind. We actually have no idea what that means experientially. Science has never seen it before. We also find that in these Olympic-level meditators, when we ask them, for example, to do a meditation, a meditation on compassion, their level of gamma jumps seven to 800 percent in a few seconds. This has also never been seen by science. So we have to assume that the special state of consciousness that you see in the highest level meditators is a lot like something described in the classical meditation literature centuries ago, which is that there is a state of being which is not like our ordinary state. Sometimes it's called liberation, enlightenment, awake. Whatever the word may be, we suspect there's really no vocabulary that captures what that might be. The people that we've talked to in this Olympic-level group say it's a very spacious sense. You're wide open. You're prepared for whatever may come. There's no way a fidgety and skeptical news anchor would ever have started meditating were it not for the science. The science is really compelling. It shows that meditation can boost your immune system, lower your blood pressure, help you deal with problems ranging from irritable bowel syndrome to psoriasis. And the neuroscience is where it really gets sci-fi. There was a study out of Harvard that shows that short daily doses of meditation can literally grow the gray matter in key areas of your brain having to do with self-awareness and compassion and shrink the gray matter in the area associated with stress. Beginners in mindfulness or other meditations, it turns out, right from the get-go have a better reaction to stress. What that means is that, and we see this in brain function, the area of the brain which reacts to stress called the amygdala. It's the trigger point for the fight or flight or freeze response. It's what makes us angry all of a sudden or anxious all of a sudden. The amygdala is quieter. It's calmer in the face of stress. And this lets us be calmer in the face of stress. This is another benefit that we see right from the beginning. We all need a peace of mind. So the peace of mind comes from the mindfulness, through that we understand how important kindness and compassion, one mental good quality, lead into the next and the next and the next. Life is not perfect. Life never be perfect. How much we put into effort. To be perfect is not perfect everything. We are human. Patient is wonderful to have. So if that day is somebody who in your life, if he or she is so stressful, and at that time sometimes not necessarily there's not much room for communication, just be patient. Just be... As a human being, we all need that kind of quality. But yet again, the seeds, we all have that. We all have a patience. How much we call an impatient person, he or she has a seeds of the patience and the kindness and the compassion. All of these seeds, we didn't have to buy anywhere. We have that. We all have a room to grow, but we all have a seeds. One of the most important things, whether you're looking in the Christian literature or the Buddhist literature or Jewish literature or Hindu literature, it doesn't matter. All of the meditative traditions within those classical schools of thought are saying the most important thing is that you become less focused on yourself, caring only about yourself, less selfish as it were, and more open to the needs of others, more compassionate, more caring, more present to other people. If you look at longer term meditators, people who've done more than say one or two thousand hours of meditation over their entire life, and this happens naturally, let's say you do a half hour sit every morning before you go out for the day, well after a decade or two it does add up. And it seems that that cumulative amount does make people less selfish, less just caring about me and more open to other people around them, more caring, more able to tune in, more able to empathize. This also shows up in a brain change which we think is quite significant, which is that the nucleus accumbens, which is the focus of craving, of I've got to have that. Drug addiction, for example, actually becomes smaller in longer term meditators. This seems to be related to this lack of I, me, mine in how people behave and how they think in their emotional life. And we see it most strikingly, of course, in Olympic level meditators where these are people who have done 10,000 or more, 10,000, 62,000 hours of meditation. And they are genuinely selfless people but they're very nourishing, very enjoyable to be with because they pay attention to you. They really focus on the person they're with and how they can be of service. So what do you need now? It's very refreshing. How do you get to be a regular meditator? And the answer is I think start very, very small. I know for myself I have a subchapter in my book called Confessions of a Yo-Yo Meditator because I think I have tried all different kinds of meditation. And my big mistake early on was to try and meditate for too long at a sitting. So I would try and meditate for 20, 25 minutes with no meditation experience. And it was a disaster. I forced myself to do it for 30 days thinking that that would be it and I would form my habit and day 31 I took a little break and I never came back. But then when I came back again starting very, very small with things that I can just do on my own, just breathing meditation, focusing on the breath, something that we all do at the end of yoga classes. That's what really kind of helped me build my muscle. And I just had to stick with that very short meditation and build it up that way. And I think people too often either start too long or don't stick with it enough. But again shorter is better. My powers of prognostication are not great. I bought a lot of stock in the company that made Palm Pilot back in 2000 and that didn't go so well for me. But having said that I'm going to make a prediction. I think we're looking at meditation as the next big public health revolution. In the 1940s if you told people that you went running they would say, who's chasing you? Right now if you tell people you meditate and I have a lot of experience with telling people this, they're going to look at you like you're a little weird most of the time. That's going to change. Meditation is going to join the pantheon of no brainers like exercise, brushing your teeth and taking the meds that your doctor prescribes to you. These are all things that if you don't do you feel guilty about. And that is where I think we're heading with meditation because the science is so strongly suggestive that meditation can do really, really great things for your brain and for your body. This is a technique that fleshes our thoughts out. If you have a song going through your head over and over or if you're reliving an argument you had with someone a year ago, if you're obsessed over something that you can't get out of your head, this technique is good for that as well as just general meditation purposes. It doesn't have a name. I usually just refer to it as the prison cell meditation. But if you're interested I'll do that. Is that okay? You start by closing your eyes and then you envision yourself in a prison cell, standing in the center of a cell. Everything is white. The walls are white. The ceiling is white. The floors are white. The only thing there is in this cell other than you, on the back wall, is a slit of a window. And it's up so high that the only way that you can reach it, the only way you can see out of it, is by gripping the window ledge high above your head and hoisting yourself up by sheer brute physical upper body strength. Almost like you're doing a pull up or a chin up. So you want to bring as much tactile sensation to the visualization as you possibly can. You want to feel it as much as you can. So picture yourself walking to the back of this wall, pressing yourself against it, reaching up with your hands and gripping the edge of that window seal with your fingertips. Try to feel what the back wall of that prison cell would feel like pressed against the side of your face, pressed against your torso. Feel the coldness of it, the grittiness of it. And as you start to lift yourself up off the floor using just your arms, try to feel what that would actually feel like. Feel the muscles in your shoulders. Feel the muscles in your chest, in your abdomen firing, tensing as you're pulling yourself up. Try to feel what the wall would feel like as you scrape against it, lifting yourself slowly by sheer strength. As your eyes crest over the rim of the window, white light bursts through the window, floods through the window and obliterates everything. The cell, you, everything until there's only white light remaining. Do it again. Press yourself against the back of the wall, reach up with both hands and grip the edge of the window seal. Feel the muscles in your chest, in your abdomen, in your shoulders tensing as you start to lift yourself up. Feel the wall scrape against the front of your thighs, against the side of your face as you hoist yourself until your eyes go over the edge of the window frame and then white light comes flooding in through the window, obliterating everything. You, the cell, until there's only white light. Once more, feel yourself pressed against the wall, raise your arms, hook your fingertips over the window ledge. Begin to raise yourself slowly up by sheer strength, feeling the muscles in your shoulders, your chest, your torso straining as you lift your body weight. Feel the wall of the prison cell as you scrub against it and as your eyes go over the edge of the window frame, white light comes flooding in, obliterating everything. This is one of those things you can do for as long as you have time. You can do it five times, you can do it ten times, the longer you do it the more effective it is. It gives you something to work with in your visualization instead of just trying to stay in the present moment, which is really, really hard.

On the train, at home, the movies, out, in the bath. But no matter where I'm watching, I find myself constantly doing this one thing. I was active all of these past few months. What? I was active all of these past few months. I was active all of these past few months. I was active all of these past few months. It turns out this isn't unusual. We polled our YouTube audience and about 57% of people said that they feel like they can't understand the dialogue and the things that they watch unless they're using subtitles. But it feels like this hasn't always been the case. So to figure out what was going on, I made a call. Hi, my name is Austin Olivia Kendrick. I'm a professional dialogue editor for film and TV. I basically perform audio surgery on actors' words. Do you watch subtitles? I do, actually. I do a lot of the time. So why do you think that we all feel like we need subtitles now? I get asked this question all the time. All the time. It's something that is, it doesn't have a simple straightforward answer. It's very layered and very complex. And after talking to Austin for almost two hours, it's true. It's a very layered and complex topic. But everything kept pointing back to one main thing. Technology that got us from this. I'll get you my pretty. You should be kissed or not. No, Richard, no. What has happened to your life? To this. Mom, I just woke up. That'll still be my sympathy. You better put that down. Let's start with microphones. I'm going to use this clip from Singing in the Rain to show how mics used to work. Here's the mic. You talk towards it. The sound goes through the cable to the box. A man records it on a big record in wax. This scene illustrates some of the difficulties and intricacies of early sound recording. Mics were big, bulky, temperamental, and required creative solutions to be hidden. They were wired and recorded onto hard memory, like wax and eventually tape. No matter how many actors were in a scene, all sound got recorded to one track. So performers had to be diligently focused and facing a certain angle so that their words could be picked up. Otherwise... You couldn't hear a thing. But technology has improved to the point where microphones don't impede performance as much anymore. They've become better, smaller, wireless, and we use more of them to ensure that performances get captured. What we typically are working with from production dialogue is two boom microphones and then every actor has at least one lavalier microphone hidden somewhere on them. These shrinking mics have given actors the flexibility to be more naturalistic in their performances. They no longer need to project so that their words reach the mic. They can speak softly knowing that the tiny mic hidden on their body will pick up what they're saying. And my personal favorite example of this performance shift is Alec Baldwin on 30 Rock. In a 2011 speech slash roast, Tina Fey says that he speaks so quietly that she can't hear him when she's standing next to him. And then you play the film back and it's there somehow. Just listen to this whisper off between him and Will Arnett. I'm not afraid of you. Yeah. Well, you should be. Let's just see how it all shakes out in the meeting. Naturalism isn't always the best for intelligibility though. Take Tom Hardy, an actor that I personally love but who famously is a mumbler. Her ass is still be flunking around in the surrey right now if it wasn't for me. I mean, the mic picked that line up fine. Like we can definitely hear that he's talking. He's saying something. But once that mumble gets recorded, it's onto a dialogue editor's shoulder to make it as intelligible as possible. And that was a lot harder when everything was analog. While you could pick the best takes and physically spice them together, if some piece of dialogue was truly impossible to understand, then actors will come in and re-record those specific lines in a process called ADR, or automated dialogue replacement, which you can see Meryl Streep do in this scene from Postcards from the Edge. There's enough money in the world to further a cause like yours. That still gets done today, but... ADR also costs money because you're not only paying for the actor's time, you're paying for the engineer's time and then the editor's time. So we try to do ADR, frankly, as little as possible. And so a lot of her job is making words sound better. The show I'm currently working on, I remember in the middle of this one word there was just this loud metal clang that I couldn't remove. So I had to go in and I had to find an alternate take of it that fit, and then I had to fit it to the movement of her mouth in that moment and then push it in. And once she's done with it, it's sent off to a mixer, who works to make sure the frequencies of the sound effects and music don't overlap with the frequencies of the human voice. Something that's only possible now that the world has moved away from tape and into digital recordings. That is a big challenge, carving out those frequencies, that space amongst every other element of the mix for the dialogue to be able to punch through and not be all muddied up by any other sounds that exist in that band of frequencies. But even with all that work, lines of dialogue can still be hard to understand. The kind of feeling has been, if you want your movie to feel quote unquote cinematic, you have to have wall to wall bombastic, loud sound. A lot of people will ask, why don't you just turn the dialogue up? Just turn it up. And if only it was that simple. Because a big thing that we want to preserve is a concept called dynamic range. The range between your quietest sound and your loudest sound. If you have your dialogue that's going to be at the same volume as an explosion that immediately follows it, the explosion is not going to feel as big. You need that contrast in volume in order to give your ear a sense of scale. But the thing is, you can only make something so loud before it gets distorted. So if you want to create that wide dynamic range, you have no choice but to push those quieter sounds lower instead of pushing the louder sounds louder. So explosions go up and dialogue comes down. Which brings us to the Christopher Nolan of it all. A separate structure within the other standard. Nearly every film of his has been criticized for its hard to hear dialogue that essentially begs for subtitles. But as this headline explains, he likes it that way. According to an interview in a book called the Nolan Variations, he said that he gets a lot of complaints even from other filmmakers who would say, I just saw your film and the dialogue is inaudible. The truth was, it was kind of the whole enchilada of how we had chosen to mix it. And in a 2017 interview with IndieWire, he said, we made the decision a couple of films ago that we weren't going to mix films for substandard theaters. And this is kind of the crux of the matter. The content that we watch here and here and here is not mixed for us primarily. We're recording mixers mix for the widest surround sound format that is available, typically like big release films that is Dolby Atmos, which has true 3D sound up to 128 channels. The thing is, if you're not at a movie theater that can showcase the best sound Hollywood has to offer, you can't experience all of those channels. So after the movie is mixed for the 128 Atmos tracks, somebody has to create a separate version of the film's audio where all those same sounds live on one or two or five tracks. This is called down mixing. Down mixing is the process of taking that biggest mix and folding it down into formats with lesser channels available to it. So say Atmos down to 7.1 or 7.1 down to 5.1 or 5.1 down to stereo, stereo down to mono. Unlike old TVs that were gigantic and had a ton of space for speakers, TVs today are super thin. Like this one that I have in my living room is about the same thickness as my iPhone. So even though it's outputting the same mono or stereo sound that an older TV might, it's still going to sound worse because you have to have tiny little speakers to fit into this tiny sleek form factor. These tiny speakers are also usually on the back of the TV. So the down mix version of this movie that went from 128 channels down to just 2 is going to sound even muddier when it's pointing away from you. And when you're watching on your phone or a laptop, it's generally not much better. When you combine not great speakers, naturalistic mumbly performances, dynamic range featuring bombastic sounds over dialogue, and a flattened mix, it's no wonder we have trouble hearing what's going on. And it seems like the industry knows this because TVs today are shipping with all kinds of settings built in, like this intelligence mode. You can put on active voice amplification in hopes of making that dialogue track come through just a little bit clearer. But of course, that's more bandaid than it is solution. The way movies get mixed likely isn't going to revert back to super pristine dialogue. So the solutions we have are 1. buy better speakers and only go to theaters that have impeccable sound. 2. take a chill pill and try to just worry a little bit less about picking up every single word that gets said. Or 3. just keep the subtitles on. For people who are deaf or hard of hearing, subtitles make movies and TV shows accessible. And this accessibility has just expanded in recent years. Laws have been passed to ensure that movie theaters have at least a few screenings a week with captions. Pretty much every streaming service has standardized them, and speech recognition technology has made them accessible in pretty much every YouTube video and TikTok. Plus they're super easy to toggle on and off.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1804\n","\n","Link  110 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/RBVJ9o25pPM\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/RBVJ9o25pPM\n","[youtube] RBVJ9o25pPM: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] RBVJ9o25pPM: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 12.16MiB in 02:58\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  At first glance, Vox is an extraordinarily successful media organization. On YouTube alone, they have 11 million subscribers and over 3 billion views. And in the last 30 days itself, they've gained over 20 million views and over 100,000 subscribers. Given the high quality journalism and the documentaries that come out of Vox, it's not surprising that they're so successful. But what may be surprising is that there is a large community that can't stand Vox. They believe that Vox skews perspectives and that much of their content centers around garnering attention as opposed to truly informing. It's not just some viewers that are put off by their content either, many journalists are as well. Just one Google search will bring up dozens of opinion pieces trashing on Vox. But much of this, you can just write off as natural criticism. Whenever an organization gets relatively large, it's gonna attract detractors regardless of what they do. But something that you can't write off as simply is the exodus at Vox. Johnny Harris is likely the most notable example, but he's by no means the only one. Another Vox journalist turned YouTuber is Cleo Abram. And it's not just journalists who are leaving Vox either. This exodus actually goes all the way to the top. In just the last few years, 2 out of the 3 Vox founders left the company. And it's not like these guys completely quit journalism or the media industry altogether. They just quit Vox. Matthew Iglesias for example left so that he could become a writer at a paid newsletter called Substack. Similarly, Ezra Klein left Vox to become a notable journalist at the New York Times. Yet another executive who ditched Vox is Lauren Williams. While she wasn't a co-founder, she did serve as editor-in-chief and senior vice president. To make things worse, all 3 of these departures happened in the same month, November of 2020. There's also a good chance that Vox is dealing with some financial challenges throughout this recession given that they laid off 39 people last year. So what happened to Vox? Taking a look back, Ezra Klein wasn't always looking to ditch Vox. In fact, not too long ago, he was looking to ditch the Washington Post. Ezra was the head of a public policy blog where he regularly analyzed and discussed upcoming legislation and the political landscape. While this was a pretty safe position to be in, Ezra felt the need to address a shortfall within the market. He felt that the traditional media outlets weren't providing in-depth explanatory journalism. His first instinct was to pitch the idea to upper management. But after they rejected his idea, it didn't take him long to leave and he took several Washington Post employees with him, including one of Vox's other co-founders, Melissa Bell. Together, they hired a team of 20 people, each of whom were an expert in a given topic area. And shortly after, they launched Vox on April 6th, 2014 with the goal of making the news exciting again. Their initial content focused on explaining various facets of the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare. They also spent time exploring economic issues like the massive public debt. These articles and videos performed quite well, especially for a brand new media organization. But it would take Vox a few months to really trigger the YouTube algorithm, which brings us to their first viral hit, Three Big Reasons War Is Going Away. They followed this up with yet another viral hit just a few weeks later titled, Weed Is Not More Dangerous Than Alcohol. Pretty quickly, Vox started to build a name for themselves as the edgy media outlet that wasn't afraid to make their positions clear. I mean, they were literally claiming that the US debt wasn't a big deal and that weed should not be ostracized. They even had videos comparing Bitcoin to the internet and debunking Shark Week. While many of these were great one-off videos, Vox was yet to find a core series that people would tune in for. But this would change on July 23rd, 2014 when Vox posted a video called, What Made North Korea So Bizarre? Vice had already popularized the elusive nature of North Korea across YouTube. So when Vox posted a video about North Korea, it instantly went viral. And since then, North Korea based content has become a staple on the channel, garnering tens of millions of views. It looks like this is one of the things that Johnny Harris took with him from Vox as he has his own multi-million view North Korea video. Speaking of Johnny Harris, he was an early employee at Vox having joined in 2014 as a senior video producer. Aside from producing videos about North Korea, Johnny worked on producing map-based videos. Eventually, Johnny would merge the elusive aspect of North Korea with the geographical aspect of maps. And the combination of these two sides would lead to the creation of one of Vox's most popular docu-series of all time, Borders, which brings us into the glory days of Vox. In the late 2010s, Vox was killing it. If you go to their channel and sort by most popular, you'll see that virtually all of their most popular videos were posted during this time period. Not only did they have deep, thought-provoking content about various hot topics, but they delivered said content in an exceptional way. This is something that hasn't changed at Vox to this day. The quality of their animations, infographics, and editing is top-notch for YouTube, and honestly, it's better than even most traditional media outlets. You could say that Vox had achieved their goal of making informative videos not just watchable or informative, but full-on entertaining. With every video, there was a beginning, middle, and end, with main characters, failures, and successes. Each video was a story, a journey through a specific topic or historical event. Something that made Vox even more popular was the downfall of cable TV. More and more people were switching completely to streaming platforms like Netflix and Hulu. But while these platforms had super exciting shows and long-form documentaries, something that they lacked was news-based content. And all of this combined led to the extraordinary rise of what we all know as Vox today. But wait a minute, where's the bad stuff? If Vox was producing such great content, why do a large portion of viewers and journalists hate Vox? And why are leading hosts and even founders leaving the company? Well, the answer is that, like Vox, I've only been telling one side of the story. Throughout this entire journey, Vox had another side that was not nearly as respected. And I think the best way to explain this other side is as the Buzzfeed side. If you're not familiar with Buzzfeed, they're another popular media company that gained much of their fame during the same time period as Vox. Instead of focusing on news-based content though, Buzzfeed focused on entertainment and experiences, and they were infamous for their clickbait BS articles. Here's a few just to give you an idea. I cannot believe the haircut Grimes just gave her and Elon Musk's baby. Ten signs that your cat is a wizard. Which ousted Arab Spring ruler are you? Given that Vox was in a much more serious informative niche, you would think that they would be above such articles. But they weren't. Who is Solange and why is she attacking Jay-Z? Jay-Z called LaCrosse soft. The research literature disagrees. The time when hip-hop's top drag queen met RuPaul. In many of these cases, the writers knew that the articles were ridiculous. But they posted them anyway because they also knew that they could leverage the celebrities and their drama. While these articles may have gotten clicks, they took away from Vox's credibility as the informative and reputable digital media organization. In the grand scheme of things though, this was by far their smallest offense. The real critique of Vox is that they tell one side of stories. I didn't want to make this video political, but that's impossible to achieve when Vox themselves is so political. Basically every video they post has an underlying liberal agenda and this dates back to their very first videos. Or Obamacare will change health insurance forever. Competent women are getting bypassed by overconfident men. Weed is not more dangerous than alcohol. I'm not suggesting that any of these stances are right or wrong, but simply that they only cover one side of the story. This doesn't just stop at the headlines or thumbnails either. Basically every word and every sentence in the video is carefully concocted to make you think a certain way. Even in reality, real journalism should focus on providing an objective view of all perspectives. I mean this is one of the biggest problems with traditional media as well. You've got your liberal outlets like CNN, the New York Times, and NBC. And you've got your conservative outlets like Fox, the New York Post, and Newsmax. Given that one of Vox's goals was to make up for the shortfalls of legacy media, you would think that they would've spent a lot of effort in gathering and conveying diverse viewpoints. And instead, it seems like Vox has simply become a traditional media outlet that's good at social media and the internet. But despite the new medium, Vox has all of the same issues as traditional media. And it's not just liberal viewpoints that they support either. They even go as far as defending people from the left. One of the best examples of this is with a journalist named Sarah Xiong. In 2019, Sarah made the following remarks on Twitter. Oh man, it's kind of sick how much joy I get out of being cool to old white men. White people marking up the internet with their opinions like dogs pissing on fire hydrants and hashtag cancel white people. Vox published not one, but three separate articles defending Sarah. They even went as far as categorizing Sarah's comments as the expressive way anti-racists and minorities talk about white people. And they categorized the arguments from the other side as a major bullying tactic of the alt-right. I don't think anything else needs to be said about this situation. Over the years, these types of situations have simply increased in popularity, leading to much of the distaste surrounding Vox. It's incredibly ironic that Vox is a Latin for voice. Yet they're actively involved in the censorship and deplatforming of people and the groups they dislike. If I see there's a source, then I always backtrack the information. Not a source that I'd like to link to other people as being reliable. Not to say everything is wrong, just more likely to be twisted in some way. Their gimmick is claiming to be objective explainers of the news, but in fact, they give it a strong leftward spin. And this seems to be the primary issue with Vox. In the end, Vox started off as an ambitious startup that was looking to achieve something that traditional media couldn't. This meant conveying seemingly boring topics in a fun and intuitive manner while maintaining objectivity and clarity. But instead, it seems that Vox has fallen into the same trap as traditional media. They ended up choosing one side and going deeper and deeper. At this point, they're so far to one side that they believe that centrism is actually the media's biggest bias. And I think this one reddit comment described the situation the best. It's pseudon news. Yes, it conveys facts and explains current events. But it does so with bias and they often cherry pick evidence. Good entertainment, but not something you should watch if you're genuinely trying to inform yourself on topic. And that's what happened to Vox. I do gotta say though, despite their shortfalls, their production quality is still insane. So respect there. Anyway, are you guys fans of Vox? Comment that down below.

You merely adopted the dark. I was born in it, molded by it. Ahem. That's my impression of Bane in 2012's The Dark Knight Rises when he's chastising Batman for using the dark to his advantage. Now my impression sucks, but there's arguably no character more associated with movie darkness than Batman. With 13 on-screen appearances across nearly 60 years, Batman is one of the longest running franchises. And when you take films from across different eras and compress them into one big barcode looking thing, they can serve as a sort of proxy for a story about the darkening of movies and TV in general. In the 1960s, Batman movies burst with color and brightness. But by 2022's The Batman, I mean, just look at it. It's a movie that lives and breathes darkness. So much darkness that some audience members have complained that it's almost too dark. You can see the same pattern in the Harry Potter films, and in Game of Thrones, and the Spider-Man franchises. So yeah, it's not just you complaining. Movies and TV shows are getting darker, and there are a few reasons why. Check out this graph by Stephen Follows, a data researcher for the film industry. He charted the top 100 grossing films in the US from 2000 to 2015, and what type of camera they were shot on. This point here, it's where movies flipped from film to digital. And this shift from film to digital is part of the reason for this shift. The biggest difference between shooting dark scenes on film versus digital is not knowing exactly what you have. My name is Brett Jutkiewicz. I'm a cinematographer. Some of my recent work includes Ready or Not, A Black Phone, Scream, and Stranger Things Season 4. When shooting a movie on film, there is way less room for error and way more opportunities to make mistakes. For one, there are no monitors that will show filmmakers exactly what a shot is going to look like before they record it. There are video taps for film cameras, but they're really just a reference for framing. It's really not representative of how the image will actually look. It's using a light meter and measuring the light in the scene and trusting that you're getting what you want. If you do shoot a dark scene on film, there isn't much room to correct it later, because the information in the darkest parts of the image is essentially lost. The overall image just becomes grainier. And in Hollywood, there's little room for error. You really can't do a scene again. Just paying for the day, the location, there's really no room for going back and redoing something if it comes out too dark or if it's not exactly what you want. Take a look at these two shots. This one from 2002's Spider-Man was shot on film. This one from 2012's The Amazing Spider-Man was shot on digital. See how much brighter Spider-Man and Mary Jane's faces are? With film, the safest bet is to shoot with plenty of light, even if scenes are meant to be dark. Shooting digitally allows you to take more chances with darkness, because digital shoots usually have high quality digital monitors. The way that it allows people to see the image as it will be when it's finished lends itself to taking more risks. Plus, digital cameras are generally more sensitive to light. They do capture more into the highlights and more into the shadows than a film stock can. Digital cameras, like the one we're using to film this right now, shoot in what's called a log format. This essentially is when the camera sensor is capturing a really flat, grayish image in order to preserve information in the highlights and the shadows. Once you bring that footage into a color grading software, you have tons of room to push that footage around. And instead of losing detail in the darkest parts of the image, like you would with film, you can push it way brighter and still retain that detail. And the overall image doesn't get super grainy either. Now, I know what you're thinking. Lots of very successful dark scenes have been shot on film, from The Godfather to The Dark Night to Euphoria. It's not impossible to do dark scenes on film. It's just harder and riskier. Regardless of film or digital, shooting dark scenes is always a balance between information and artistic intentions. There was an episode in Severance. There's shots in that sequence where you really are only seeing just a sliver of his face in this sea of darkness. And watching it, I was struck by it. There's instances where you really want to focus on one thing in the frame and using darkness as a tool to kind of guide the eye in that way. Darkness only feels like a problem when it feels like we're missing out on visual information that we think we're supposed to see. It's tricky because at the same time as you want to create a mood and a feeling for the audience, you don't want to also get in the way of them enjoying the show. It's a balance. Filmmakers are using the best screens the world has to offer in perfectly dark rooms when tweaking the brightness of the content that we're all watching. So filmmakers choose to make something look right on the best screen and they expect that vision to trickle down to whatever screen you end up watching it on later on down the line. It's impossible to know how people are going to watch it in the end. If you make it look good on a low quality television, then when people are in the theater, it's not going to look right for them. So yes, what you're watching is dark, but it's also exactly what the filmmaker wanted you to see. There's hope that movie darkness is still evolving for the better. At Astra and Nope, we're filmed using regular cameras and infrared cameras. Infrared cameras allow filmmakers to essentially steal light from the sections of the light spectrum that are invisible to the human eye. It also creates a black sky, which is useful for compositing. When blending the two images together, you can produce a darkness that allows you to peer much deeper into the dark expanse than normal movie darkness would.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1084\n","\n","Link  115 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/BlKVfJg4hHE\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/BlKVfJg4hHE\n","[youtube] BlKVfJg4hHE: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] BlKVfJg4hHE: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 13.03MiB in 05:17\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  It's December 2nd, 2010, and the International Federation of Association Football, or FIFA, gathered in Switzerland to announce which country would host the 2018 and 2022 World Cups. And they had assembled a powerful audience. Here is former U.S. President Bill Clinton, who was there to back the U.S. bid. And here is Prince William, working on behalf of England's bid. Behind him is the Prime Minister of the Netherlands and former Prime Minister of Belgium, who together submitted a joint bid. But even with all this political power in one room, the fate of their countries lay in the hands of these guys. The 22 FIFA officials with the power to pick the host. They were considered gods by their bidding nations. They were the masters of their destiny. But many of these men have been accused of abusing their power. And this was the moment they took it a step too far. 2018 FIFA World Cup, ladies and gentlemen, will be organized in Russia. The 22 FIFA World Cup is Qatar. The decision is still one of the worst decisions made by a sporting organization. It was catastrophic for FIFA. They've had their whole legacies called into question. The announcement set off a cascade of events that rocked the world of football and nearly broke FIFA. A rampant and deep-rooted corruption. Corruption and bribe. A widespread corruption in the internet. Steering and money laundering. How did FIFA go from organizing one of the most beloved sporting events in the world to corrupting it? Ready. In the early 20th century, football was already super popular, mainly in Europe and South America, where national teams had begun playing each other. So a group of officials in France formed FIFA in 1904 to oversee these competitions and promote the sport. In 1930, inspired by the Olympics, they decided to start their own tournament. The first question was, who would host it? Out of FIFA's 44 member countries at the time, six placed bids to host it. FIFA's congress, made up of one representative from each country, was put in charge of voting for a winner. But really, this vote was a facade. So there was no bid contest as such. It was effectively decided behind closed doors by a bunch of committee members. Eventually, FIFA awarded Uruguay the rights to host the first World Cup, and it was a fitting place to do it. Uruguay had just won the last two Olympic gold medals in football. But it also agreed to pay for a lot, including the travel expenses of other teams and share the profits with FIFA. In July 1930, 13 teams came together to play. Uruguay beat Argentina in the finals, and FIFA made a solid profit, mostly from ticket sales. The World Cup was a success. Over the next couple of decades, FIFA decided to rotate the tournament between Europe and South America. The World Cup wasn't a grandiose thing back then. You know, there were some upgrades to the stadiums, with existing infrastructure, there'd be some marketing going on. But the World Cup wasn't a truly global event. That all changed when it went on TV. Once the whole world could watch the tournament, the host nation became much more visible, leading many more countries to want to host one. In virtually every country, football has now such a following that no government can afford to ignore it. Through the 60s and 70s, FIFA's membership started exploding. By the 80s, it had close to 170 members, mostly divided into six confederations with their own qualifying tournaments. And the organization kept getting richer. Take a look at how FIFA's profits grew steadily with almost every tournament until boom in the 1980s. That's when World Cup sponsorships, merchandise, and TV rights became worth millions. All of this money was largely controlled by 24 officials, the leaders of each confederation, and some senior officials like the president. This group was called the Executive Committee, or EXCO. They had the power to distribute FIFA's money to its member countries for building football fields, holding tournaments, and establishing youth programs. Very often this was done without any checks in place. Lots of money was siphoned off. You know, a development money kickback became almost standard practice in certain parts of the world. FIFA leaders began using corrupt practices to gain and retain power. The corruption that went on suited the two presidents. Havilland was nakedly corrupt and he took bribes that's well documented. Seth Blatter was very different. He was addicted to power. There was a cabal of nakedly corrupt committee men within FIFA. And Mr. Blatter ignored their excesses because he relied on their support to keep himself impelled. It was in this culture of corruption that FIFA, in 1964, decided to take the vote away from Congress and give it to EXCO. Meaning that to host a World Cup, countries only needed to win the votes of a majority of EXCO. Just 13 of them. The fact that such a small body of men had such a powerful position vested among them without any real checks and balances, yeah, it absolutely made corruption part of it. FIFA's corruption wasn't a secret, but they had moved their headquarters to Switzerland long ago. And that meant their finances couldn't really be traced to confirm corruption. At least for another decade. The 2006 World Cup bid was the most competitive in FIFA's history. It had previously begun accepting bids from countries outside of Europe and South America. It awarded hosting rights to the U.S. in 1994 and South Korea and Japan in 2002. For the 2006 World Cup, five countries wanted to host it and for good reason. I think there's a huge amount of prestige that it brings to not just the country, but the leadership of the country. It's sort of a step on the way towards nation building. With more and more countries desperate for World Cup prestige, FIFA found ways to play them off each other. The bidding countries spent millions of dollars on a two-year gauntlet of PR events to impress FIFA. And tried to outdo each other by promising new stadiums, hotels, infrastructure and lucrative TV offers. This became the well-known public-facing side of the bidding process. That was the start, I think, where the World Cup became really very heavily politicized. When the 2006 vote came to a close, Exco chose... Deutschland. Thanks to one voter abstaining at the last moment. Journalists had later revealed that Germany had bribed at least four Exco members for their votes, including the official who abstained. It was the first publicly reported incident that revealed FIFA had another layer to its bidding process that involved cutting deals with Exco members under the table. Because of a lack of criteria that governed where the World Cup was going to go, the old man who sat on its executive committee were wined and dined and indulged for a significant period of time and in some cases, quite handsomely, remunerated. And it happened again for the 2010 World Cup bid, which South Africa won. Allegations would later emerge that it too had paid Exco members for their votes. This shadier side of the bid was becoming vital to winning. And in the next two bids, it would destroy the legacy of the World Cup. In the lead up to this announcement, FIFA had decided that the 2018 Cup would be in Europe. Four bidders emerged. England, with its expansive infrastructure, was the heavy favorite. For the same reasons, the US was the favorite among five bidders for 2022. But of course, this was only part of what it took to win a World Cup bid. The countries that did win the vote that day were the ones who could pour the most money into all levels of FIFA's system. People often overlook Russia. You know, Russia's very much at the forefront of everybody's mind. As long as someone like Vladimir Putin were behind it, then they were always going to be very competitive in that process. This is Bonita Murciades. She saw the World Cup bidding process from the inside while working on Australia's bid that same year. They had the capacity, they had the technical capability, they had the facilities. Russia pledged to spend $10 billion and the use of 16 stadiums. But equally important was the fact that they stacked their bid with rich, influential, and well-connected people. The head of the Russian bid was Igor Shvadov. The Russian sports minister and the president of the Russian Football Association was also heavily involved, and that they brought in some of their oligarchs to help support it financially, such as Abramovich. What does that tell you? It tells you we've got money. We've got basically fuck you money. We can do what we like. And they did. Ex-co-member Rafael Salguero would later admit that he agreed to accept $1 million for his vote from Russia, and Jack Warner allegedly received $5 million for his. Russia was using the full weight of its government, corporations, and connections to win every layer of the bid process, just as FIFA had designed it. And they weren't the only ones. The reason why I thought Qatar was always a possibility was this wasn't just about the World Cup for them. It was the government seeing this as an important step in their nation-building. So they really, really wanted it, and they had deep pockets. At first glance, Qatar's bid was a long shot. It's a fairly small country, with a football team that's never qualified for the World Cup. It was also too hot for football. Temperatures could reach 50 degrees in the summer. And in 2010, Qatar only had one major city and one stadium big enough for a World Cup game. But what Qatar did have is some of the largest natural gas reserves in the world, with an enormous amount of wealth, all controlled by the country's emir, Hamad bin Khalifa al-Thani. And they were willing to use it to win the 2022 bid. It pledged to spend an astonishing $200 billion on infrastructure and build 12 brand new air conditioned stadiums. A bid other countries couldn't match. And they didn't forget about Exco. British journalists would later allege that a Qatari-owned company paid Warner around $2 million for his vote. There's also allegations that Qatar made payments to three other Exco members. But Russia and Qatar's advantages went beyond wealth. They were the only two authoritarian countries in the contest, meaning they were freer to work the shadier side of the bid. The Australian World Cup was very well funded as well, but it was all publicly funded. And every cent was meant to be accounted for. Maybe you could move stuff around spreadsheets and so on. But if you were going to engage in the dark arts, you had to be very, very careful. Whereas if you were coming from an authoritarian state like Russia or like Qatar, you can do what you like. FIFA created a bidding process that would inevitably be won by the countries with the most cash and the least accountability. And the thing is, Russia and Qatar got away with it. But the scandals that followed nearly destroyed FIFA. Allegations emerged weeks after the 2010 vote. But it wasn't until 2015 that the FBI arrested several FIFA officials in Zurich and launched investigations into decades of FIFA's dealings. Even though no one's been put on trial for taking bribes from Qatar, since the vote, 13 of the 22 Exco voters present that year have either been indicted or banned from FIFA at some point. Amidst these scandals, Sepp Blatter resigned in disgrace. So in 2016, in an attempt to clean up its act, FIFA gave Congress the power to vote on World Cup hosts once again. But the 2018 World Cup in Russia went on as planned, generating record revenue for FIFA. And Qatar is predicted to do the same. Are we comfortable with the human rights record of Qatar and Russia? Are we comfortable with what Russia is doing at the moment? That decision has been a great enabler for both those countries. It's a decision that just doesn't stand the test of time at all. They didn't get it right then, and it's not right now.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 2072\n","\n","Link  116 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/C-0CebFpF_s\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/C-0CebFpF_s\n","[youtube] C-0CebFpF_s: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] C-0CebFpF_s: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 11.09MiB in 00:00\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  This is where the FIFA World Cup final will soon be held, the Lusail Stadium in Qatar. In just four years, it went from this to this. It has 80,000 seats and cost more than $700 million to build. It's the biggest stadium in the Middle East. But it's more than that. Over a decade ago, Qatar had hoped that hosting a mega sporting event in stadiums like these would put it on the map. But today's stadiums like Lusail are a symbol of how a country can build grand infrastructure to further its own interests, and how those ambitions can trap thousands. Migrant workers lost their lives in the construction of the stadiums. Forced to labour under extremely poor conditions. Migrants working on infrastructure projects have died or suffered abuse. The logical source of oil for Europe is the Middle East. Since the 1940s, when Qatar discovered huge reserves of oil and then gas, it's been one of the richest countries on earth. 70% of the government's revenue comes from oil and gas exports. Thanks to all that wealth, Qatar has gone through a remarkable transformation. The capital, Doha, for instance, went from fishing town to world-class city in just a couple of decades, complete with extraordinary museums and fancy hotels. But in recent years, the world has been turning to renewable energy, making the oil and gas market Qatar relies on even less dependable. And in the Gulf, the country has seen regional tensions surge. Most notably in 2017, when neighbouring countries issued a blockade against Qatar, cutting off trade and travel. It cost the country hundreds of millions of dollars. So to diversify and protect its economy, Qatar has started leaning into another area that helped establish its status as a wealthy nation. Sports. That repositioning is based on soft power. Qatar is trying to secure friends when in need, particularly powerful friends from the West like the United States and the UK. And so the best way to do that is through these soft sectors like sports. In the last 18 years, Qatar has held more than 20 major sporting events. But nothing compares to the 2022 World Cup. The winner is Qatar. Qatar won the rights to host the World Cup in 2010. It had made an unbeatable promise to FIFA. It would spend more money than any host had ever done before. Two hundred billion dollars. And it delivered. Since then, Qatar has built up eight stadiums. It's built dozens of hotels and laid down miles of roads and metro lines to connect all that infrastructure. They've even completed a whole new city with golf courses, marinas and a theme park. It can brag that it is the first Middle Eastern country that's ever hosted a mega sporting event. To be able to do that, you have a lot of partners, including FIFA itself and all the celebrity ambassadors who are vouching for Qatar having these incredible world class stadiums, these glowing glistening hotels. You can come to Doha and feel secure that you're experiencing a world that's business savvy, that's modern and advanced. While the spotlight was supposed to show Qatar as a shining example of development, it also exposed one of its darkest secrets. To power decades of development, Qatar has relied on a constant supply of temporary low-paid workers, mainly from South Asia and East Africa. Since the early 2000s, so many foreigners have come to work in Qatar, they now make up 80 percent of the total population. They build, clean, serve and staff pretty much every industry. When we think about how migrant workers' recruitment journey commences, we think about workers who are in extremely low wage situations. So they are looking for a case where they can emigrate to allow them some upward socio-economic mobility. And Qatar promises them that mobility. Typically, Qatari companies hire international recruitment agencies that find workers to send over. They promise these workers well-paying jobs in exchange for illegal recruitment fees up front. They also have the workers pay for medical tests, passports, flights, the visa, all to get the job contract. The workers often take out loans in their home countries to pay the agencies, incurring significant debt. It's a huge transnational cross-border operation which completely screws workers at the start of their journey. Workers often use their family savings to pay for a job in one of the richest countries per capita in the world. They arrive in Qatar often to find they're not getting the job and salary promised and can't do anything about it because they've now entered the country's kafala system. It's a uniquely restrictive immigration system that can take different forms in different industries. But they all have one crucial thing in common. Kafala legally ties the immigrants' immigration status to their employer, meaning an individual employer has to sponsor their worker which gives them an inordinate amount of power over them. They can control when their employees' job ends or if they can change jobs. They can control if and when migrants leave the country, often by confiscating their passports. And they can also control the workers' ability to renew their residency and work permit. But beyond the restrictions on a migrant's freedom of movement, this system also traps them in a cycle of abuse, and that became evident when Qatar started preparing for the World Cup. To deliver on the infrastructure Qatar promised, it tapped into its migrant pipeline and recruited hundreds of thousands of new workers. When Qatar was awarded the World Cup in 2010, all of the people involved in the decision making knew that the World Cup would be built based on the kafala system. Thousands of migrants turned into construction workers to build stadiums like Lusail, which became the site for human rights abuses that range from verbal abuse to death. Several investigations into Qatar's stadiums revealed that employers usually house workers in private camps far from city centres, where they are forced to live in overcrowded rooms and unsanitary conditions. And at work, their lives are put at risk. Migrant workers are often given the most dangerous jobs on the site, and can be forced to work up to 14-hour days in Qatar's extreme heat. The day this photo of Lusail Stadium was taken, the high reached 114 degrees Fahrenheit. They have spent so many hours in the blistering sun, and after that they are only permitted a five minute break to eat, and they eat standing and then go back. Whenever you're also up on a scaffolding, coming down for a bathroom break might get you in trouble with your boss, and so you end up drinking less water, despite the need to have it to avoid heat exhaustion. The number of work-related migrant deaths surrounding stadiums remains unclear due to Qatar's lack of transparency. In fact, that's the case with the entire kafala system, but there have been some clues along the way. The death certificates Nepal has received with the bodies sent back from Qatar show that nearly 120 Nepali migrants have died on the job since 2008. The real number, though, is likely much higher. In 2019, a study examined the link between Nepali worker deaths and heat exposure, and concluded heat stroke was a likely cause of cardiovascular deaths. That alone could raise the number of just-Nepali migrant worker deaths to about 600. In addition to living and working in abusive conditions, many are also not getting paid for their work. Workers have repeatedly faced wage theft. So then the debt keeps jacking up because the debt still exists, and in many cases workers have still not been able to survive on a daily basis. This is one of the richest countries in the world, and yet they have been able to accelerate reforms and ensuring people are being paid on time. Some workers try to file complaints only to find there are few effective mechanisms in place. And speaking out comes with risk of retaliation, which has kept migrants isolated in the kafala system with increasing debt and unable to access justice. After years of mounting pressure from human rights organizations and a formal complaint that reached the UN's International Labour Organization, in 2017 Qatar signed an agreement promising to align its laws and labour practices to international standards. In 2020, 10 years after construction for the World Cup began, Qatar implemented a minimum wage for workers and now allows them to terminate their employment contract. But the challenge with the minimum wage law is enforcement. Employers started pushing back against the government. And so even though we haven't seen amendments to the legislation, indeed we're seeing a watering down of reforms. And for the migrants who have already been abused through the kafala system, this is all too late. Civil rights groups and football associations are now calling for a remedy fund to compensate the migrant workers financially. And some teams have taken a stand in the field. And on social media. We have learned that the decision to host the World Cup in Qatar has resulted in the suffering and in the harm of countless of our fellow workers. Making this year's World Cup a particularly difficult one to watch. Millions of football fans will still tune in and cheer for their favourite teams. But after that final match is over and the trophy is awarded, stadiums like Lusail will continue to be a grim reminder that it all came at a human cost..\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1592\n","\n","Link  117 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/lrAFaONyLtU\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/lrAFaONyLtU\n","[youtube] lrAFaONyLtU: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] lrAFaONyLtU: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 8.77MiB in 01:58\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  One of my lifelong goals is to find an Earth-sized planet in an Earth-like orbit about a Sun-like star. One that has a thin atmosphere and that has water oceans. One where we can point to a specific star and say that star has a planet like Earth. What I love to dream about is maybe there's some life on that planet, you know, looking back at our Earth and our star and saying the same thing. Like how amazing would that be? It would be amazing. Now this idea that the stars have planets of their own and that those planets might have aliens living on them has been around for centuries. At first it had some pretty harsh critics. But by the 20th century it was mainstream. Alien worlds showed up in books and then movies and TV. In this galaxy there's a mathematical probability of three million Earth-type planets. But here's the thing. Even after all that, even when this episode of Star Trek The Next Generation aired in 1987, scientists still hadn't confirmed the existence of a single planet outside our solar system. For all we knew, these so-called exoplanets could only be found in fiction. But the next generation of astronomers armed with new telescopes and more powerful computers set out to change that. This is Sarah Seeger. She's a professor of astrophysics at MIT. It's the spirit of us being the first explorers. You know, we get to see what's out there for the very first time. We get to know if there are other planets like ours. Here's a map of what they've found so far. It's our night sky, which is a sphere projected onto this square map. It's sort of like one of the maps of the world. It's like, well, obviously we're on a globe, but this is all stretched out. Exactly. Yeah, it's all stretched out. The black dots are visible stars, with the North Star, Polaris, up here at the top of the map. And this band is the densest part of our own Milky Way galaxy. The lines trace out constellations. So we can look for a familiar constellation like the Big Dipper. Up here. And here's Orion, actually. And these colorful dots mark the position of stars with known exoplanets. The very first exoplanet around a sun-like star wasn't discovered until 1995. It was called 51 Pegasi b. And this was an incredible planet. It was astonishing. It's about a Jupiter mass, but the time that it takes to go around its star, remember Jupiter takes 12 years. 51 Peg takes four days. So its year is four days long. Yeah. I don't think you could celebrate New Year's. But on 51 Peg b, you'd have other things to worry about. The planets in our solar system that are about its size aren't great places to live. They're mainly just hydrogen and helium. You know, there's no surface. It just gets hotter and hotter and higher and higher pressure. And eventually we would melt and we would be crushed. Plus, it's really close to its star, much, much closer than even Mercury is to our sun. So it's likely as hot as molten lava. Great. What else we got? After all this dreaming for millennia, it turns out our very nearest star to our sun has a planet. And that is Proxima Centauri. About an Earth mass planet, we don't know the mass exactly, and it's in the habitable zone of that star. The Goldilocks zone, or the habitable zone, has the right temperature for liquid water. It's not too hot, not too cold, but just right for life. The hotter the star, the further away you've got to be, basically. Proxima Centauri is a red dwarf, much cooler than our sun, so you've got to be really close to stay warm. When a planet is this close to its star, its rotation becomes locked, meaning that one side of the planet always faces toward the star, one always faces away. That's what happened to our moon. That's why we only see one side of it. If we could visit the planet, the sun or the star would be in the same place in the sky at all times. So basically, yeah, there would be a line on the world where it would always be sunset or sunrise, essentially. What's going on with this giant blob over here? This blob is where NASA's Kepler Space Telescope stared at for about four whole years. Two, engine start, one, zero, and liftoff of the Delta II rocket with Kepler. The Kepler Space Telescope found thousands of exoplanets by focusing on one patch of sky. Here's all the discoveries made by other telescopes, and here's Kepler's contribution. So back here in the Kepler field, there's a really interesting planet called Kepler-16b. It was the first one where one planet is orbiting two stars. Sometimes science fiction is right, tattooing. But in this case, it's a giant exoplanet. So once again, probably not one where we'd be walking around and talking to Obi-Wan Kenobi or anything. No, no. But still, it is supposedly in or near the habitable zone of Kepler-16. So people like to say if it has a moon, that moon actually could be habitable. Imagine the sky there lit by two suns, two shadows, two sunsets, and dominated by a massive planet. OK, let's look for pretty much the favorite exoplanet system right now. It's called TRAPPIST-1. It has seven planets around it, and they're all around about Earth-mass. So you were talking about Mercury before as sort of a reference point for the distance of the stars. Do you know how far they... Yeah, all these planets would be interior to what would be Mercury's orbit. It's a very cute sort of planetary system. And they're all lined up in a plane. You know, if we were on one of these planets, we could see the other planet in the sky would be bigger than our moon or something. And probably moving then. I mean, you would look up and see a moon shooting across your sky. There would be a lot to do for amateur astronomers. Scientists think that planets ENF fall into that sweet, sweet Goldilocks zone. But even if that's off, some of these planets must be the right temperature for life. The James Webb Space Telescope......which launched on Christmas morning, 2021......has targeted every planet in the TRAPPIST system. So we'll be learning a lot more about it. And what's going to be different about that versus what we've seen before? The James Webb will be much more powerful. It has a bigger collecting area. And it'll be orbiting very far from Earth, where the environment is just quieter and darker. Plus, the telescope can see infrared light, which will make it easier to study exoplanet atmospheres. This is where the science seems to be headed. Fewer surveys of broad swaths of sky. More targeted investigations of nearby stars and the atmospheres of planets we've already found......to see if any of our neighbors might support life. You know, there's sort of a habitable zone for marshmallows, too. Actually, there really is. And it's down here, right? That's right, yeah. Okay, here we go. Oh, yeah. So we found, like, 4,000... Yeah, thousands....thousands of planets. What has been most exciting to you? It's everything. I mean, it's the sheer surprise. Like, we'll find planets we had no idea existed. In our nice, familiar system, we've got a handful of petite, rocky planets......and a handful of massive, fluffy giants. And nothing in between. But out in the rest of the galaxy, the most common planets we've found......are big, dense rocks nicknamed Super-Earths and big, less dense sub-Neptunes. To me, what's the most mysterious is our solar system is not incredibly common. The surveys have been going on for long enough that they should have seen......lots and lots of Jupiters, but they... Maybe they only found one or two that resemble ours. And still, no sign of a true Earth twin. Do you think that that's out there? It's definitely out there somewhere. The question is, is one around a near enough star......that the telescopes we're trying to build can actually find? Even if we do find that, though......it won't be for a long time that we ever are able to visit or communicate. And maybe never. So what's the point? People always ask me, why are we doing this? Why are we searching for other planets? Why do we want to find another Earth? It's human nature to explore. We want to know what's out there. We've surveyed all the land on Earth, most of the oceans. And what's out there now is outer space. We want to try to understand why are we here? How did our Earth come to be? And finding other worlds like our own is a step in that direction.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1500\n","\n","Link  118 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/S1m-KgEpoow\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/S1m-KgEpoow\n","[youtube] S1m-KgEpoow: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] S1m-KgEpoow: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 22.21MiB in 00:00\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  This is Jake. Hi, I'm Jake. In February 2020, he posted his first video to TikTok. All right, mom, what are you doing today? I'm gonna make a beat. I had my mom make a beat that I had already pre-made and I record her, I'm like, okay, press these buttons and we'll make it look like you just made it in two minutes. I need a producer tag. Okay, what do you want to tweet? Ayo, mom, on the beat. Within hours, the video was racking up millions of views. So Jake made a few more videos featuring his mom, but with one small tweak. My brother had the idea, he was like, yo, what if we like put a TikTok in front of the phone and we filmed it? Hey mom, you ever heard this song before? The format was simple but clever. Jake would mash up songs on TikTok that were already going viral. Hey mom, you ever heard this song before? It worked. With each post, he was racking up millions more views, but he didn't stop there. And we were like, we need to put my vocals on the end of it and if the song goes viral, we can drop it like ourselves and become an artist. Her Baby, part two, featuring yours, Trulie. Up, down, right, down. We're just gonna name myself JBKE and we're gonna go at it. Ayo, mom is gonna make this a bop. Up, down, right, down, looking for your love, baby. It just so happens that the first one that I put my vocals on went absolutely bananas viral. Go, go, go, go stupid. Choose smart like an A plus student. Jake's 15 second snippet of a song was taking over TikTok. Once it was at one million videos, Charli D'Amelio used it. That means that this is about to be insane. It's not ending at a million, it's starting at a million. At the time, Jake didn't even have a manager, but he knew he needed one fast. We have this 15 seconds, we have labels calling us, what do we do? That was actually when I got on the phone with my now manager. He was like, call me right now. He was like, hey, can you finish this song in 24 hours? Clearing the Hood Baby sample ended up taking a few days. By the time we got it out, it was at five million videos. It ended up going to 15 million. If you compound all the views of all the 15 million videos, it's like over nine billion views. This is just the beginning of Jake's story. But what makes it so interesting isn't how dramatic it is, but how often stories just like his occurred in 2020. Over the last few months, I've been working with a pudding to put experiences like Jake's into perspective. We dug into the data and stories behind dozens of emerging artists TikTok hits to figure out what internet fame actually means for new music artists. It turns out this is way more than a story about algorithms or going viral. It's a story about the longstanding tug of war between artists, platforms, and music industry giants. You might be surprised who's winning. I would review this project. I'd probably like never do it again. This is Matt Daniels. He's a journalist at The Pudding where he digs into culture stories through data. In the fall of 2021, we started a project that turned into what Matt describes as one of the hardest data projects I've ever worked on. It seems simple on paper. Create a data set of indie and DIY artists that went viral on TikTok in 2020 and determine if that's a good thing and determine if that virality was enough to change the outlook of their career. Because it really was their first major, major exposure to a huge fan base on the internet. But there were a few big problems right from the start. The biggest was there wasn't a useful data set of the most popular songs on TikTok from 2020. We banged our head against the wall trying to figure out how do we reconstruct charts from TikTok. It turns out there's a lot of playlists on Spotify that compile viral TikTok hits. And there's also this tool called Chartmetric which among other things captures historical data of those playlists and tracks what songs have been added and subtracted to them and when. So we got to work and pulled all of the songs from as many playlists as we could find that were added between January and December, 2020. Then we ranked the songs by their popularity on TikTok filtering out any that cut fewer than a hundred thousand posts, which brought us down to about 1500 songs that went viral in 2020. The biggest challenge I would say is once we had our arms wrapped around these 1500 songs making the decision of is this an established artist that had a TikTok hit or is this the artist's big break? And a big break is a very subjective decision. A lot of the artists in our list were obviously very established. Cardi B going viral on TikTok is not particularly impressive versus somebody who has never released a song before. So we went back to Chartmetric to dig into more data points behind these songs and the artists that made them. Including their Spotify monthly listeners, the number of times they've been playlisted, the number of tracks they've released, which made it a lot easier to decide, did this artist have a career beforehand? Eventually, after filtering out all of the established artists, we narrowed our list to a sample of 125 artists we felt hit all of the marks. They all went viral on TikTok in 2020. And as far as we could determine, it was their big break. Can I also like say something really quickly? Yeah, yeah. It doesn't actually matter how many artists we examined. There's probably thousands of new artists that went viral on TikTok. So what we wanted to do was just wrap our arms around a cohort of artists that are experiencing this phenomenon and then say what happened to them afterwards. What happened to these artists after they went viral was eye-opening. And nearly every one of those stories starts with Spotify. The speed and the intensity with which TikTok sends things viral is crazy. That's Elias Light. He's a music journalist and his reporting on TikTok in the music industry is extensive. The virality itself is not necessarily new, but TikTok is basically just like a machine gun shooting out viral songs, like even more than daily, honestly. The two big differences are how many viral moments it creates and then how directly that virality correlates with streaming increase, which is why the labels are so obsessed with it. You can see how that played out in real time by looking at this chart, which captures the explosive virality of Jake's track, Upside Down, on TikTok. But what it doesn't show is that while Jake's track was going viral, people were flocking to Spotify to stream it. This is the TikTok to Spotify pipeline. I remember when we first released the song, it was just like a bottle rocket. Up to like 500,000 streams a day, I was like, what is happening? I didn't even know really what that meant at the time. What it meant is that the track was going to get playlisted. In fact, within a month of Upside Down's official release, it was on 98 editorial playlist, including New Music Friday, which has almost 4 million followers. It landed on the global viral 50 Spotify charts. And as a result, Jake went from zero monthly listeners on August 18th to 3.4 million by October. As I'm editing this piece, he has over 8 million. This pipeline from TikTok to Spotify wasn't unique to Jake. It happened to nearly every one of the 125 artists on our list. So I feel like TikTok is one of the main platforms where people actually leave the app to go and add music to their library. That's Eldre, whose song Steven Universe has been used in more than 10 million video posts. Whenever one of my videos went viral, most of the comments were people begging me to release it. That's kind of the culture on TikTok. When they hear something, they really want to go listen to it. So I pretty much went from having like, I don't know, just like a few thousand monthly listeners to just a rapid incline for like a year or two straight where it was just steady going up. And what was more exciting to see was that almost all of the artists, including Eldre, had some of their other tracks get editorially playlisted. That's really important because it means that once you're on a playlist that Spotify curates, it's getting a huge audience. It's a huge signal that the music you're releasing is gonna get streams. To get a better sense of how the TikTok to Spotify pipeline worked, Matt and I analyzed another chart, the Spotify 200. It's a global chart that shows the top 200 songs on the app every day. These songs are stream kings. So in a new spreadsheet, we pulled all the artists whose songs made the US Spotify 200 after January, 2020 and filtered out all of the artists who had well-established careers or had already charted before then. This left us with a new data set to analyze. These 332 emerging artists who landed on the charts for the first time. Out of this group, a quarter of them have TikTok to thank for their big break. This is incredibly eye-opening in terms of TikTok's influence on the charts, in terms of what it's getting listened to in music culture. But let's backtrack a second because it's not just about racking up millions of streams. It's about how fast you're able to do it. And it's not just about how virality influences music culture. It's about how it influences music business. So Spotify basically pays out labels according to their share of total streams in a given time period. And if you get a really big hit that, you know, does a billion streams over six months or something, that can add a few points to your market share, which then increases your payout of the Spotify pool. It's really like a ruthless competition for this market share number that no listener cares about at all, but the record labels watch obsessively. Despite this obsession, look what's happened over the past four years. Major labels have slowly conceded their total Spotify market share to independent and self-released artists. To get back a bigger piece of the pie, labels developed a strategy. Monitor TikTok like a hawk and aggressively try to sign artists that are rising to the top. In a way, TikTok's great for the labels. They basically sit on top of it, watch everything come up, and if they get it at the right time, they can probably make their money back on pretty much one track. The intensity of these bidding wars around viral songs is pretty wild. It's like a flat-out sprint to grab the next viral thing. Here's a headline I've seen everywhere, and for legal reasons, I've made a generic version of it. Artists with viral TikTok song inks million dollar record deal with major label. Let's break it down. Yeah, so you're an artist, you have a song, and it's doing really, really well, and all these record labels are hitting you up. They're like, I wanna sign you. How can we be a part of this conversation? So then they will entice you with money, which is an advance. So this million dollar is right here. That's the advance. The more virality you have, the more zeros you'll see. This is Mary Ramani. She's a former TikTok music exec who now runs her own label with Republic Records called Moon Projects. So you know, when I worked at major labels, but under an imprint that was a little bit more indie, I would go in between like 50 to $100,000 for advance, and yeah, the major labels are double, triple that sometimes. The label signs you, they give you a fat advance, you know, usually hundreds of thousands of dollars or something like that, in exchange for full ownership of all of your masters, all of your recorded music. So for that million dollars, the label now owns the rights to your viral TikTok song forever and- They would keep around 85% of the royalties that came in, and you only got your 15% if you recouped the cost of your advance. By the way, that's Ari Hurstand. I'm the author of How to Make It in the New Music Business, and I'm an independent musician. So right after you ink your million dollar deal, you see a nice $50,000 check come in from Spotify because your song is still riding that viral wave. $42,500 of that check would go to the label. Only $7,500 would go to you, but it wouldn't stay with you for long because you have to use that check to start paying back your million dollar advance. In essence, an advance is a loan. And if you're only making 15% of the revenue generated by your song, it might take a very long time to pay it back. So you just have to hope you're very smart about the way you use your advance, or you're extremely successful and your album generates millions and millions of dollars, and then you start earning royalties on the back end. The whole approach is basically, you're gonna be 500K, million, 1.5 million in the hole, and you just have to dig yourself out of it. This is what a standard major label record deal has looked like for decades. But recently, this part of the headline has started to change the equation. If you have a viral hit and have proven you can build a following all on your own, congratulations, you have leverage. I mean, if you have a viral hit, probably you're getting a lot of offers simultaneously because labels scrutinize TikTok so closely and they wanna be part of these viral things so badly. Because of that, There's been a bigger shift in the last couple years than there has been in the last 50 years. In the types of deals that labels are starting to offer the artists in the artist's favor, where the label comes to the artist and says, I know historically we would take 85%, but we're not gonna do that for you because you're so valuable and you've obviously proven that you can create a career all on your own. So how about 50-50? We're partners now. And we're not gonna own your stuff. We're just gonna do a licensing deal, meaning give us the rights to your record for the next 12 to 15 years. You can still do whatever you want with it. We'll do whatever we can to make more money on this and we'll split it 50-50. That has never really happened before with self-released DIY independent artists. So how many record deals are actually happening? Matt and I decided to tackle this question from two angles. First, by compiling a list of around 367 emerging artists who landed their first major label deal after January 2020. And then from there, we went row by row, artist by artist, trying to determine, did this person have a viral moment on TikTok? And if so, was that cited as one of the reasons for them getting signed? It turns out roughly a third of these artist deals happened because that artist's song went viral on TikTok. And when Matt and I went back and looked at our original group of 125 artists, we figured out that 46% of them went from unsigned to landing a major record label deal. Because when these artists do have leverage, signing to a major has its benefits. For one, they have direct relationships with streaming services like Spotify, which helps them get more placements on editorial playlists. They're also massive international conglomerates. So they will tell you that they can push you in Sweden and France and Germany and Japan at the same time as they push you in America. At the end of the day, the biggest difference is just that they're massive banks and they can write huge checks. But TikTok has increased the chances for DIY artists to go viral one day and wake up the next morning with a million streams on Spotify without spending millions of dollars to record an album and needing a global team to promote it. This is honestly a subject of a lot of debate right now. If you're able to build a lot of leverage on your own, like how much benefit does a big label offer you and what should you give up? When I looked at the data, I wasn't that surprised to see all these artists signing deals with major labels. What I found more compelling was the group who were likely offered deals and decided to continue on their own, at least for now. It's like, I can promote my music. I don't have to rely on you to make stuff happen for me. The leverage is kind of slowly being put back into the hands of the artist. And it's a beautiful thing to see. When I was browsing our list of 125 viral artists, one name happened to grab my attention, Edith Whiskers. It turns out that name is a pseudonym for the prolific singer-songwriter, Tom Rosenthal. I write fairly boring singer-songwriter music that has gone a bit viral on TikTok. Tom's first viral song was his cover of Home by Edward Sharp and the Magnetic Zeroes. It's been used in 1.6 million TikTok videos. So after the initial kind of crazy TikTok waves hit me, I thought, okay, I'm gonna release this. But then it suddenly dawned on me that if I released it via my own name, I thought this cover would be on the top of my lists forever. I just couldn't bear the idea of writing all these original songs that had one cover just sitting there at the top. So he did the only sensible thing. I came up with four names, put all those names on Twitter, and did a Twitter poll. Edith Whiskers was the favorite. So he released the track on Spotify under the name Edith Whiskers, and it shot straight up to the Spotify viral 50. Basically, if you can name a record label, they reached out. The thing is, Tom is staunchly independent and has some pretty strong feelings about major labels. I'm their worst nightmare, really, because I'm older than 19. When record labels said to me, come and sign with us because these things can drop off and we can help it grow and flourish in its own special way, well, I go, hang on. I've literally got the data from the first one over a year now showing that it basically does roughly the same thing every single day of its life. And I just basically said to each one, look, this is about the kind of money that it would take to get me interested because I know this is the money that I will make off these songs. That knowledge is really important, especially if you're independent. In 2021, just a few months after going viral, Tom started his own record label. So I thought, let's try it. Let's try and create a fair system so I actually have a completely big rethink about how I approach it compared to traditional record labels. The first thing he nixed was the long tradition of advance and recoupment. Obviously not go crazy and invest lots of money, but actually invest, you know, one or 2,000 pounds or dollars in someone and say, look, let's make a few songs. But I'm not looking for that money back. So that's the key difference. I think actually just investing in people rather than it being this odd loan system. I want every artist of mine or my record label to understand money. And the only way they do that is by seeing money come in straight away and understanding how that works. It has never been a better time to be a DIY artist, but that doesn't mean it's easy. I'm at the whims of these almighty algorithms at all times. Like they pretty much decide, you know, whether I'm going to eat dinner or whatever. A few years ago, I started following Eldre on Instagram way before TikTok was even on my radar. And it seemed like he always had content at the ready. I just need to make sure that I'm posting stuff pretty consistently on any platform I can. The fact of the matter is, like, if you want to make it today, you either have to have money to hire people or you just need to also become a video editor, also become a graphic designer. You definitely have to wear a lot of hats for sure. Pretty much everyone I talked to said, if you want exposure, you have to be on TikTok. And not only that, you have to post, post, post. We recommend posting three to five times a week, and now it's three to five times a day. Because there's people out there who are willing to put in the extra work, and you're competing with them now. Even if you are an influencer full-time, it's a lot of work, you know? But it's because there's so much content coming in, and music is one vertical of many. If you're looking to break as a new artist, that is kind of the requirement. The more you post, the more you'll get discovered. Out of all the big existential questions this project hit me with, the one that I can't stop thinking about is this. Is music just content now? Are musicians just content creators? I don't know what the, like, actual meaning of this was, but, like, the video killed the radio star thing. Video killed the radio star. There's more to the equation than just your voice on radio, and I think that's kind of what you're getting at. There's just so much around your ability to create content. On one hand, if you're signed to a label, they can help you with that. But on the other hand, you're signed to a label because you're good at that already. Matt and I spent months poking and prodding at the digital footprint of these 125 artists, examining whether or not they would be deemed successful based on how quickly their TikTok and Instagram followers increased, or whether they gained YouTube subscribers and Spotify monthly listeners. But one metric that's just as valuable is touring. People love you on TikTok, that's great. Will they pay for a show? Can you start selling merch? Like, is there a deeper attachment here? First, we looked at, of these artists, how many were touring beforehand. Unsurprisingly, some of them were. Among the artists who had never toured before or played a show, about a third of them have had at least one show, and about 15% of them are actually playing festivals now. A decent chunk of these artists have been able to channel their TikTok success into performing live music, which is often the source of financial security for an artist. You want people to come to your shows. You want people to buy your albums and your t-shirts and be invested in what you're doing as an all-rounder. And actually, a viral song is obviously great, but it's about building something so much stronger than that. In November 2021, a little over a year after Jake went viral with his mom on TikTok, he played his very first live show. When you perform for the first time after everyone said you were just a TikTokker. One, two, three. Yeah! Oh! Oh! That first moment when I was walking onto the stage, I was walking in kind of slow, just to take in what was actually happening. Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Oh! Yeah, son! I'm ice-scared. As I sang the first lyrics to the song and everyone was just screaming it back at me, I almost was speechless. Hey, but you make me feel some type of way. This is falling, falling. That target we were trying to hit of like, let's convert this virality into something real, like we hit that target spot on.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 4170\n","\n","Link  119 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/caUMtmxa5E8\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/caUMtmxa5E8\n","[youtube] caUMtmxa5E8: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] caUMtmxa5E8: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 6.95MiB in 02:03\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  On September 13th, a woman named Massa Amini was detained by Iran's morality police for improperly wearing her hijab. She was loaded into a van where she was reportedly beaten, and then transferred to a detention center where she collapsed and fell into a coma. Three days later, she died at the hospital, and protests broke out. As a result, Iran shut down the country's internet. But hundreds of social media posts of people protesting her death have surfaced over the last three months, including videos of women defiantly cutting their hair, the symbol of beauty the regime wants hidden under the hijab. The so-called morality police patrol the streets to enforce the regime's strict dress code. They mostly target women and how they wear the hijab, and will either find them or arrest them and take them to detention centers. They are one part of the repressive state apparatus that wields power over Iranians, but far from the only one. In videos of the protests, we can see different armed groups violently suppressing the protests. Understanding who they might be tells us a lot about the power structure Iranians are fighting to change. In the 1970s, Iran was a secular monarchy that operated as a dictatorship. Under the Shah, Iranians lacked political freedoms, but enjoyed social ones. They also experienced economic growth that rapidly transformed Iran from a traditional conservative society to an industrial modernized one. Soon, economic frustrations and political repression sparked uprisings calling for new Islamic rule. They went on for a year, but the regime remained in place until a crucial turning point. The army declared neutrality. It was then that the monarchy collapsed and gave way to the Islamic Republic that rules today. But that neutrality that allowed the regime to come to power was also one of its biggest weaknesses. The revolutionaries did not trust the army, which was supposed to be loyal to the Shah, but stabbed them in the back. The best strategy was to hedge their bets by creating a branch of armed forces that they could trust much more than the army. Under the supreme leader's rule, the regime kept the old army, but created a separate military group called the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. This group was crucial in the long war Iran fought against Iraq. The Revolutionary Guard played an important role in trying to push back the Iraqi army. And after that, they managed to turn that political capital into economic influence and political power. As their importance grew, so did their domestic security role, which sometimes meant fighting against the people. Videos verified by Human Rights Watch show armed forces beating protesters using assault weapons, and men dressed in black riding motorcycles and firing guns into crowds. These men dressed in black fit the description of the Basish, a paramilitary volunteer militia under the IRGC that's fiercely loyal to the supreme leader. Primarily, it was a force that was created in order to do social control. In September, Amnesty International obtained documents showing the armed forces instructed their chain of command to severely confront protesters, and a local commander ordering security forces to confront mercilessly while going as far as causing deaths. As a result, human rights groups say at least 18,000 protesters have been arrested, and at least 250 have been killed, including more than 60 children. And now, Iran has started carrying out executions. The reason so many protesters are out on the streets is that Iran's power structure doesn't give them any alternatives. Just like the armed forces are a pillar of the Islamic Republic, there are several others supporting the country's power structure. These are just a few of them. And while some should be independent, they aren't. This includes Iran's legislative branch, because while these government bodies are technically elected, they are controlled by the regime's appointed Guardian Council. That means the regime can disqualify candidates and reject laws that go through parliament, overriding the will of the people. The unelected institutions have continuously stymied and sabotaged those reforms, and that has created a sense of despondency within the society. So in the last 20 years, Iranians have taken to the streets at an increasing rate, against electoral fraud, government corruption, economic hardship, and again, today. Soon after Aminie's death, a video of her funeral went viral. Women took off their hijabs and the crowd started chanting. And the chants have taken hold all over the country. Usually the pattern of the protests in the past 10, 15 years in Iran, they often start with much more narrow objectives or demands. But this time around, almost from the get-go, the zero to 100 happened overnight and immediately there were calls for regime change. But the system they are trying to change was built to suppress dissent and protect power at the top. The idea of having multiple power centers and parallel institutions is for the regime to hedge its bets. None of these individual elements can on their own pose a threat to the pinnacle of power in Iran. Making it nearly impossible to topple such a multilayered, decentralized power structure. The fact that there is now no longer any hopes in the possibility of reforming the system from within, it has created a situation in which the younger generation of Iranians increasingly believe that they have nothing to lose. Most of the protesters are young Iranians who were born after the revolution and inherited a system they didn't ask for. Despite the censorship, young Iranians have caught the world's attention. School girls are filming themselves replacing portraits of the supreme leader with the words, woman, life, freedom. Setting their hijabs on fire and chasing pro-regime educators out of their schools. The current situation is the product of the Islamic Republic's failures over the years. The Islamic Republic failed to create a country in which the youth could see a future for themselves. It's really as simple as that.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 998\n","\n","Link  120 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/eiGdsH1g20k\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/eiGdsH1g20k\n","[youtube] eiGdsH1g20k: Downloading webpage\n","[youtube] eiGdsH1g20k: Downloading player 4248d311\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] eiGdsH1g20k: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 3.54MiB in 01:10\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  The reason just needed something different Don't gotta hear what they speaking No, no, don't gotta take what they giving Remember the meaning This old folk song we be singing Ooh, I'ma raise my arms high Ooh, I'ma touch the skyline Ooh, I'ma sing it louder now Ooh, let me be free Pali vaala bhadra vatakam Kailendhum tambu roti Nalla chandhe thirum umil channu kaali Kali thodangi Anganangari Pali vaala bhadra vatakam Kailendhum tambu roti Nalla chandhe thirum umil channu kaali Kali thodangi Pali vaala, paali vaala Pali vaala, paali vaala Pali vaala, paali vaala Nd, bd, bd Heart beat, racing What you feel when your feet hit the pavement Keep on reaching Hold on to what you believing Don't gotta learn what they teaching No, no, don't believe what they preaching Remember the meaning This old folk song we be singing Ooh, I'ma raise my arms high Ooh, I'ma touch the sky like Ooh, I'ma sing it louder like Ooh, let me be free Pali vaala bhadra vatakam Kailendhum tambu roti Nalla chandhe thirum umil channu kaali Kali thodangi Pali vaala bhadra vatakam Kailendhum tambu roti Nalla chandhe thirum umil channu kaali Kali thodangi Pali vaala, paali vaala Pali vaala, paali vaala Nd, bd, bd Heart beat, racing What you feel when your feet hit the pavement Keep on reaching Hold on to what you believing Don't gotta learn what they teaching No, no, don't believe what they preaching Only ever Angan angani Boredy ka, porudu vegham Asureshathaiser Gane Paramisha phatriyannaku sizna Jnanaa lotina Angan angani Pali vaala bhadra vatakam Kailendhum tambu roti Nalla chandhe thirum umil channu kaali Kali thodangi Angan angani Pali vaala bhadra vatakam Kailendhum tambu roti Nalla chandhe thirum umil channu kaali startbelieving\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 288\n","\n","Link  121 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/pQboAGgLRNE\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQboAGgLRNE\n","[youtube] pQboAGgLRNE: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] pQboAGgLRNE: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 937.37KiB in 00:16\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Listen to these notes. Does it sound like they're going up or down? Your answer might actually depend on where you're from. This is a specific interval called a tritone, which takes an octave and divides it in half. So psychologist Diana Deutsch did an experiment. She played tritones in a bunch of octaves at once, so it's hard to tell if they're going up or down. And she took two groups of people and found that people from California tend to hear them going down and people from southern England tend to hear them going up. She thinks it's all about the range of speech you heard when you were a kid and Californians speak lower. So if you hear that first pattern which goes from D to G sharp as falling, you probably hear this second pattern which goes the exact same distance from A to D sharp as rising or vice versa. What we hear might have to do more with us and our brain than what's actually happening out there in the world.

People come here from all over the world to bathe in its waters, to look at the holy book that is inside of this middle golden temple, and to just experience the holiness of this place. This place is the epicenter of Sikhism. It sits right here in northern India, in a city called Amritsar. Close by there's another important Sikh site called Katharpur. It was established by the founder of Sikhism 500 years ago. It's the place where he spent the last years of his life, and it is the second holiest place in Sikhism. For centuries Sikhs have been able to make pilgrimage between these two sites, to move freely throughout their heartland. But in 1947 a British lawyer drew a border here, turning what had been British India into two new countries, India and Pakistan. I can only call it the most bizarre lines which were ever drawn across a map. It went right here, with the Golden Temple on one side and Katharpur on the other. Thanks to this border Sikhs in India are now cut off from their holy site. So many come here, to a platform that the border patrol set up. The platform looks across the border, where with the help of telescopes Sikhs can look at their holy place, just 3 or 4 kilometers away. In addition to cutting off communities from their sacred sites, this border separated families cut across rivers, forests, farms, railroad tracks. Today this border is heavily fortified with nearly all 3000 plus kilometers fenced. It's lit so well that you can see it from space. And barely anything or anyone crosses over it. This is the story of a violent separation, one of the most traumatic events of the 20th century. It's the story of how a hastily drawn line on a map separated one people into two. The sun is setting and I'm walking along one of the oldest roads in Asia, one that used to connect this region. But today a border runs through it. And instead of connection and trade, what you see here is this. There's barbed wire, there's fences, there are officers everywhere, and yet there's also ice cream and popcorn and paraphernalia. This feels like a sporting event. You can buy key chains of machine guns. Thousands of spectators file in, filling this stadium that looks down on the border. On the other side, Pakistanis are doing the same. Then both sides start their different show. Two hours of chanting and dancing. Then the finale, a faceoff between the two sides. They strut back and forth in this coordinated choreography. And it all ends with the lowering of each flag and the closing of this gate. This bizarre border show plays out every evening. But this ceremony, this fence, this intense nationalism, if you rewind just a little in time, none of this existed. The British controlled parts of India for nearly 200 years, but by 1947 a strong movement of independence was swelling across the subcontinent. While back in Britain the country was in massive debt after fighting World War II and didn't have the resources to hold on to their colony. So they started making plans to leave India. British officials thought that a proper transfer of power would probably take around five years. But when the British leader in charge arrived in early 1947, he hastily decided to shrink their exit timeline. And so what needed five years would now need to be done in just four months. British India was to be split into two independent nations, a mostly Muslim Pakistan and a Hindu majority but officially secular India. To do the actual drawing of the border, the British brought in a lawyer from London. He arrived the month before the British were supposed to leave India. He hadn't been to British India before and didn't know much about the region. He had no idea about India. No idea about Indian geography, no idea about Indian politics. And yet he was the one drawing the lines on the map that would affect millions of lives. During his visit, this British lawyer looked at maps and census data, focusing on the maps that showed religious identity of people in India. India has a wide variety of religions and based on these census maps you can see that people of all religions lived amongst each other all over the region. So to draw the line, the British lawyer looked at individual districts, putting any district that had a Muslim majority population into the new country of Pakistan, while Hindu and Sikh majority districts would be kept within India. Based on this method, the lawyer began to see what a border might look like. He only had five weeks to do this. He later wrote that it would have taken years to settle on a proper boundary. And that's because this method of drawing the line conceals that within these districts there were sizable communities of all religions that had been living side by side for centuries, all throughout India. August 15th, 1947, Independence Day for India and Pakistan. But Gandhi is not present. When British lawyer left that day, he would never return to India again. Two days after independence, the borders were made public, prompting more than 14 million people to leave their homes, their lives, for what was now their side of the border. We were told that you have to cross the border, India. We didn't even have a glass of water to drink. We left everything behind. Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan moved into India, and many Muslims in India moved into the new Pakistan. These were people who were indeed forced to lose their entire homes, their memories, their childhood, and the things they saw. It was one of the largest forced migrations of people ever. And it was chaos. A chaos that led to widespread unspeakable violence. Cities on fire. Unreasonable violence against women, trains full of dead bodies. The survivors I talked to were just children when all of this happened. We were told to leave because they were going to kill us. We were told to leave because they were going to kill us. We were told to leave because they were going to kill us. The division of the subcontinent became known as the Partition of India, a phrase synonymous with trauma, fueled by the reckless mismanagement of an imperial power. I'm in a small village right near the border on the Indian side that used to be a Muslim community before partition. And in the middle of town is this shrine, where residents would conduct ornate Muslim burial practices on these graves. If you look at the original maps that the British drew up when they were trying to draw this line, this town was actually in Pakistan in most of the maps. But in the end, the British lawyer decided to draw the line here. The people here discovered that they were now a part of the new country of India. And so many of them fled just across the border to the new state of Pakistan, and they left this place empty. But just as Muslims were leaving this village for the new Pakistan, Hindus and Sikhs from Pakistan were coming across into India, and some ended up here. The Hindus and Sikhs that now live in this community have taken it upon themselves to continue the Muslim traditions that this community was based off of. They continue to maintain these graves and these symbols, even though they don't necessarily pertain to their own religion. This is a sign of respect, of common identity in spite of the border. But this is just one side of the story. Within just a few months of drawing this border, India and Pakistan were fighting an all out war, one that centered on this region in the north, which both sides claimed as their own. The new countries would fight several more wars over the years. A border fence would eventually fortify the majority of this boundary, and both countries would acquire nuclear weapons, turning up the tensions and deepening the division. But if you take away the geopolitical bluster, the nukes, the barrier, the trauma of partition, you can still see how much these two countries have in common. I'm at a school in Delhi. My parents are Skyping with a school in Pakistan.LANGHIO These kids are speaking a similar language, and it takes them just minutes to dive into the common roots of their culture. This shared identity that these kids are feeling isn't uncommon in India or Pakistan. Same language, same taste, same food. Whereas Hindus and Muslims and Sikhs usually live together, attend each other's social functions, marriages, everything. Why this divide now? If you stand in the wall city in Amritsar and you stand in the wall city in Lahore, believe me, the smells which is a kind of giveaway are the same. When visiting a group of Sikhs coming off the train, they were able to get a visa to go visit this religious site that most have to see through a telescope. So with all these cultural similarities, all these happy faces, shared interests, how do you explain this? You see, it is the politician who poisons people's minds. The divide is created, nurtured, fostered because it suits a certain politics. Over the years, politicians on both sides have exploited tension with the other side to stoke feelings of nationalism. Back here at this viewing platform, there's construction vehicles everywhere. For years, the Sikhs have lobbied for easier access to their holy site. And after years, the two governments finally agreed to build a little notch into this border, a corridor that will allow Sikhs to freely access their site without a visa. These four kilometers will restore a small part of what was once the Sikh heartland. But for millions of Indians and Pakistanis who continue to live with the repercussions of the traumatic events of 1947, this fortified and volatile border remains unchanged. If anything, it's getting thicker. Seventy years later, the shadow of partition continues to divide families, halt trade, cut connections, stop cooperation, instill fear, promote hatred. And the people who live in its shadow, on both sides, old and young, continue to live with this division that's superimposed upon their history of deep connection.

For decades it's been home to Egyptian rulers and their palaces. The parliament has met in this building for over 150 years. And this public square in the heart of Cairo has been the site of several revolutions. But in 2015, the Egyptian government announced the capital would move about 50 kilometers away to this patch of empty desert, which is quickly shaping up to be the new administrative capital of Egypt. This is where a new presidential palace will go, the new parliament building, and a new public square. Egypt's government, led by President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, claims this new city will solve a specific problem. Cairo's overpopulation. But the country has a long history of building new cities to decongest Cairo. Many of them sit outside the city today. So, why is Cairo's population still considered a ticking time bomb? And what's the real reason behind this new capital? This is Mohamed El-Shahed, an architectural historian who studies urban development in Egypt. Egypt's home to more than 100 million people, and about 20% of them live within the boundaries of greater Cairo. The city has one of the highest population densities in the world, with 153,000 people per square kilometer at its peak. That's higher than New York, London, and Shanghai. What we know as Cairo today was officially founded on the banks of the Nile. In the 10th century, it was the capital of the Arab Fatimid Caliphate. The city had to be built near the river, because the rest of the region was barren desert. Over the next several centuries, each ruler built expansions of Cairo close to the fertile banks. The Ottomans built these areas, and the British added these suburbs during their decades-long occupation of Egypt. In the 1950s, when the British left and Egypt became a republic, Cairo was by far the biggest city. In the 50s, 60s, and 70s, millions of impoverished Egyptians from the countryside moved to Cairo, in search of opportunities and better living conditions. But the city that was built haphazardly along the river wasn't equipped to house more people. This city was already kind of shaped and demarcated, and the green areas around it were left agricultural. And it's those areas that were cheap and close enough to those amenities that allowed them people to step in, since the housing that was available was completely not sufficient. So farmers started selling small slices of their agricultural land to the migrants. And a lot of people had to build for themselves with little money, so together, so entire families would grow vertical on a small plot of land. These were the first informal and technically illegal neighborhoods. It's informal because it's not given licenses for construction. It's built outside of the economy that is kind of the official economy. And I think this is actually the result of the fact that the economic system really excluded the majority of the population. For decades, Egypt's government failed to build affordable housing or invest in public services and infrastructure to support the explosive growth in Cairo's density. And that meant these unplanned and informal neighborhoods continued to get more and more crowded until it became a crisis. Egypt's capital is bursting at the seams. Cairo is equipped to handle around 3 million. In fact, it's home to 8 million. Housing is the area of desperate need. Many people in Cairo live in makeshift shacks in the city's center and in much worse conditions in the suburbs. Today, these informal neighborhoods are home to 60% of Cairo's population. Most of them are inhabited by the poor, but many have evolved into middle-class neighborhoods. Collectively, these are the most crowded areas of Cairo. And Egypt's government, under Sisi, points to them as the real problem behind Cairo's overcrowding. I find this to be a very problematic narrative because then we take a question of, let's say, bad design or bad management from a state perspective and turn the blame on actually the people who are suffering from the bad design and the bad policies and say there's just too many of you. In fact, the government still considers them illegal, referring to them as slums. From the point of view of the state, that calling an area a slum facilitates its removal. In 2019, the government announced it would eradicate Cairo's slums by 2030. Many neighborhoods will be redeveloped as affluent housing, while thousands of residents will be forcibly pushed out of their homes and into affordable housing outside the city. But instead of focusing on sufficient affordable housing, they invested billions of dollars in a whole new city elsewhere. And it's not the first time an Egyptian ruler has tried to solve the crisis by starting fresh in the desert. A building boom is in progress. New apartment blocks have been going up at a greater rate since the start of NASA's revolution. The concept of a new city as a solution for Cairo's growing population began in the 1950s. The first attempt was under President Gamal Abdel Nasser, who ordered the construction of a new city called Nasser City. It was also designed to be a new capital at the time. There would be space for government buildings, markets, and a huge new stadium. But there was a big flaw. The plan didn't involve affordable housing for the people in Cairo's most crowded areas. The need was for a lot of lower class housing, but that wasn't going to be placed in the new capital, right? Like nobody wants to build a shiny new capital and then fill it with low-cost housing. So it's kind of a trend that already starts there. By the 1970s, Egypt had a new leader, Anwar Sadat, who didn't end up moving the capital to Nasser City. But he really leaned into the trend of building desert cities. Starting in 1976, Egypt's government built eight new cities in the desert around Cairo. Each time they claimed the goal was to alleviate overcrowding. But most included only expensive housing and barely any featured public transportation, making them inaccessible for anyone without a car. That's why today many of these desert cities are only partially occupied. Most to have moved here are Cairo's middle and upper class residents. That means that the majority of the population that's squeezed in the little green belt that's now urbanized around the Nile are kind of hexed out of these developments. So we're looking at a condition that's a result of I would say three to four decades in particular of misguided policy that looks to the outside of the city. President Sisi is continuing that trend with his new capital. These areas are designed for housing, but mostly for middle and upper class residents. Those people are not moving in with handouts. They're buying those properties. And so the main target audience is again a money class. I think the housing for low income communities will be included in the capital, but definitely very limited. All of this land will be used for government buildings, and this section will be a business district featuring this soon to be tallest building in Africa. So if this new capital isn't really about solving Cairo's population density crisis, why is the government so determined to build it? In 2011, protests erupted in Egypt over police brutality, and they quickly evolved into widespread calls for the resignation of Egypt's ruler of 30 years, Hasni Mubarak. Demonstrations took place all over Egypt, but the biggest were in Cairo, specifically Tahrir Square. It's been the epicenter of many political demonstrations since the early 20th century, partially because it's so close to Egyptian government buildings, including the parliament. In 2011, millions of people occupied Tahrir Square for 18 days. They set up roadblocks and battled with police. On February 11th, thousands marched from Tahrir Square to the presidential palace 10 kilometers away, where they ultimately forced Mubarak to step down. The ability to control Tahrir Square and inner Cairo allowed the protesters to effectively paralyze the government, making their presence and their demands impossible to ignore. Sisi remembers that. He was the head of Egypt's powerful military when he seized power in 2013 on the heels of the revolution. Barely a month after taking power, he commanded his soldiers and police to crack down on protesters who opposed him. The brutal raid killed more than 800 people. Ever since, he's been systematically trying to prevent a revolution that could topple him. The government has shut down political dissents, punished journalists, and hindered free speech. Now, they're redesigning several aspects of Cairo to make the city harder to protest in. They've widened dozens of streets, making it more difficult to erect roadblocks. And they plan to add 40 bridges, which will give the military and police easier access to the city center. Sisi's government also renovated Tahrir Square, adding giant monuments and private security guards, which some experts say will make it harder for large crowds to gather. Now they're taking the final step, removing the government entirely from Cairo. Just seven years after announcing the construction of the new capital, government officials are starting to move into these new buildings. Once that's complete, all of Egypt's political power, including Sisi, will be concentrated here, almost 50 kilometers from Cairo. And it will all be under heavy guard. This is the military sprawling complex nearby. Even though there's a public square called the People's Piazza, it's hard to imagine millions of people making the journey from Cairo to demonstrate here. And that may be the point. This distance, plus the military presence, will allow Sisi to defend his power in case of an uprising. So instead of a capital that offers a solution for the people of Cairo, this city is designed to move the government out of their reach.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1660\n","\n","Link  124 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/BShvYeyMm_Y\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/BShvYeyMm_Y\n","[youtube] BShvYeyMm_Y: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] BShvYeyMm_Y: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 9.08MiB in 01:52\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  The modern United States is the most powerful country in human history, with over 800 military bases and 37% of global military spending. The US has become the leader of a vast, interconnected global system that has helped usher in an era of unprecedented prosperity and low levels of conflict. To understand America's position in the world, and why it's so pivotal for world politics as we know it, you have to go back to the country's founding, back to when America wasn't a global power in any sense of the word. In the first 70 years of its existence, the United States expanded in both territory and influence in North America, eventually reaching the Pacific Ocean in a wave of expansionism that resulted in the wholesale slaughter of the indigenous people who populated the continent. But early Americans were deeply divided as to whether the country should expand beyond the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. This became a major debate after the Civil War, when some leaders, like post-war Secretary of State Seward, argued that America should push to become a global power. Seward succeeded in pushing a plan to purchase Alaska from Russia, but his attempts to buy Greenland and Iceland, as well as annexed territory in the Caribbean, were all blocked by Congress. That's because some Americans, including many on Capitol Hill, had a strong anti-imperialist bent. These people worried about America getting more involved in global politics, as well as having to integrate populations from quote-unquote inferior races. And this opposition applied major checks on the imperialist urge to expand. But something was happening in the late 1800s that would change the debate about American expansionism. The Industrial Revolution produced explosive economic growth, and the bigger U.S. economy required a more centralized state and bureaucracy to manage the growing economy. Power became concentrated in the federal government, making it easier for expansionist presidents, like William McKinley, to unilaterally push American influence abroad. The key turning point came in 1898, when President McKinley dragged the country into war with Spain over Cuba, despite some intense domestic opposition. The rising United States easily defeated the Morroban Spanish Empire, acquiring Puerto Rico, Guam, and the Philippines in the process. Over the next two years, the U.S. would annex the Kingdom of Hawaii, Wake Island, and American Samoa. A few years later, the U.S. took control of the Panama Canal Zone and sent troops to occupy the Dominican Republic. It also purchased the American Virgin Islands. This period of rapid acquisition of far-flung territories put the U.S. on the map as a truly global power. During this time, America also began using its influence to protect its growing commercial and military interests abroad, installing pro-American regimes in places like Nicaragua, and playing a major role in international diplomacy regarding the Western presence in China. World War I showed just how much America's influence had grown. Not only was American intervention a decisive factor in the war's end, but President Wilson attended the Paris Peace Conference, which ended the war, and attempted to set the terms of the peace. He spearheaded America's most ambitious foreign policy initiative yet, an international organization called the League of Nations, designed to promote peace and cooperation globally. The League, a wholesale effort to remake global politics, showed just how ambitious American foreign policy had become. Yet isolationism was still a major force in the United States. Congress blocked the United States from joining the League of Nations, dooming Wilson's project. During the Great Depression and the rise of Hitler, the U.S. was much more focused on its own region than on European affairs. Ultimately, America's ever-growing entanglements abroad made it impossible for it to stay out of global affairs entirely. In East Asia, the growing Japanese empire posed a direct threat to American possessions and troops, bringing the United States and Japan into conflict. This culminated in the Pearl Harbor attack, bringing the United States into World War II. World War II would transform America's global presence forever. The United States was the only major power to avoid economic ruin during the war, and it was the sole country equipped with atomic weapons. As such, it was in a unique position to set the terms of the peace, and, with the aim of preventing another war in mind, it took advantage. The most famous example of this is the creation of the United Nations. The U.N. Charter set up a system of international law prohibiting wars of conquest, like the ones waged by the Nazis and the Japanese. It also served as a forum in which the international community could weigh in on disputes and help resolve them. This way, the Americans hoped, great powers could resolve their differences through compromise and law rather than war. But while the U.N. is the most famous of the post-war institutions, it isn't the only one. 730 delegates from all 44 allied nations came together in a small vacation haven in New Hampshire. Their goal? To establish a global financial system that would prevent another Great Depression and World War. The resulting agreement, called the Bretton Woods Agreement, ultimately came the backbone of the global financial system, resulting in the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. By creating these institutions, the United States committed itself to being deeply involved in the world's problems. The issue, though, is that the world's second largest power, the Soviet Union, saw things differently. World War II had made allies out of the democratic West and communist East in the fight against Hitler, but that couldn't last. The United States saw Soviet expansion in Eastern Europe and elsewhere as a direct threat to its vision of a free-trading, democratic world. To a substantial degree, in one form or another, socialism has spread the shadow of human regimentation over most of the nations of the earth, and the shadow is encroaching upon our own liberty. Fearful of Soviet intentions towards Western Europe, the U.S. and other European nations created the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, a military alliance meant to stop Russian from invading other countries in Europe. Globally, the U.S. committed to a strategy called containment, so-called because it was aimed at containing the spread of communism everywhere on the globe. This new global struggle meant that the U.S. had to exert influence everywhere, all the time. Instead of disbanding the massive military machine created for World War II, the wheels mostly kept turning. This had two main results. First, the U.S. was pulled into unlikely alliances with countries like Saudi Arabia, Israel, and South Korea, seeing each of them as bulwarks against communist influence in their region. Secondly, the U.S. began intervening, often secretly, in dozens of countries to contain Soviet influence. Sometimes this meant propping up sympathetic dictators, like in Iran. Other times, it meant supplying rebels with arms and money, like in Afghanistan in 1979 and Nicaragua in 1985. Over the course of the Cold War, the U.S. intervened in hundreds of disputes around the globe, ending up with a complicated set of alliances, tensions, and relationships in basically every corner of the Earth. After the Berlin Wall fell, the U.S. could have withdrawn from the system, severing ties with its allies and drawing down the size of its military. And while the U.S. did decrease military spending, much of the military infrastructure and alliances from the Cold War remained. This George H.W. Bush and Bill Clinton decided that it was in both America and the world's interests for the United States, now the sole superpower on Earth, to continue actively managing global affairs. We should be and we must be peacemakers. NATO, created solely as a tool for countering the Soviet Union, stayed together and even expanded a way of keeping European nations united in the absence of the Soviet threat. Washington's support for countries like Israel and Japan stayed intact, ostensibly as a means of preventing war in their respective regions. The global system of alliances and institutions created to keep the peace during the Cold War became permanent, as did the American military and political commitments necessary to keep them running. This system remains in operation today, and no leading American politicians since the Cold War has seriously called for dismantling it. Except, perhaps, for Donald Trump. Trump has said contradictory things about these commitments, but he's consistently argued that American allies are not paying the U.S. enough for its protection, and question the value of free trade. That calls NATO and even the World Trade Organization into question. At some point we have to say, you know what, we're better off if Japan protects itself against this maniac in North Korea. We're better off, frankly, if South Korea is going to start to protect itself. Saudi Arabia? Saudi Arabia? Absolutely. There's a sharp divergence from the consensus that has dominated U.S. foreign policy since 1945, and something closer to the isolationism that came before it. So will President Trump act on some of candidate Trump's ideas, and reverse decades' worth of institution building and alliances? We'll find out soon enough.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1523\n","\n","Link  125 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/tNVBhBNj1oY\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/tNVBhBNj1oY\n","[youtube] tNVBhBNj1oY: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] tNVBhBNj1oY: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 3.92MiB in 01:14\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Looking up at the moonlight, lost in time Do you know what it feels like to leave it all behind?

E a maioria dos votos foi a dois front runners. Um foi o presidente atual e o líder de far-right, Jair Bolsonaro. Nós defendemos cada vez mais a família tradicional. E o outro foi o presidente anterior do Brasil, o político esquerda, Luiz Inácio da Silva, também conhecido como Lula. Portanto, o país que eu deixei é um país que o povo tem saudade. Durante meses de eleito, Lula se apoiou muito bem contra Bolsonaro e foi esperado que ele vencesse em primeira-rounda. Mas quando os resultados vieram, Lula foi pequeno. Como no vídeo, ele e Bolsonaro estão prontos a enfrentar um em um runoff. Lula é o mais famoso e popular político do Brasil. Em um momento durante sua presidência, seu rango de aprovação era de cerca de 90%. Mas a política brasileira mudou. E a história da carreira de Lula é uma boa forma de ver exatamente como. A política esquerda de Lula é fundada nos dias dele como um trabalhador de fábrica e líder da União. É onde começou seu carreiro como político. Durante a dictadura militar do Brasil, Lula liderou massivos atos e protestos. Em 1980, ajudou a organizar milhares de apoiadores da União de Trabalhadores em uma partida política, a Partida dos Trabalhadores ou PT. A coalição de Lula veio principalmente do lado esquerdo político do Brasil. Incluiu a classe trabalhadora, pessoas de renda, votantes católicos de esquerda, afro-brasileiros e pessoas indígenas. É um arranjo bem único de forças. Na minha opinião, é uma das coisas que permitiu a Partida dos Trabalhadores se tornar tão forte. Em 1989, Lula se tornou candidato para presidente da partida. Ele fez a segunda volta e perdeu apenas 4 milhões de votos. Depois, ele perdeu de novo em 1994 e de novo em 1998. Seu base estava crescendo, mas ainda não o suficiente para ele ganhar uma eleição presidencial. Durante muito tempo, o Brasil estava enfrentando uma crise econômica. Em um momento, a inflação estava tão sem controle que o país mudou a nova corrente cinco vezes em sete anos. E cerca de um quinto do país estava em pobreza. Nos anos ultimos, o governo central brasileiro passou uma série de reformas econômicas dramáticas. Eles derrotaram a inflação por estabelecer uma corrente estabilizada. E eles derrotaram a pobreza. Mas a recuperação também deixou muito do país por trás, incluindo muitos da coalição de Lula. Mas em 2002, quando Lula foi presidente a terceira vez, ele tentou algo um pouco diferente. No race de 2002, Lula trouxe vários membros das partidas conservadoras e centrais do Brasil para a campanha. Incluindo o prominent businessman José Alencar como seu amigo de corrida. Incluindo eles, Lula expandiu sua coalição, atrapalhando o apoio de votadores de direitos centrais, como os business owners e os bancários. Lula é esse cara que pode ir a uma reunião de bordo em uma banca maior ou em uma favela pobre e falar de uma maneira que as pessoas se relacionem com ele. Essa nova kind of coalição levou a Lula a ganhar sua primeira eleição presidencial. Prometo manter, defender e cumprir a constituição. Em seu primeiro termo, a economia do Brasil cresceu rapidamente, principalmente por causa de um parceria de traços com a China. Ele beneficou de um momento mágico econômico. Ele usou esse fluxo de dinheiro para financiar um novo programa de transferência de dinheiro e de welfare social, Bolsa Família, que deu aos brasileiros uma estipa para garantir que os seus filhos atuassem na escola e que estivessem atuando nas suas vacinas. Foi uma maneira de dar dinheiro para as pessoas para seus<|tl|><|transcribe|><|tl|><|transcribe|> E mais brasileiros votaram para o esquerdo e políticos do centro-leveiro por todo o país. Paro pot頭ata kami ng save nint greater afla e pollue Restore aenhâha rin. Hmm. Kumahulogad a bila plastic na percivala na umatala na painingera na lyo na kas Ao final do segundo termo de Lula na Oficina, a GDP foi a maior em história do Brasil. E assim foi o valor de aprovação do presidente. É a política mais popular da Terra. Em 2009, Lula escolheu um membro do Partido de Trabalhadores, Dilma Rousseff, como seu ex-cessário. Ela se inheritou da sua coalição e facilmente ganhou a presidência em 2010. Em early, em sua administração, a demanda global para comodidades caiu, o que causou uma recessão no Brasil. E sua aposta para a gestão da economia custou-lá algum apoio da comunidade de negócios centrais. A administração também enfrentou acusações de corrupção, o que causou mais apoio. Não ajudou. Ela não era uma boa política. Ela não negociou com o Congresso de uma forma muito escala. E a guia econômica da administração dela foi muito falso. E em 2014, algo aconteceu que faria que a colônia inteira colapsasse. Uma investigação do governo descobriu que muitos operadores da Partida de Trabalhadores estavam envolvidos em um esquema corrupção com a companhia da OILE, incluindo Rousseff, que foi atingida por um valor de aprovação, e em 2016 ela foi removida da oficina. Lula também foi implicado por atingir as bribas. Ele foi convicto em 2017 e enviado para prisão. Mas, ao invés de Rousseff, ele ficou popular. Para muitos, apesar de Lula ir para prisão, eles ainda amam ele. Por um, muitos dizem que todos nos roubam, ou pelo menos esse cara nos deu algo de volta. Mas com ninguém dá para segurar a coalição esquerda, a oportunidade surgiu para um político usual começar a construir seu próprio do lado direito. Durante o imprimido de Rousseff, o ex-alivio militar Jair Bolsonaro estava colocando o trabalho de base para sua chance na presidência no ano de 2018. Os apoiadores corelais de Bolsonaro eram os votores evangélicos, os agricultores, os empresários e os votores anti-aborcição. Ele foi candidato à direita, mas também ganhou o apoio do centro-right e até alguns votores de esquerda que estavam desilusionados com a Partida de Trabalhadores criando uma unidade de deputados, que também foi o seu principal objetivo. No entanto, a coalição ex-alivio de Lula foi dividida entre vários candidatos, ajudando a propelar Bolsonaro a uma vitória fácil e signalando um novo momento político no país. O que Bolsonaro fez em 2018 foi inesperado do que nós já havíamos visto. Foi uma real mudança. O direito difícil era o de se replicar ao direito moderado no centro do arco político. Em 2018, o governo de Bolsonaro foi o mais importante do que a política. No governo, Bolsonaro perdi a destruição da Amazônia, a fuga extrema, e o Brasil era um dos mais impactados por a Covid com mais de 680 mil mortos. A GDP do Brasil se desmantelou e ele também tomou uma condição confrontacional com a democracia brasileira tentando controlar o mídio e atingir o Supremo Corte. Por causa desses fatores, sua popularidade nunca acelerou 40%. Em 2019, o Supremo Corte do Brasil lançou Lula da prisão e depois anulou suas convicções, permitindo ele correr de novo em 2022. Essa candidatura é uma candidatura que tem um objetivo fundamental para recuperar esse país. Lula também se posicionou como candidato pro democracia no concurso. Ele trabalhou para formar outra coalição forte e diversa de todo o espectro político. Lula fez uma fronte que talvez não possa ser mais breva. Oito candidatos de presidente de esquerda e direita, uma grande parte da comunidade de trabalho. Lula até acreditou evangelicals por campanhar nas igrejas. Ao mesmo tempo, Bolsonaro inicia programas de reforma social para atingir os brasileiros de classe de trabalho e de renda, que geralmente estão alinhados com Lula. Mas, quando a eleição de 2022 se aproximou, a estratégia de Lula parece estar trabalhando mais do que os bolsonaros. Os votos são spot-on em relação a Lula. Lula terminou a primeira corrida com cerca de 48% do voto, mas eles estavam tão errado sobre Bolsonaro. Lula ainda ganhou a primeira corrida, mas Bolsonaro desempenhou todos os votos que iam para a eleição. E a maior surpresa foi no Congresso do Brasil, onde os candidatos de direita, alinhados com Bolsonaro, ganham a maioria. Então, mesmo se Lula for ganhar a presidência, ele vai enfrentar uma oposição mais forte do que nunca. Lula fez muitas comitências. É preciso ver como ele vai poder implementar isso. Isso é uma força que precisa ser reconhecida, é parte da política principal brasileira e vamos continuar assim para os anos que vem.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1399\n","\n","Link  127 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/0-nthHT-J1k\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/0-nthHT-J1k\n","[youtube] 0-nthHT-J1k: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 0-nthHT-J1k: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 7.26MiB in 02:24\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  I've just arrived at the most dangerous place to be a pedestrian in the U.S. U.S. 19 in Newport, Ritchie, Florida, on the state's Gulf Coast. A group of urban planners looked at the entire U.S. roadway network and identified 60 pedestrian fatality hot spots, 1,000-meter corridors where pedestrian deaths are most common. And this 1,000-meter stretch topped their list. 17 fatal crashes here in a 16-year study window. Pedestrian fatalities in the U.S. have been creeping up in the past decade, thanks mostly to the way road infrastructure favors cars above all else. And nowhere is that more clear than right here. U.S. 19 runs north to south down Florida's Gulf Coast and bisects the small community of Newport, Ritchie, cutting off its downtown from its coastal features, which means traveling east to west or vice versa requires you to cross it. It's a type of roadway that would feel familiar to Americans. Car culture is visible everywhere, from the volume of drivers to the businesses alongside it. And along U.S. 19, drivers are moving fast. The posted speed limit on this stretch is 45 miles per hour, but driving speeds appear to be much faster than that. Traffic safety experts will tell you that speed is one of the most important factors in pedestrian safety. A street design report established that traveling up to 15 miles per hour, drivers have a wide peripheral vision. They only need 25 feet to come to a full stop, and the risk of fatality if they hit someone is 2%. Once drivers are traveling over 40 miles per hour, their peripheral view narrows. They require more room to stop, and the risk of fatality climbs to 85%. Enforcing speed limits can only do so much. The built environment, as we'd call it, is sending a message that this is for high-speed travel. Robert Schneider led the pedestrian safety study that found that 97% of the roadways with high pedestrian fatalities had multiple lanes. At its widest, U.S. 19 spans eight lanes, which allows cars to pass and move faster than if they were stuck behind another car in a single lane. And the road is straight as an arrow, no curves that would nudge drivers to take it slow. The type of businesses along U.S. 19 support a car-first, fast-driving environment, big box doors and strip malls that sit far away from the road with large parking lots in between, and billboards displayed up high for an audience of fast drivers rather than at human scale. Arterial roads like U.S. 19, not quite a street, but not quite a highway, were built to keep this high-speed traffic off of nearby residential neighborhoods. But this type of sprawling development grew along arterial roads, creating a dangerous mix of car-centric design with the possibility that pedestrians, cyclists, or public transit users would want to access these business centers. And it explains why arterial roads only make up 13% of U.S. roadways, but are the site of 59% of pedestrian deaths. Now let's relate that to U.S. 19's pedestrian design, or lack thereof. Not everyone can or wants to drive, but they still have to get to where they're going. So it's not wise to drive. Every single day, I am afraid of either getting bumped or yelled at or honked at or cut off every day. As a pedestrian trying to cross the road, I'd have to choose between this crosswalk or this one, which is nearly 950 meters away. That's a 30- or 40-minute walk, a distance so far that it encourages risky jaywalking. There's a better term for that, it turns out. Cross at a location where there's no signal. In the profession, we tend to try to say that jaywalk is a term that was developed by the auto interests in the early 1900s to essentially shame people who were crossing in the middle of the block, which had been okay socially prior to the 1920s, 1930s. The sidewalks are constantly interrupted by the curb cuts into parking lots, which introduce more opportunities to interact with a moving car without a signal. I first tried this crosswalk, waited for 10 minutes only to find out it didn't work. So I tried the next crossing. Robert Schneider told me that the longer you wait at a crosswalk, the more pedestrians are incentivized to cross before the signal. Finally, once you do cross, you have to traverse the length of eight lanes, which puts U.S. 19 in the company of 70 percent of the hot spot roadways in Robert Schneider's study that force pedestrians to cross five or more lanes. And all of this is so much more treacherous when there's less light. There's a concept in urbanism called safety in numbers. The more pedestrians there are in an environment, the safer it is to be one. There aren't many pedestrians along U.S. 19, which makes the high number of fatalities even more alarming. The lower the median household income in a neighborhood, the more common it is for pedestrian fatalities to occur there. And that's because bad street design and arterial roads like U.S. 19 are more likely to exist in those communities. Improving pedestrian design would invite more people to walk, making it safer for people who have no other choice. Florida transportation officials are spending millions to improve this stretch of U.S. 19, like reducing the speed limit, adding more crosswalks, adding more lights and delaying green lights at intersections. The mayor of Newport, Richie told me he favors adding pedestrian and cyclist bridges here to get people off the road entirely. These are expensive solutions and unpopular among drivers, but not nearly as hard as the long term goal, which is undoing decades of car centric design, like removing lanes, adding street parking instead, and developing retail and housing and parking lots, a built environment that will get more people on foot, more drivers to slow down and will save lives. It's not a quick solution, but something we need to actually be starting to move towards rather than continuing to build the sprawling development that we know is dangerous. This video is an adaptation of a Vox.com story by reporter Maren Cogan. Local officials and journalists have credited her reporting for raising awareness about pedestrian safety along this deadly stretch of road. I highly recommend you check out her story that I linked in the description below.

Killed at least 40 Indian soldiers here in Kashmir. The deadliest attack the region has seen this century. The bomber was part of an Islamic militant group based in Pakistan. Jaish-e-Muhammad claimed responsibility for that attack. 12 days later, India carried out airstrikes in northwestern Pakistan. Then Pakistan shot down at least one Indian aircraft around here. Tensions rose between the two rival nations. You can escalate. To escalate. Serious escalation in years. Kashmir is one of the most disputed places on earth. Over the course of 70 years, it's been at the center of three wars. Fought between two massive armies. It's heavily occupied by more than half a million Indian troops. And a deadly collection of militias and terrorist groups. Kashmir is the stage for the relentless conflict between India and Pakistan. But focusing on these two countries can obscure what's really at stake. The voice of Kashmiris who are caught in a vicious cycle of violence. Whenever there is any conflict between India and Pakistan, Kashmir is always the battleground. Kashmir is a disputed area. It neither belongs to India nor belongs to Pakistan. Two giants, nuclear giants, we are nothing in between them. There is always uncertainty. You know, you never know what is going to happen. It can be a hartaal, it can be a strike, it can be, anybody can be killed anytime. We are the pawns in their hands. It's a mess. It is a mess and we have been affected in every possible direct and indirect way. I have been born in a country where there is no conflict. I have been born in this conflict and I have to die within this conflict. Kashmir is one of the most strategic places in the world, where three powerful countries collide. India, Pakistan and China. China invaded and took this slice of Kashmir from India and was given this one by Pakistan. India and Pakistan control these parts but lay claim to more. This region is at the center of a brutal conflict over these disputed borders. So it's important to start when the borders were being drawn. In the mid-1800s, India was a patchwork of several hundred provinces and princely states under British rule. A century later, when British India won independence, the British left and hastily decided to split the region into two. These areas would be a new Muslim-majority country, Pakistan. And this would be the mostly Hindu-Mohi region. And this would be the mostly Hindu but secular India. The partition was bloody. Communal hatred flares up in the Punjab. One million people become refugees overnight. They flee from savagery and butchery that has never been exceeded even in India's stormy history. Amid the chaos, some princely states were given the choice to join either country. In most cases, the ruling monarchs followed the will of their people. But this state, called Jammu and Kashmir, was different. It was right along this new border, and had a Muslim-majority population, but was ruled by a Hindu monarch. When asked to pick a side, the ruler chose to stay neutral. Fearing that the monarch would join India, the Kashmiri population rebelled here in 1947. Armed tribesmen from Pakistan soon joined the fight. The monarch turned to India for military help, and in exchange agreed to join them, which sparked the first Indo-Pakistan war in Kashmir. Continuing bus increase the threat to world peace, and brought the dispute to the attention of the United Nations. The UN Security Council brokered a ceasefire in 1949, which established this line, with Pakistan controlling this side, and India this one. It also asked Pakistani tribesmen to withdraw, and Indian troops to follow, so that Kashmir could hold a direct vote to decide its own future. But neither held up their end of the deal. Pakistan argued that Kashmir's Muslim-majority population rightfully belonged with them, while India insisted that Kashmir was handed over to them by the Hindu monarch, so they doubled down and added Kashmir to their constitution. The vote was never held. I think every person in Kashmir has been affected by India and Pakistan. The Kashmir is completely destroyed by India as well as by Pakistan. This is a territorial dispute, they call it. They don't need people. The main stakeholders are the Kashmiris. Their opinions are not being heard. Both countries continued to tighten their grip around it for decades. Kashmir fighting is going on, and heavy casualties in men and equipment have been inflicted on the aggressor. In 1965, the second Indo-Pakistan war broke out in Kashmir. Thousands of people were killed between the huge armies on both sides. A ceasefire ended the war, but didn't change this line. Kashmir was kept divided and occupied. Another war broke out in 1971. This time the focus wasn't in Kashmir, it was in East Pakistan. Here, India helped rebels fight for independence and dealt Pakistan a devastating defeat. This region became a new country, Bangladesh, and Pakistan lost its eastern half. This made Kashmir more important than ever. It became one of the most militarized places on earth as India and Pakistan deployed planes, tanks, artillery, and soldiers along the line of control. On the political front, in 1987, India reportedly rigged an election, declaring a pro-India party as the winner. Now this was a big turning point for many Kashmiris, who felt they were again denied the chance to vote. Thousands took to the streets in Indian-controlled Kashmir to protest the occupation. But India met the movement for independence with harsh resistance, which quickly escalated to more violence. In January, security forces opened fire on demonstrating separatists, turning a two-year-old struggling movement into a full-blown popular uprising. More than 650 people have been killed in clashes between troops and separatists. Kashmiri militias like the Jammu and Kashmir Liberation Front started recruiting Muslim youth to fight for independence, and increasingly attacked the Indian military. Pakistan saw an opportunity in this insurgency. They helped introduce a new kind of militant group, radical Islamic fighters who fought for more pro-Pakistan Kashmir. By the mid-90s, these groups dominated the insurgency. India responded with incredible military force, deploying 500,000 troops to Kashmir. And they cracked down on militants and protesters. Unarmed civilians were killed, and many were forced to flee the violence. And in 98, the stakes were raised yet again. Today, India conducted three underground nuclear tests. Pakistan today successfully conducted five nuclear tests. Kashmir became a battleground between two nuclear armed nations. And another war broke out in 1999. More evidence of the attacks being launched on the Indian-controlled area of Karachi. The past two days have seen some of the fiercest fighting so far. Militant Muslim fighters have also crossed over into some parts of Indian-ruled Kashmir. The 1999 war ended with another ceasefire, but that didn't stop either country. Over the years, Pakistan's militant groups got bolder and launched terror attacks in and outside of Kashmir. In 2001, members of Lashkar-e-Taiba bombed India's parliament building in New Delhi, killing more than 300 people. And in 2008, 10 militants from the same group killed 174 people and wounded 300 in Mumbai. Meanwhile, Indian military cracked down in Kashmir, firing bullets and pellets on unarmed protesters, leaving hundreds wounded and blind. This is the vicious cycle of violence. The Indian army's crackdown drives some Kashmiris to join Pakistani-backed militant groups who carry a heavy load of weapons and weapons. And to join Pakistani-backed militant groups who carry out violence against the Indian forces. It's a cycle that Kashmiri civilians are stuck in the middle of. Which brings us back to 2019. The suicide bomber was 19-year-old Adil Ahmed Dar from Pulwama, Kashmir. According to his parents, in 2016, Indian police officers stopped him and humiliated him by forcing his face into the ground. The same year he was shot in the leg at a protest. The next year, Dar left home with his brothers to join Jaish-e-Muhammad, a Pakistani-supported militia that radicalized him and trained him to be a suicide bomber. A year later, he drove explosives into an Indian military convoy. For more than 70 years, India and Pakistan have driven a cycle of violence, retaliation, and exploitation in Kashmir. But beneath it all is the Kashmiris' wish to make a choice. A wish that continues to be suppressed again and again by violence. Dreams are suppressed here.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1417\n","\n","Link  129 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/-CxycfPGuxg\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/-CxycfPGuxg\n","[youtube] -CxycfPGuxg: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] -CxycfPGuxg: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 7.76MiB in 01:44\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Well, day two of testimony wrapped up on Friday in the double murder trial of Alex Murdoch, the disbarred and disgraced South Carolina attorney charged with killing his wife and son. Excuse me, Murdoch has not, has pleaded not guilty. Here's CNN's correspondent, Ranny K., with more on what we heard from Murdoch on the night of the killings. We had a wonderful marriage, wonderful relationship. And yours and Paul's relationship? As good as it could be. This is Alec Murdoch being interviewed in the investigator's car hours after his wife and son were murdered. I mean, I pulled up and I could see him. I could see it was. And I could see his brain on. And I ran over to Maggie and actually, I think I tried to turn Paul over first. I tried to take their pulse on both of them. And you know, I called 9-1-1 pretty much right away. That conversation took place at nearly 1 a.m. on June 8th, 2021. For the first time, we hear him explain how he says he tried to reach his wife and son with no luck. I got up, I called Maggie. Couldn't get an answer. And I think I texted her. And she's very good about answering the phone. So that was odd or calling me back. So that was odd, but it wasn't that big a deal. I texted her at 9-0-8, going to check on him, be right back. And then I texted her at 9-47. That must be when I started to come back. I think I called her before that. But let me make sure. Pretty sure that I called her 9-45. And then I tried Paul. Alec Murdoch told investigators that he tried to check the pulse on both his wife, Maggie, and son, Paul. Yet Alec didn't appear to have any blood on him, this investigator told the court. Did you see anything that appeared to be blood on his skin? I did not. Did you see what appeared to be blood on Alec Murdoch's hands? I did not. And when the defense lawyer asked her why she thought his clothes were freshly washed. He's sweating and they are dry, so I would say yes. Still, on cross-examination, the defense tried to poke holes in the idea that Alec Murdoch may have washed his clothes after allegedly killing his wife and son. Well let me ask you, in your mind's eye, that night on June 7th, did he look like someone had just blown his son's head off, spattered going everywhere? Again, I can't say that for sure. Also in court, a crime scene investigator at one point pulled out Paul Murdoch's bloody sneakers that he was wearing the night he was killed. That was certainly a dramatic moment. And that same witness who was testifying for the state said that investigators didn't search Alec Murdoch's home until September 13th, 2021. That would have been more than three months after the double murder. No doubt the defense, when it does cross-examination on Monday, will use that to continue its theme of an alleged sloppy investigation. Amara? Wow. So many fascinating details there. Randy Kaye, thank you for your reporting. Joey Jackson is a criminal defense attorney and CNN legal analyst. Joey, I know you've been quite busy, so thank you so much for joining us this morning. First off, Joey, I mean, it seems like there is a lot of smoke there. What did you make, first of all, what we heard from that officer who was first to respond at the murder scene and how he said that Alec Murdoch didn't cry when he saw him and that he immediately offered up a possible motive? Yeah, Amara, good morning to you. You know, this is a tough case in general, I think, for the prosecution in as much as we are in a really DNA era, right? We're in an era where people need to see, jurors need to see, know, and observe in the event someone's guilty. In this particular case, just broadly speaking before the specifics of your question, you look and you say, well, is there any surveillance which would indicate that he did it? Well, no. Are there any eyewitnesses that would indicate that he did it? Well, no. Is there anything else that you could suggest where other than circumstantial evidence to say that he actually is the one who is responsible answered no. And so then you go to the specifics and you ask me the question with respect to as we look there that he's charged with the murder of his son and his wife, right? The victim was found shot to death in the family property June of 2021. And of course, he's pleaded not guilty. But people have different ways of which they respond, Amara, in the event, for example, of a death, right? You cross examine someone, you indicate that he wasn't crying, but you did say that he seemed upset. Is there a standard way in which someone should react in a situation like this? Would you believe the two people might respond the same or may they respond differently? So it's always tough to make judgments with respect to the demeanor, the comportment and the attitude of someone in a horrific situation to the extent, Amara, that everyone is different. So that in and of itself, my answer is not outcome determinative as to his guilt. What about this question about why he didn't have any blood on his clothes or his hands, even though Alex Murdoch said that he checked the pulse of his wife and son? How do you explain that? Yeah, so, you know, that could be problematic in as much as you could say one of two things, right? You could say that he didn't have it in as much as he wiped it off, right? That's what the prosecution is alluding to, the fact that he tried to clean himself up. But then on the other hand, right, you're the police, you've conducted an investigation. Did you attempt to make any effort to determine whether there was blood you didn't see? Did you do any other investigation to see whether or not there was blood at any other parts of his body? Did you get a warrant to make an assessment as to his home or anything else? Did you look at other areas for which you might suggest that he could have wiped the blood off? Did you find a cloth? Did you do anything else? And so I think that there's always two narratives, just like your other question, was he setting up an alibi? Well, maybe instead of setting up an alibi, he was simply trying to determine what was going on and giving you information so that you officers could get to the bottom of it. Maybe instead of wiping off blood, right, he actually just based upon where the spatter was, there was not the blood and that particular location, right, of the wrist or where he was trying to do it. So there's innocent explanations and then there are nefarious explanations. Trials, Amar, are about the prosecution pointing to the nefarious and the defense pointing to the innocent and the jury making a determination as to which of those two narratives makes sense. Okay. So there's an uphill battle in terms of proving with evidence for prosecutors. What do you expect the defense to do or what would their strategy will be? Yeah, I think they'll continue to pound on what they have. I mean, the fact is, is that what type of investigation did you do? Where is the specific proof in the evidence? Where is the connection to him? That is Alex Murdoch. What is the motivation as to why he would do this? How are you suggesting without evidence with respect to eyewitnesses that he did, without surveillance that he did, without blood on his, all about his body part? Now look, here's the point. When you heard the cross-examination that we did of his defense attorney, Amar, he was pointing out that in the event that there's splatter and some, you know, I mean, it's pretty graphic that I won't get into, but if people, you're shooting him in the head area, you would expect blood to splatter. So was it on his shirt? Was it on his face? What is on his pants? Did you make any analysis? Did you make any assessment? So what do we have? Circumstantial evidence because you think he's guilty? That's not enough, ladies and gentlemen. I think that's where the defense will go and continue to hammer away in the case.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1465\n","\n","Link  130 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/CLjxsWhdEY0\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/CLjxsWhdEY0\n","[youtube] CLjxsWhdEY0: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] CLjxsWhdEY0: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 6.98MiB in 01:45\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  And what many feared would be a night of violence was largely peaceful with protests across the country in New York. Three people were arrested, one for breaking the windshield of a patrol car. But overall, what we saw were calm and peaceful protests. Emra, I want to bring in CNN Sarah Seidner to this conversation here in Memphis and Sarah, you spent the night with protesters. You visited the scene where we watched that horrible video where all of that unfolded. When you were with the protesters, they got on the interstate. What were they sharing with you? What were they calling? You know, they wanted people to see them and see what had happened here and make sure that the community, not just here, but around the country, understood that there is a problem with policing on that. They wanted to see changes, and they talked about whether or not they were satisfied, I guess, if you will, with the charges, satisfied with the response from the police department. First, the firings of the officers, which came very swiftly on then these ex charges, which included second degree murder, aggravated kidnapping, aggravated assault. But you know, when they saw the video, they just felt there's so much more that has happened before this that could have stopped this. And so they're unsatisfied with what has happened here. I know everyone has been praising the police chief and praising the D. A. For going forward with charges so quickly because that is unusual. And we've seen many cases where it's taken up to a year for anything to happen and sometimes nothing at all. But when they saw the video and they knowing what has happened to some of them in the past with their interactions with police, they were unsatisfied. They said this should never have happened. And because things weren't done before this happened to some of these units, like the Scorpio unit. We have this situation where a 29 year old who was a free spirit ends up losing his life. So there was anger, there was frustration, there was a lot of pain, but there was no destruction. There was no violence. They disrupted traffic. They moved on after an hour or so. And that was the end of it. It has been a very peaceful, mostly prayerful time here in Memphis, but they want to see major reforms and they want to see it now. Yeah. And the family's attorney Ben Crumb pointed out that only a few days before the incident with Tyree, another person in this community had complained about that Scorpion unit saying that they had used excessive force on him. What is the sense that you're getting from the community and from leaders in the community about how likely change is to come? Well, we're getting a clue when it comes to particularly the Scorpion unit. The police chief has basically put that unit on hold. The unit was put in place for crime suppression. The family and their attorneys say it turned into oppression of citizens. They were just sort of after people in their minds looking for people as suspects instead of looking at people as citizens. And so right now that has been put on hold. What the family is asking for is that and their attorneys is that they disband this group altogether. Whether or not that will happen, we do not know. But there is sort of an investigation they put on hold underway on and you may see more people either lose their jobs or be put on administrative leave beside those two sheriff's deputies because I think we counted more than nine people who were out there at the time. There's also the question that sticks in everyone's mind. The fire members of the fire department who were there. Um, they are there not as law enforcement. They are there to save lives and help. And if that's not what they did and just stood around, then that is why they have been, you know, sort of they haven't been fired yet because they have to go through a process. But there is a lot of questions that sort of the duty to intervene and the duty to do their work to try to save someone. So there's a lot of questions here. Imagine you're a person going through this and the people sent there to be the rescue, do nothing. Um, that really hurt a lot of people as well. It was one of the most painful parts of watching all of that footage that as they're holding on to him and beating him when he presents no threat to any of the officers around him, nobody intervenes and then he's just slumped over and it appears negligent. It appears that they're not actually tending to him as they're talking about what happened. Sarah, I'm curious to get your perspective on this because as we noted before and we were talking to defense attorney Shan Wu earlier this morning, um, he makes the case that there was nothing in the footage that shows, uh, a provocation or a threat that Tyree posed at any moment. In fact, if this was a traffic stop, why are they pulling him out of the car to begin with? Right? Um, have you gotten any indication from perhaps law enforcement or from defense attorneys that there might be some explanation for how aggravated the officers were as they approached the scene? The simple answer to that is no from the D. A. No, from the police chief. They have not found evidence leading up to this to in any way, shape or form, um, that there was a reckless driving and be any reason for this to get so hot so fast and be so aggressive. What you do here on the tape is officers sound very angry when they pepper spray because the pepper spray bows back in their face and they blame it on Tyree Nichols, not on themselves. The ones that sprayed the pepper spray so close up, they blame it both two officers. You hear them blaming Tyree Nichols for this. So you could hear the sort of swell, the heightened emotions and one person described this as in their minds. They looked like a pack of wolves. The group mentality happened. There was a gang mentality that happened and they just all of them in a fury went after him and you can hear him saying you're doing too much. Like what are you doing? What did I do when he's screaming for his mother and this will sit with me for the rest of my life when he's screaming for his mom and saying it over and over again. She's about 80 yards away, she said, and she truly believes he actually was hoping she could hear him and she couldn't be there for her son in his last moments and that will never leave her mind. And she says, I don't even know how to process that. Yeah. And who would right before we go, Sarah, I just want to make sure that for viewers who have watched that footage, it's agonizing, but we do want to share who Tyree Nichols was and paint him in a different light than just the person that the victim that you see in that footage. You mentioned that he was a free spirit. His mom talks about him being a photographer who would like to photograph sunsets. She said that he was a skater. What else stands out to you when you hear those details from his family? You know, we went and looked. He has a photography site where he would regularly go out and take beautiful pictures of Memphis. But when the sun is setting on and they are beautiful pictures, he had. That was his passion. He was working at FedEx. He was working, by the way, with his father. They both worked at FedEx. And the thing that also stuck with me is that he would come home almost every night for dinner with his family. He'd walk in and say, Hi, family. And she says, I'll never hear that again. And I don't know how to live with that. That is such a painful note. Sarah, thank you so much. We know there might be demonstrations later, so look forward to reporting on that. Always appreciate being alongside the sports.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1423\n","\n","Link  131 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/Fn-2v-P9YSo\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fn-2v-P9YSo\n","[youtube] Fn-2v-P9YSo: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] Fn-2v-P9YSo: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 23.40MiB in 05:18\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  For more than 40 years, CNN has offered a front row seat to history in the making. Why am I under arrest? It's a hoax, a set up. Join us as we turn back the clock. Two explosions. Osama bin Laden. And watch the stories that have defined our time. There are no words. This is CNN's Rewind. It was January 1986. Americans had just been introduced to Nintendo. Back to the Future was in theatres. And the Cold War was beginning to warm up. Meanwhile, NASA's shuttle programme was bringing the dream of space travel closer to home. We're here today to announce the first private citizen passenger in the history of space flight. But on a cold January morning, disaster would ground the ambitions of space flight for years to come. Four, three, two, one. And on. Oh my goodness. The space race began in earnest after World War II. Both the United States and the Soviet Union perfected rockets and missiles. From the beginning, the space programme was more than a scientific experiment. It was a matter of national pride and national security. With the U.S. on top in the space race, NASA let military considerations take a back seat and concentrated on science. But now, Congress wanted to return on their space investment. Billions of dollars had been poured into the NASA project. The 70s found NASA researchers back at the drawing board, working almost nonstop to develop this space vehicle that could be launched into space and returned much like an airplane. On November 24, 1980, the first space shuttle rolled out of the hangar. Its name? Columbia. It marked a new era in space exploration. Since then, three other shuttle crafts have been built. Challenger, Discovery and Atlantis. Today I'm directing NASA to begin a search in all of our elementary and secondary schools and to choose as the first citizen passenger in the history of our space programme, one of America's finest, a teacher. Applications to be the first civilian in space will be distributed through all U.S. public, private and parochial schools. NASA officials will select one civilian astronaut and one backup for several months of pre-flight training. The teacher who will be going into space, Krista McAuliffe. Where is that you? McAuliffe was faced with training. She clearly relished the challenge. She said she hoped to inspire others to reach out and try new and different things. One of the things that I would like to do when I go aboard the shuttle is to bring back the wonder of it all. Just seeing Mr. McAuliffe like outreaching our yard or something, not floating around in space. First it was the wind, then it was a frozen bolt, then it was the wind again. As a result, the space shuttle Challenger is still sitting on launch pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center. The weather once again ruining NASA's show. What the country's space agency has learned in recent weeks as well as the rest of this is that this is a difficult general time of year to try and launch a space shuttle. Patience has been a key element around the NASA operation all this week. We're going to join Tom and Tere now. Once again, just getting down to about three minutes and they think they can do it. They are counting, the ice is cleared away and Challenger should be going away very soon. Let's go down to the Kennedy Space Center and take a look at Challenger sitting on the pad as they continue the countdown. They started the auxiliary power units about a minute ago and that is one of the major milestones to continuing the countdown. Gimble checks now complete. During the six days in space, the astronauts are going to release a $100 million satellite and another one called Haley Spartan that will study the comet. But the highlight on this mission is the including in the flight of Krista McAuliffe, a 37-year-old high school social studies teacher from Concord, New Hampshire. She will teach from space on Friday now. If they are able to get off today, they will have live coverage here on CNN of her giving lessons to students on the ground. I hope it goes. T minus 15 seconds. Please go off. I want it to. T minus 10, 9, 8, 7, 6. We have main engine start, 4, 3, 2, 1 and liftoff. Liftoff of the 25th space shuttle mission and it has cleared the tower. Good roll program confirmed. Challenger now adding downrange. Engines beginning throttling down now at 94 percent. Normal throttles for most of the flight, 104 percent. Little throttle down to 65 percent shortly. Engines at 65 percent. Three engines running normally. Three good fuel cells. Three good APUs. Reliability 2257 feet per second. Altitude 4.3 nautical miles. Downrange distance 3 nautical miles. So the 25th space shuttle mission is now on the way after more delays than NASA cares to count. This morning it looked as though they were not going to be able to get off. One minute 15 seconds. Velocity 2900 feet per second. Altitude 9 nautical miles. Downrange distance 7 nautical miles. Looks like a couple of the solid rocket boosters blew away from the side of the shuttle in an explosion. The controllers here are looking very carefully at the situation. Obviously a major malfunction. We have no downlink. Oh. Oh please. Where is it? We have the explosion on tape here. All right. Oh goodness. We're awaiting word they're holding their breath just I'm sure as everyone else is. You saw it just a few moments ago about 45 seconds after liftoff. A huge fireball in the sky. We have a report from the flight dynamics officer that the vehicle has exploded. Flight director confirms that we are looking at checking with the recovery forces to see what can be done at this point. Contingency procedures are in effect. What appears to be a major catastrophe in America's space program. Challenger only seconds after leaving the launch pad according to NASA has exploded in midair. No word yet on if there are any survivors. You can see what appears to be a ship off of the Kennedy Space Center. Just saw a splash in the water. No if that was one of the solid rocket boosters or part of the shuttle. On board the space shuttle this morning commander Francis Dix Scobie, co-pilot Michael Smith, Judith Breznik, Ronald McNair, Jeffrey Jarvis and Christian McAuliffe and Ellison Azuka. Let's take another look now just seconds into the launch. This is before the solid rockets were lit. We have main engine start four three two one and liftoff. Liftoff of the 25th space shuttle mission and it has cleared the tower. Good roll program confirmed. Challenger now heading down range. Tom everything looks normal to this point. I want to see it again. Everything looks normal to this point. It's when the long range tracking cameras took over and you could see an extreme close up as the solid rocket boosters appeared to be breaking away from the shuttle and then explode. It comes up in just a few seconds here. You could see right before the explosion at the external tank where it attaches to the shuttle a flame appeared to break out between the external tank and the shuttle. Tom this has never happened before. I know you are aware that there are contingency plans for such an event. Because it's never happened before I think possibly many people even involved are not aware of what they are. Do they have ships standing by? There are recovery ships standing by and they do go through procedures for launch abort. There is worst case scenario. We have CNN's John Zarella who is at the Kennedy Space Center on the live line now. John you could I'm sure see it from your vantage point even nine miles down. Describe the scene there. Here now at the Kennedy Space Center everybody is just stunned. They are in shock. It's a situation where people are just sort of standing around in you know just bewilderment at this point and of course we are not getting any information from here any more than what you are. We are just seeing just what we have just witnessed and what we have seen is tragic, tragic incident. Well the explosion that we saw just a few minutes ago we are back now to a live picture from a helicopter above the launch area. This is mission control in Houston. For the last four or five minutes the audio channel from mission control has been silent. Not a single word has been spoken while the rescue efforts if there are any to be made are underway. Let's go to the White House now and Larry speaks. We are shocked at what he has just seen replayed on television concerning the shuttle launch. We do not have any more information than is being provided to the public at this time. The way the president found out about it is he was in the Oval Office. The vice president and the foreign policy advisor John Poindexter came in with others and informed the president that the news had just broken. We immediately adjourned our Oval Office meeting and went into an adjoining room. The president studied where there is a television and the president then began to review television reports of the explosion there shortly after the launch. So once again the president is concerned, he is saddened, he is very anxious to have more information on it at the moment as I say we are learning most of our information from what the public is getting. Is there anything said about the fact that the teacher was on board this plane? Well it was something that was on all of our minds that we did have the first teacher in space, really the first civilian so to speak other than our members of Congress who have flown in space and certainly that is on our mind. Tom, we have just learned from a wire report that the students at Christa McAuliffe's High School in New Hampshire were watching the liftoff along with hundreds of thousands of other Americans. Students filled the Concord High School auditorium to watch the launch. As Challenger lifted off they shouted clap blue horns. At first few realized what had happened, then the fact that what began as a joyous event had turned to tragedy hit them. They said on TV that it blew up and everybody started crying and that's when I realized what happened. The word of the Challenger catastrophe struck Washington like a winter thunderbolt. The House of Representatives was in session at 1138 Eastern Time this morning but not for long the House Chaplain very quickly upon learning of the news offered a prayer for those off the coast of Florida. James Ford presented the wishes and the will of the House to a chilled and cold House of Representatives. And at this special moment let us remember in silent prayer those who were involved in the spacecraft shuttle accident just a few minutes ago off Florida. Let us pray. Then the speaker Tip O'Neill. Hi. Bob when we come back to you I want to take a pause for 10 seconds of silence. We'll go to out of 14 and 10 seconds of silence and you can say that if you want to. As far as it affects the nation's capital now Bob. Thank you Reed and we will pause now at CNN in our coverage for 10 seconds of silence. Three minutes before launch time correspondent Tom Menteer joined us on the set to begin our live coverage of the launch. Tom. Bob the only concern that NASA really showed this morning was with the icicles some of them two foot long and it might be proper to go back and look and think about the situation with that. They were very concerned they called an emergency meeting at the John Kennedy Space Center to discuss whether the ice on the pad area could possibly damage the shuttle on liftoff. NASA has never gone through ice in the launch pad area before and they decided at that meeting that it posed no danger and they went ahead with the countdown. Associate Administrator Jess Moore previously when pressured about NASA being so far behind schedule this year already with two missions only flown stated emphatically that we will never compromise safety standards for schedule. Those were his words just a few days ago. Charles of course the president has a public duty to perform tonight his State of the Union address at 9 Eastern Time. It seems does it not almost inevitable that this is going to cast a long and mournful shadow over even that. The president had hoped to make the kind of speech that was being described here as visionary laying out his hopes for this country through the into the next century. I think it is fair to guess in fact Mr. Speaks sort of indicated that the president would be compelled to have something to say about this tragedy and I think we will hear that tonight yes it does indeed cast a pall on this event. Among the Americans who saw the devastation that struck America's space program and seven people aboard the space shuttle were the husband of 37 year old New Hampshire school teacher Krista McAuliffe and her nine year old daughter. Also at the Cape or just actually three and a half miles from the Cape watching as it happened this morning where Krista McAuliffe's two parents Edward and Grace Corrigan were watching from a VIP area some three and a half miles away. The wire services are reported serving the two of them hugging and sobbing as they saw the explosion aboard the shuttle. These are the spectators that were watching. This is raw unedited video just sent via satellite. Picture you were just seeing is Krista McAuliffe's parents watching in horror. These are the students from her school. Many of them probably had their view block just as we did with the television cameras, with just a huge fireball and a huge cloud of smoke. They may not realize yet what has happened. You see concern etched on their faces. The breath that they've been holding released and then the realization sets in that something is wrong. At that point all that remained was... The families of the astronauts normally in the grandstands. Tom as John Zarrella pointed out from the cave earlier when all of us first saw the blast there was a moment of stunned silence and disbelief. Many people perhaps did confuse it with the...is it the booster rockets? The solid rocket booster separation which occurs a little later. It was far too early. And far too big an explosion. Tom, the area that we were just watching...That is the VIP section, invited guests for this launch. I myself received an invitation from Michael Smith who was the pilot on this flight to sit in these same bleachers and to watch his launch. Michael Smith has been a guest here on CNN before on our launch coverage and sent me a special invitation to go. That would then include family members of the astronauts. It includes family members, school children from New Hampshire. Ladies and gentlemen, I'd planned to speak to you tonight to report on the state of the Union. But the events of earlier today have led me to change those plans. Today is a day for mourning and remembering. 19 years ago, almost to the day, we lost three astronauts in a terrible accident on the ground. But we've never lost an astronaut in flight. We've never had a tragedy like this. And perhaps we've forgotten the courage it took for the crew of the shuttle. But they, the Challenger Seven, were aware of the dangers, overcame them and did their jobs brilliantly. We mourn seven heroes. We mourn their loss as a nation together. The families of the Seven, we cannot bear as you do the full impact of this tragedy. But we feel the loss and we're thinking about you so very much. Your loved ones were daring and brave. And they had that special grace, that special spirit that says, give me a challenge and I'll meet it with joy. They had a hunger to explore the universe and discover its truths. They wished to serve and they did. They served all of us. And I want to say something to the school children of America who were watching the live coverage of the shuttle's takeoff. I know it's hard to understand, but sometimes painful things like this happen. It's all part of the process of exploration and discovery. It's all part of taking a chance and expanding man's horizons. The future doesn't belong to the faint-hearted. It belongs to the brave. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future and we'll continue to follow them. The shuttle's busiest schedule ever will be delayed while investigators figure out what went wrong. The Challenger would have flown successfully if the weather at Cape Canaveral had been warm. NASA was not communicating with itself and was keeping some problems secret from top management. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future and we'll continue to follow them. The Challenger crew was pulling us into the future and we'll continue to follow them.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 2953\n","\n","Link  132 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/aTgf85t57Sg\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/aTgf85t57Sg\n","[youtube] aTgf85t57Sg: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] aTgf85t57Sg: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 5.03MiB in 01:06\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  So Ron would have not been governor if it wasn't for me, and that's OK. And number one, he wouldn't have gotten a nomination. And number two, he wouldn't have beaten his Democrat opponent. So then when I hear he might run, you know, I consider that very disloyal, but it's not about loyalty. But to me it is. It's always about loyalty. But for a lot of people, it's not about loyalty. Are you surprised to see him openly criticizing DeSantis this early? What do you think? No, I'm not surprised. If you think back on the 16 primary, he was taking shots at everybody in the race, even people who were at 0 and 1 percent. In the case of DeSantis, there are a lot of polls where DeSantis is ahead of Donald Trump, including in key early states. So I'm not surprised. I expect him to come after DeSantis pretty hard. You know, Trump's the only person officially in the race right now, but it sure looks like DeSantis is going to run. And if you look at the whole field, the Florida governor looks like the one who might have the reservoir of support among all corners of the party to actually beat Donald Trump in a primary. Well, then what do you make about this phone call we're learning about with Nikki Haley calling him saying she she wants to get in the race and, you know, feeling him out. And he said basically, if that's what you feel in your heart, go for it. I mean, on one hand, it really works to his advantage, right, to have as many join the race as possible. Yeah, a big field who actually stays in it through the voting helps Donald Trump in 2016. He only got about 45 percent of the Republican vote, but he won the nomination because of the winner take all system. You would just have to get the most votes in these states to get all the delegates. And so if he could get a big field that stays in it for far too long, it would really advantage him or frankly anyone who kind of carries a strong base. But it's not a majority of the party. My anticipation is the field will be smaller this time around and people will drop out earlier than they did last time. What you really need if you want to take out Donald Trump is to get it down to a one on one match with somebody that people really like. And right now it looks like the Santas is that person. Other people will give it a go. But certainly the Santas is in a is in a class by himself of the non-Trump candidates. Yeah. And on that note, I mean, we've been seeing some interesting polling data out of those key early primary states. Ron DeSantis coming in well ahead of Trump among Republicans in New Hampshire, leading the former president by a full 12 points. There are similar numbers there in South Carolina. I mean, with numbers like that, Scott is Trump losing his title as the party's 2024 front runner. I think he is still probably the front runner if you take all the metrics into account. Money organization, you know, a cadre of people who are fully dependent upon him for their livelihoods. I mean, he still is a quite a formidable candidate. So I guess nominally, he's the front runner. And plus, there are no other candidates technically at the moment. But you can't look at this polling if you're on this and not be fully intrigued by where you stand. You've done nothing. You've not filed a committee. All you've done is run for reelection and trounce your Democrat opponent. And yet you are right here in the driver's seat of the candidates who want to take on and maybe take out Donald Trump. So I expect him to run and I think he's going to be quite popular. I've seen a lot of polling, Pamela, from around the country in different states, private polling. I got to tell you, Trump's still popular. DeSantis is just as popular, but he doesn't have nearly the amount of detractors inside the party that Trump does. Yeah. I mean, even just anecdotally in our home state of Kentucky, when I was talking to folks there recently, there was a theme of folks who used to support Trump saying, I'd like to see Ron DeSantis get in this race. I'd like to see him run. But, you know, at the same time, you've got to look at the reality here, right? And what Trump did the last time and what he is capable of doing again. Matthew Contenetti has an interesting piece in The Free Beacon where he warns that the U.S. political class is behaving alarmingly similar to how they did in the run up to 2016, writing, once again, Trump's opponents think he will just disappear. No Republican wants to attack him directly. But the only way to thwart him, Trump, is to make voters choose someone else. I mean, at what point do his challengers start challenging him? Even Ron DeSantis has been, you know, hasn't really been doing that, doing the kind of direct engagement you might expect. I would say pretty soon you're going to see people start to take further steps. I mean, for the people who are not Trump or DeSantis, one of the problems they have is figuring out, is there any oxygen for me? I mean, Trump and DeSantis take up nearly the entire, you know, oxygen in the primary right now. Everybody else is in the low single digits. Even former Vice President Pence, who's well known, is a single digit candidate right now. So I'm not sure it's as much Trump keeping them out as it is DeSantis because of how popular he is nationally with Republicans. But I agree with Matthew. At some point somebody's going to have to take him on and somebody's going to have to make Republicans choose. And I will say, I think broadly across the American electorate, in both parties there is a demand for new candidates, new blood, new generation of leadership. And the party that chooses new is going to have a huge advantage if the other party chooses old. And if I were Ron DeSantis, that's something I'd be making the case for. Democrats are going, Biden, let's pick somebody new and ride this thing and win it and put together a coalition that can carry the national popular vote. All right, Scott Jennings, nice to see you. Thank you.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1121\n","\n","Link  133 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/fucZLex1-nI\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/fucZLex1-nI\n","[youtube] fucZLex1-nI: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] fucZLex1-nI: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 9.60MiB in 02:28\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  CNN Shimon Prokupes joins us now from Memphis. I know Shimon you have been asking for days questions about the Scorpion unit. You had been told by sources that perhaps these officers were in the unit. They were short time ago. We learned that unit that these officers belong to it has been deactivated. What more can you tell us? Yeah, and certainly this is a significant move here by the police chief in Memphis to do this, and this was something that community members wanted. And of course, Ben Crump and the family of Tyree Nichols wanted. And today the police chief granting them their granting them their requests, their wishes. Let me reach you what the police chief said in her decision to do this. She says that in the process of listening intently to the family of Tyree Nichols, community leaders, and the uninvolved officers who have done quality work in their assignments, it is in the best interest of all to permanently deactivate the Scorpion unit. The officers currently assigned to the unit agree unreservedly with the next step. Now some people in this community will probably take issue with her saying that some there are doing quality work or that the unit as a whole has been doing quality work people here in the community have been complaining about the work that this unit has been doing. You know you heard Ben Crump in your interview with him tell you that they have heard from people in this community who have raised issues. Now the police chief granting the wishes of the community of these family members in disbanding this unit. Now the Scorpion Union was created to basically target violent areas of Memphis, and what it stands for is the street crimes operation to restore peace. In our neighborhood and the mayor and the police chief here launching it in November of 2021 and mostly intended to focus on homicides and robberies. They drive around and unmarked cars, and as we saw in the video, very aggressively what they did to Tyree Nichols pulling him out of the car, throwing him to the ground and Ben Crump. Of course, talking about the culture of this unit and that very much is in focus now as all of these investigations continue. Pam. Shubham, Procure Paz. Thank you so much. Well, mostly peaceful protest marches are playing out across the country for a second day. I want to check in with Polo Sandoval in New York. You've been tracking everything polo and keeping with please. Made by Nichols, mother people have refrained from the kind of response we saw after the George Floyd video was released. What have you been hearing? And based on what we're hearing from police departments throughout the country, a majority of these demonstrations that we've seen from coast to coast, we're talking Boston down to Atlanta, Los Angeles. They have remained relatively peaceful, except for perhaps a few isolated incidents that have taken place. But really what that those 21 minutes of inaction that you just mentioned, Pamela, that's certainly fueling that outrage for so many people and they're echoing Benjamin Crump's call to basically expand the scope of charges beyond those five officers. And that is why tonight we are preparing to see yet another wave of these demonstrations in cities throughout the United States. One happening as we speak here in New York City and Washington Square Park, where a group of individuals are peacefully assembling with a long line of speakers. Our affiliate at WCBS had an opportunity to speak to one of the leaders of that event that's taking place right now, just a short time ago. So we are out here to fight and call for justice once again and continuously because the work did not stop in 2020. It didn't stop in 2021 and it did not stop in 2022. We are still here and we are still fighting until justice is done. You know, having covered this before or similar situations before is a very similar message to what we've heard from demonstrators in the past, but we're also hearing that something is certainly different, that swift response that we saw from officials in Memphis when it comes to the charges. That is certainly something that many demonstrators are accepting and also police departments from around the country joining in that outrage, not just because of the actions of the officers, but of course, the inaction as well. Well, Sandoval, thank you so much. Joining us now is Tennessee Congressman Steve Cohen, whose district includes Munch of Memphis. Congressman, good to see you. You're the fourth generation of your family to call Memphis home. How is your city doing today? I think the city is doing pretty well. It's been an unnerving experience to see one of our fellow citizens who was such a nice, innocent, free spirited young man murdered by the Memphis Police Department. My first job out of law school was working as a civilian attorney for the Memphis Police Department nearly 50 years ago, and I taught officers in the academy. I worked on cases that were disciplinary actions and so I know the police department. At least I knew it 50 years ago. It's much better than it was. It still needs a lot more work. We've got a new US attorney. We've got a new district attorney general and a new director of Chief of Police and they've done an excellent job and getting on this early and showing that the city and the federal government with its location here in West Virginia really want to bring about justice and the federal government wants to help and will help. I know that you just, but it's it's unnerving and it's just terribly sad. Certainly, and just picking up on what you mentioned there, you used to be an advisor, a legal advisor for the department. I'm curious, if you were still advising the department, what would you suggest? Do you think the other officers who were on that scene should also be let go and possibly charged? What do you think? I'm not sure if they should be let go or not, but I know they should be have an administrative hearing and possibly be reprimanded in some manner. There were at least four other officers on the scene that stood around and did nothing. The duty to render aid is a major part of a police officers job to protect and serve and those officers did not do that. There were probably other officers involved. There was an officer back at the scene who was I think a 6th member of the Scorpion unit who didn't go to the scene. He was the person who drove up in the first video that had his body camera or his camcorder working. And he said, I hope they stop him. I'm afraid what he said was indicative of the attitude of the Scorpion unit and maybe police in general, but more likely the Scorpion unit specifically to take their aggressions out and take the law in their own hands. And this is all the more wrong with the Scorpion unit. They're not going to take their own hands and this is always wrong. So I think I don't know how they've been trained. I'm sure they've been trained well, but I don't know this group particularly learned their lesson and they acted on on basically blue testosterone and ego. But it started with that when they grabbed him out of the car, it wasn't. Excuse me, excuse me, but let me show show us your your driver's license and why did you run that light or why did you run out of the lane and whatever could have been? We saw them all giving would probably work George Santos type descriptions of what occurred earlier when they were saying he we've done it out of traffic. He was in the wrong lane. He reached for my gun. These were alibis that they were posting, knowing they were videoing and they were laying out their defense and I couldn't trust any one of them because they didn't take their oath of office to their heart and they just beat him to hell and there were three of them. Two of them, one kicked him, one punched him and one hitting with the stick baton and the other two help. All five rotten apples and I commend the police chief for doing what she did, but she and Mary Strickland, both of them want to do right or have the toughest job coming forward. They need to clean the Department of Bad Apples. They need to get intensive training. They need to make sure deescalation comes first. I've had a bill for about eight years in the Congress. It was part of George Floyd saying that we need to have training of officers in other ethnic groups to understand ethnic differences and to look at deescalating tense situations. The Memphis Police Department trains, but they need to make it more of a regular part of the curricula that there is undertaken and conserved and protocol taken out by the officers to deescalate. There was no effort to deescalate. No, not at all. How do you change the culture? I mean, as you said, you were an advisor there 30 years ago. You said it's better now than it was. I can't imagine what you're thinking. I just can't imagine how how was back then. If it you were saying is better now, what what can actually be done to change policing and the culture? Well, one thing is you can get more money and the federal government has monies available starting this next spring with grants. The Memphis Police Department should apply for to hire officers in high population areas. We need to have more money to pay officers so we can get a better officer and we had some differences with the police Association over compensation over health benefits over retirement benefits and a lot of police officers left Memphis and went to higher paying jobs in Dallas and other cities that could afford to pay more we need to be able to pay more to compete with other cities to get the best and brightest. I don't know if these five guys, they certainly were hired more recently when when the benefits were the least so we may not be getting the cream of the crop. Obviously they were not the cream of the crop. That's what it is. Secondly, you just have to have more intensive training and you have to have better supervision. Your commanders have to stress this. It's missing. I don't like to see a return to the old community oriented policing where the neighborhoods know the policeman, the police people, women and men are in the in the communities making friends, helping people and getting tips. And we don't do enough of that rather than have scorpion units out to pounce on people like they. I mean they pounced on him when he got out of the car throwing down. They were so nervous you wondered if they were hopped up on something. They were out of control and not very professional at all, but we need to have officers who the neighborhood knows and who know the neighborhood and I think that's more effective manner of policing.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1924\n","\n","Link  134 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/hLZkmoGlFgw\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/hLZkmoGlFgw\n","[youtube] hLZkmoGlFgw: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] hLZkmoGlFgw: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 2.55MiB in 00:40\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Former Vice President Mike Pence just addressed the classified documents that were found in his home. It's actually been a very humbling week for us. But I know we did the right thing. Look, the proper handling of classified information is very important to the national interest. Throughout my career in the Congress and as your Vice President, we always sought to take great care in the handling of the nation's secrets. At the close of our administration, we did a thorough review of all the documents in the possession of the office of the Vice President and in the residence of the Vice President. And I'm confident that was conducted in a professional manner. But with news in recent weeks of repeated disclosure of classified documents in the personal residence of President Biden and documents dating back to his service as Vice President, I simply thought out of an abundance of caution, it would be appropriate to review my personal records, kept at our residence in the state of Indiana. And we initiated that process. Along the way, we determined that there was a small number of documents, marked classified or sensitive, interspersed in my personal papers. Upon making that discovery, we secured those documents immediately. We alerted the National Archives. We turned them over to the FBI and soon thereafter communicated to the Congress. And while I was not aware that those classified documents were in our personal residence, let me be clear. Those classified documents should not have been in my personal residence. Mistakes were made. And I take full responsibility. And I've directed my counsel to work with the National Archives, with the Department of Justice, and with the Congress to fully cooperate in any investigation. Our national security depends on the proper handling of classified and sensitive materials. And I know that when errors are made, it's important that they be resolved swiftly and disclosed. And my only hope is that as the American people look at our conduct in this matter, that they see that we acted above politics and put the national interest first. And I pledge to each and every one of you and to the American people that we will continue to do so. So help me God.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 377\n","\n","Link  135 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/sQ3lsMMayzs\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/sQ3lsMMayzs\n","[youtube] sQ3lsMMayzs: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] sQ3lsMMayzs: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 4.70MiB in 01:22\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Joining us now, CNN military analyst, retired Major General James Spider-Marx and CNN senior political commentator, former Republican Congressman Adam Kinzinger. He's a lieutenant colonel in the US Air National Guard. Spider, first to you, what do you make of the timeline we're learning now on when these German Leopard tanks will start arriving in Ukraine and the fact that the US will send a more lethal upgraded version of the Abrams battle tanks? Well, in my mind, it's all good news. But clearly there's a logistical tail associated with the deployment and then the training necessary to get the Ukrainian forces up to speed and confident with these main battle tanks. Also bear in mind you've got challengers from the UK. So you have a mix of capabilities. You certainly have to address the training, the logistics, the maintenance, sustainment. But all those are considerations. Those aren't impediments or barriers that would lead you to a decision, a no-go decision. So I frankly am very glad the United States has stepped forward, Germany has stepped forward, and all of those considerations will be addressed. But there will be a time lag between this decision and when the realization of all those capabilities can be maximized on the battlefield. You're right, Adam. Ukraine is already pushing, we understand, for even more weapons, very much on their wish list, include fighter jets. Do you see that as the next step for Western allies potentially? Yeah, I think what we need to understand here is pretty much everything Ukraine has pushed for. It's taken a while for the US and the allies to finally agree that they in fact need that stuff. And part of that is the United States doesn't want to step out too far ahead of Europe. It's keeping this alliance together. But I think here's one of the biggest untold things that's going on in this war, which is one of the struggles in Eastern Europe over the past decade or two has been they have old Russian equipment. How do they move over to NATO standard equipment? It's obviously very different supply lines, very different training. And actually what this war has done is flushed a lot of that Russian equipment in Eastern Europe into Ukraine. They've started bringing a lot of these Eastern European countries back into total NATO standard. And in Ukraine, I think we have to look and recognize Ukraine will be a NATO standard military equipment country. And that includes F-16s. They have an excess capability right now of pilots. I have talked to these pilots. I in fact led the last effort in Congress to begin training them that can come here and learn the F-16. It'll take a couple of months because it's a very different mission set and of course weapon system. That way they're ready if and probably inevitably win. The US and the West decided to send F-16s that way. Yeah, the Ukrainians have made it abundantly clear they want the US to start supplying F-16 fighter jets, a very important development potentially indeed. Spider, the fight is still incredibly intense in the Eastern part of Ukraine, but are US officials right to advise Ukraine to cut its losses there and prepare for renewed offensives? Well, the renewed offensive is going to come. And I would tell you that it will arrive in the Donbass area or just north in the vicinity of Kharkiv, but will also be to bolster the presence that exists within the land bridge and in the vicinity of Crimea. Clearly an opportunity exists for the Ukrainians to try to separate those forces along the land bridge in the direction of Crimea. Once you do that, you could then hold the shoulder of one of those and reduce the other. You can't do it all at once. That is the long-term objective. But taking that peninsula of Crimea is going to be very difficult. We're told, Adam, that President Biden is considering a trip to Europe, possibly Poland, to mark the anniversary in February of Putin's invasion. It'll be one year next month. If he takes that step, the president, what sort of message would it send if he went, actually went inside Ukraine itself? Well, I think if he went, it would send a very powerful message. I think we can't necessarily be critical if he doesn't. Being the president of the United States is even a very different security threat than any other really head of state. That's a big deal. That's a big footprint. If he actually did pull that off, though, I'll tell you, I think it would be massive. I think it would send chills in the Russian leadership. I think it would embolden the Ukrainian people, because, look, Ukraine has shown the will to fight. That's the one thing we have seen, is they have absolutely showed that they are willing to fight to defend freedom. You have somebody that's leading the country, that leads freedom, even in times that we struggle sometimes here. I think that sends an extremely strong message that we are in this. And the psychological impact of just going there and saying, we're going to be with you forever, is what can give Ukraine the fighting spirit to go through what is going to be a pretty tough, pretty tough few months. Former Congressman Adam Kinzinger, thank you very much, retired Major General Spider Marks, thanks to you as well.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 917\n","\n","Link  136 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/NbIlInNvWEk\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/NbIlInNvWEk\n","[youtube] NbIlInNvWEk: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] NbIlInNvWEk: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 6.32MiB in 02:21\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Ukraine's president is urging the West to provide more weapons after the latest round of Russian attacks. Ukraine's military says it shot down 47 of 70 missiles launched at Ukraine, along with 18 Iranian-made drones. At least 11 people were killed. Missiles that did make it through targeted energy facilities and hit some residential areas. Substantial damage to the power grid is reported. In the meantime, fighting is intensifying in several cities in the Donetsk region, including Bakhmut. Fred Pleiken has more on that for us. Ukraine's tanks taking aim at the invading Russians. Kiev's forces rallying to try to halt the massive assault on Bakhmut. The city, where there are still some 6,000 civilians, has become a cauldron of fire. From this vantage point, you can both see and hear just how fierce the fighting is. You can hear impacts from heavy weapons not just every minute, but literally every second. The Ukrainians say that the Russians are pouring a massive amount of personnel and weapons into this area because they seem to want to take Bakhmut at nearly any cost. There are plenty of regular Russian troops fighting around Bakhmut now, but the Ukrainians say it's still the Wagner private military company that's leading the charge, with waves of fighters trying to storm Ukrainian positions both north and south of the city, as well as specialized forces like these snipers claiming to have killed a Ukrainian soldier. All I could see was a curtained window, the sniper says. The person who was paired with me saw a thermal outline and I just determined where to shoot. Wagner's boss Yevgeny Prigozhin often touts his militia successes, but the cost is immense. This is a Wagner cemetery in the Krasnodar region of southern Russia. Row after row of fresh graves, a disposable force used to take just a few kilometers of land. Wagner acknowledges recruiting prisoners straight out of jail and throwing them on the battlefield with minimal training and only slim chances of survival. That same indifference shown in Russian strikes that kill and maim Ukrainian civilians every day. These folks are cleaning up after a Russian missile landed in their neighborhood near Bakhmut. We were getting heating from the heating plant which was hit, Yuri tells me. Yesterday at three o'clock it was destroyed, so now we have no electricity, no heating, we have nothing. And a few miles away, one person was killed in another densely populated area. Some of the long distance drones and missiles that Russia uses to attack Ukraine come down right near civilian areas. This year is only a few yards away from a kindergarten. However, others are used to directly target critical infrastructure. Oh, you're so lucky. More than 50 missiles fired just on Thursday. And while many of them were intercepted by Ukrainian air defenses, some were not brought down, adding to the daily toll of destruction. The missile terror, more motivation for Ukraine soldiers around Bakhmut to stand their ground and bring Vladimir Putin's invasion to a standstill. Fred Pleitgen, CNN, near Bakhmut, Ukraine. Sam Kiley is back with us this hour from Kyiv. We just heard Fred's report, the incestant bombardment specifically in Bakhmut. And of course, there's been advice to the Ukrainians focus elsewhere. Could you give me an idea of what is happening on the front lines here, Sam? Well, you've got an 800 mile front line at least stretching from the north of the country in a great kind of U shape all the way around to the south. Now, the fighting has been concentrated in the east around Bakhmut, but also towns to the north and south of there. In that area, the salient that pushes furthest into territory that has already been grabbed by Russia. But there has been an increase in operations by both sides, but notably by Russia, low level operations on the front in the south, in Zaporizhzhia, and continuous, almost continuous bombardment of the relatively recently liberated city of Kherson across the Dnieper River, where the Russians are on the other side of the river now pounding the civilian city. The anticipation is, though, that there could be an offensive from the Russians in the spring, if not sooner than that. The Ukrainians are saying they need more weapons, more capability to protect their skies because they want to assault their own conduct, their own assaults, regain the momentum that was so effective in liberating Kherson and before that, a large area around Kharkiv, not that far from where Fred was reporting there, Eleni. And now they're also pointing out that this latest wave of missile attacks included at least two Khinzal missiles. These are hypersonic, that sort of ultra supersonic, if you like, missiles launched from aircraft that evade all of the capabilities that the Ukrainians have in terms of surface-to-air defences and reinforces from the Ukrainian perspective, according to the Ukrainian Air Force spokesman, the need that they have for Patriot and other sophisticated air defences because these very state-of-the-art new missiles developed by Russia that the United States is also trying to develop, we understand, are almost impossible to stop because they fly so fast and they're highly maneuverable. They're also capable of delivering a warhead of some 500 kilograms, about 1,100 pounds of high explosives or ultimately a nuclear warhead. So you've got this very strange situation in which you've got very highly sophisticated, 21st century type weapons being used by Russia from time to time. And then as Fred was reporting there, these human wave attacks being conducted by conscripts and by semi conscripted prisoners under the Wagner Group with reportedly, and we don't have independent verification of this, punishment battalions to the rear, forcing young Russian soldiers to attack in human waves, these Ukrainian defences. It's becoming a very ugly and very bloody war at ground level and increasingly dangerous in its sophistication in the air, Eleni. Yeah, it's intensifying and of course we're seeing damage to critical infrastructure as well. Sam, Kylie, thank you so much.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1013\n","\n","Link  137 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/W8palAi_ies\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/W8palAi_ies\n","[youtube] W8palAi_ies: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] W8palAi_ies: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 8.92MiB in 02:13\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  This is how people celebrate the Lunar New Year in Dalai Village. Cheers! This year's celebration is particularly special. The adults around this table all work in factories in the cities. This is the only time when many of them can see their children. We go wherever we can earn money. China's zero-COVID policy over the last three years has made it all even harder. We couldn't go back home because we wanted to. Now you're free to go. No, I'm happy too. The people here are warm and inviting. The people here are so friendly. I literally just walking by and they're like, come join us for lunch. We came to this place in China's southern Guizhou province to see how a part of rural China is celebrating the Lunar New Year without pandemic restrictions. This village is nestled deep within the mountains. It's remote, hard to access. Because of that, for hundreds of years since the villagers have settled here, the majority of the food they eat, they either grow or they raise themselves. We visited villagers' home. Hello! We can eat two of these. Sanjia greets us with a treat and alcohol, both made from rice from the paddy fields nearby. Cheers! Drinking is a big part of celebrating here. We're going to go. And Sanjia is popular in this village, her door is rarely closed. Relatives stream in to use this machine. They pour in their freshly baked sticky rice. It turns into paste. Her machine is a novelty here. Before, they had to pound the rice by hand with sticks for hours. About a thousand people live in this village, and for hundreds of years, they've lived in these traditional wooden houses. And you can hear the chickens crowing. And there are these ducks as well that they raise for food. In many ways, this place is like a time capsule. Its physical isolation has preserved their way of life for centuries. They're China's dull ethnic minority. They have their own language, tradition and culture. But they can't escape the economic realities of modernity. Normally, this village is full of the elderly and young kids, with most of the working-age adults gone, working in faraway factories, sending money home. It's only for these few days, during the Lunar New Year holiday, when they can really all be together. We came across this migrant worker who's just returned from Jiangxi province, more than 600 miles away. She told me he's brought some oranges and candies for his son and traveled for more than a day to get home by bus. This couple works in a factory 500 miles away in Guangdong province, making circuit boards. So you haven't seen your child for a year? Yes. How did you feel when you saw him? I was very happy. He didn't even walk when I left. Really? Yes. He was very young. Wow. I was very happy when I saw him walk when I came back. Yes. When the parents are away, their grandparents take care of the kids. This is common in rural China. When I arrived here that night, my daughter was lying here and waiting for my dad to come back. When I arrived home, I hugged her and she fell asleep. For the first time in three years, millions of Chinese migrant families are finally able to reunite without the fear of COVID lockdowns. I try to find out if this village's remoteness has shielded it in any way from the country's sweeping wave of COVID cases and deaths. Almost everyone I speak to on camera says no one around them has gotten COVID, like this elderly woman who makes traditional crafts. You never wore masks? No, we never wore masks. We never wore masks. We were not wearing masks when we were pregnant. How many vaccines did you take? We took one. We took one vaccine. But we run into another group of young people who say otherwise. The man in the brown jacket with his back turned is a doctor at a hospital in a nearby city. The residents here don't dare to come. They have symptoms. They're better now. But they don't know it's陽性. They think it's a cold. It's probably a cold. Because you guys will measure it yourself. What's the result? There's no confirmation. The symptoms should be confirmed. But it's just a check. So we've got the three government minders following us. A group of six government minders greeted us the moment we arrived in the village. It's common for local officials to keep a close eye on foreign journalists in their jurisdictions. But they were especially persistent in this village, following our every move. So we just wrapped up the interview and one of the government minders is sitting out over there. At least four of them booked rooms in our same hotel or nearby. So we drive out of the village to visit a public hospital in a neighboring county about two hours away, hoping these government minders won't follow us so people will feel more comfortable speaking freely. We walk inside the fever clinic. It's almost entirely empty. In the main hospital area, there are more people, but it's not packed. It's a stark contrast to the images of overflowing hospitals in major cities across China from weeks before. I asked a nurse on another floor of the hospital if it was packed with patients a few weeks ago. She says it's always packed and busy here. We try to ask why. It looks empty here, but another doctor interrupts, ending our interview. We find one woman, a patient's family member, who is willing to speak to us. Soon after, we realize we're being followed apparently by a whole different crew. They're following us all the way here. It's very obvious. There's at least two, three government-minders. They're still following us all the way here. They follow us to hospital after hospital, preventing anyone from speaking to us. I try confronting them. And what happens next during my interview with this girl shocks us. The man pushes the girl and her family away, then later leaves them alone. But her interviews in the marketplace are over. China CDC says the COVID peak across the country has passed. And in rural areas like this, experts say there's likely far more silent suffering. People who died at home because they couldn't afford to go to the hospital or were unable to get there on time. Back in the village, we're greeted by the sounds of squealing pigs getting ready to be slaughtered. It's a lunar New Year tradition. Some of the families raise the pigs themselves. Others buy them from sellers like this woman, who tells me that now that people can gather and barbecue together, her business is booming. Decades ago, for most countryside families, this was the only time of the year when they could afford to eat meat. Now it's about bringing the family together to feast. So this is a whole family of relatives are all getting together for the lunar New Year, enjoying the freshly killed pig meat. Sandhya teaches me how they dress and do their hair for special occasions, showing me all the clothes and fabric in her home that she's made herself. Sewing just a thin strip of this cloth takes her more than a day. But the mothers here tell me they don't expect their kids to carry on all of the traditions. One of Sandhya's relatives, a young woman who works at a cosmetics factory 600 miles away in Guangdong, invites us to her home that night. Her parents and grandparents are proud. She sends most of her earnings back to them. Whether it's in the village or in faraway factories, they're hardworking people. They'll do whatever it takes to give their kids a better life, even if it means long bouts of separation from them, making reunions like these all the more meaningful.

She told Politico in a statement, quote, when I was young, some people deliberately misspelled or mispronounced my name. Asian-Americans have worked hard to change that experience for the next generation. He doesn't seem to understand that, which says a whole lot more about him than it will ever say about Asian-Americans. This response comes after high-profile shootings targeting the Asian-American community and after the former president repeatedly used a demeaning term in his social media posts to describe Chao. I won't say it, but you can see it there highlighted on the screen. He has also singled out her Asian-American heritage as Ms. McConnell's, quote, China-loving wife. As the editorial board of the Wall Street Journal noted last year, quote, her real offense was resigning as transportation secretary after Mr. Trump's disgraceful behavior on January 6. I'm joined now by CNN political commentator, Elissa Farah Griffin, who served as director of communications for the former president and has spoken out against his remarks. Also, senior White House correspondent, MJ Lee, and senior political commentator, Scott Jennings, a longtime adviser to Senator Mitch McConnell, who is, of course, husband to Elaine Chao. MJ, I do want to start with you. You covered Donald Trump for a long time. Trump's spokesperson, Steven Chung, who is Asian-American, told Politico, quote, people should stop feigning outrage and engaging in controversies that exist only in their heads. So what do you make of that as both a reporter and as an Asian-American? Yeah, John, you know, I think I would have thought that especially during a week like this one when there has been so much pain in the Asian-American community that someone like Mr. Chung might have been thinking a lot about the experience of being Asian-American, you know, there is no fake outrage here. I think there is just the reality, and that is that, yeah, Asian-Americans and Asian people across this country confront all kinds of racism all the time, and I think what is particularly disturbing to think about this week is thinking about when you see an ex-president mocking and making overtly racist comments about his former cabinet member, what message that might send to the average person about what might be okay to say to the average Asian-American and Asian person in this country, and I'm talking about, you know, your neighbor, your colleague, just somebody who looks like me walking down the street, and, you know, Trump has been stoking these racial divisions ever since he was a candidate and going way far back past that. He did it when he was president, and I think we have no reason to think that he wouldn't keep doing that if he were to get another four years in the White House. Yeah, and there's no reason to think he doesn't know exactly what he is doing. And, MJ, just to hit this one more time, when Elaine Chao speaks about her life experience with growing up, people mispronouncing her name when she was young, does that strike a chord with you? Yeah, it does, and I think it probably strikes a chord with many, many Asian-Americans in this country, and, you know, she said that Asians have been trying to change that experience for future generations and that she believes that Trump clearly doesn't understand that. I think she is clearly right that President Trump has no idea how embedded that experience is in being Asian-American, and I just want to make the point that we are not always talking about overt racism or comments that are just so heinous or even bordering on violence. We are talking about sort of the everyday experience, too, of just being made to feel like an other, that you don't belong, that if you look like me, then you must be foreign, and that you have to sort of prove your worth. It is being asked the question, do you speak English? It is being asked, well, where are you really from? You know, it is being a reporter at a Trump rally in Iowa and being told by somebody, you know, no offense to you, but there are these people coming from Asia all the time and having families here and taking away our jobs. You know, I know you know this, John, that I became an American citizen back in 2016. It was one of the happiest days of my life, but I still, even though I'm now an American citizen, grapple with, I think, that question of belonging as an Asian American that I believe is what Elaine Chao is talking about. Look, I count that as a win for the United States that we got you in 2017. Alyssa, one of the things you have heard, almost verbatim from some Republicans, is, oh, Trump just likes to call people names. This is just him doing what he does. Well, and listen, I'm not going to feign outrage and pretend I'm shocked that President Trump once again used racist comments to attack somebody. This is a pattern for him. He's done it countless times since he was first a declared candidate. I think the two things stand out to me is the timing and the target. Obviously, as MJ mentioned, this tragic mass shooting targeting the Asian American community and just the fact that violence and harassment against them have been on the rise, dating back to COVID and conspiracy theories around that, but also the target. This is a woman, Elaine Chao, who served in the Reagan administration, the Bush administration. She's been a naturalized citizen since she was 19 years old. She's been in public service. She is an American who served in his administration. Her only offense, of course, was that she opposed the insurrection. But the question, again, for Republicans is, do we want four more years of this? Do we want four more years of explaining to our kids why the president or the former president is saying racist, offensive things that we would yell at them for saying on the playground? Like, it's just the turning a blind eye in the Rick Scott. He likes to call names. I'm just calling him out there. Like, no, this is blatantly racist. It's the worst timing, and it's such a reminder if we don't need to do this again. Scott, the do we want four more years is a political question, but there's also a moral question here is, do we want four more minutes of a public figure saying racist things, and how do you stop that from happening? And what would you advise Republican officials to say about this? And I ask because Mitch McConnell has been reticent at times to even mention Trump's name, and he's doing that on purpose. I think he doesn't want to necessarily elevate him. But in a case like this, do you think it makes sense to speak out? I think it made sense for Elaine Chao to speak out because she's classier than Donald Trump will ever think about being, and she's let this go for some time. But at some point, it becomes not just an issue for her personally, but an issue for the entire Asian American community. I mean, Elaine Chao, her parents, her family, they are a thousand times the American patriots Donald Trump will ever be. And for him to question their patriotism and question their love of this country and say, you know, they have something to do with communist China, it's outrageous. So I'm glad that she stood up for the entirety of Asian American community. As for the rest of the Republican party, I think if you hear Donald Trump say something blatantly racist, the way he's doing against Elaine Chao, and you cannot summon the courage to deal with it, if asked, then you need to look inside of yourself and say, what am I doing here? What kind of a party are we building here? And what do we want our country to be? And are we moral enough to lead this country candidly? I mean, the Chaos are an American success story. Elaine Chao is the first Asian American woman to be in a cabinet, the longest serving cabinet member since World War II. This person is an inspiration to an entire group of people. Regardless of your politics, Asian Americans look up to Elaine Chao. And we have this egomaniac, this infant, this racist boob who continues to make these statements about her, it's outrageous. And we all ought to say it every single day, even if Senator McConnell and Elaine Chao choose not to wrestle with a pig in the mud. And that's where the Republican party ought to stand.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1487\n","\n","Link  139 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/uSZ6Rj9urhw\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/uSZ6Rj9urhw\n","[youtube] uSZ6Rj9urhw: Downloading webpage\n","[youtube] uSZ6Rj9urhw: Refetching age-gated info webpage\n"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["WARNING: unable to download video info webpage: HTTP Error 410: Gone\n","ERROR: Sign in to confirm your age\n","This video may be inappropriate for some users.\n"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Skipped 139\n","\n","\n","Link  140 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/XWYhJ7NNF1c\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/XWYhJ7NNF1c\n","[youtube] XWYhJ7NNF1c: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] XWYhJ7NNF1c: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 5.79MiB in 02:06\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Russia's propaganda machine is moving into high gear as the war in Ukraine nears its first anniversary. Vladimir Putin's shameless supporters in state media are making a mockery of Western weapons, but not everyone's buying it, CNN's Nick Robertson reports. Toothless cats battered Abrams, he says. The Russian state media anchor points to a huge graphic alleging flaws in the NATO tanks. His purposeful propaganda, playing down risks the Russian troops in Ukraine, does seem to be working. Sending tanks is going to be bad for the Americans and Germans, she says. We're going to win regardless, Sergey tells us. It's just enlarging the conflict. If we pull out, the West will put more pressure on us. But not everyone buys the state TV hype. Putin has killed off independent media, but not independence of mind. This young film student tells our team a friend was drafted and deployed, but has now disappeared. I'm for peace, she says. It's very sad. People are dying. I'm on the verge of tears here. I don't know if it's true or not or what's going on in this war, this lady tells us. But I do know people who've been killed. Some of them are friends. All emotions the Kremlin likes to prey on. Around the capital, air defense systems have been lofted atop government buildings. The less than subtle message, Russia's under threat. It's leverage Putin needs to drum up more recruits for the increasingly unpopular meat grinder that is Ukraine's front-line trenches. In more primetime Putin propaganda, Evgeny Popov pops a pun for the audience, tells them the German Leopard 2 tanks will burn very nicely. Another Putin acolyte, the insanely popular Vladimir Solovyev, asks the audience, after all this, isn't Berlin a lawful target? Such is the stitch up in Russian media. Putin is able to spin almost any message he wants. His TV puppets serve farce and fear in equal measure. But even that's not going down so well with some. Everyone is listening to Solovyev's opinion, this lady says, but it would be good if the experts started expressing their real opinions, instead of obeying orders from Putin. What's real is anyone's guess, and for some that means tuning out. This lady tells us she doesn't know about the tanks when we ask her opinion. I think that this is a political war and not a war for the people, this lady tells the team. What are we supposed to do, she says. Our opinions mean diddly squat. We isolated from outside views and under threat of harsh retribution if they dissent, Russians are stuck in a rut in a war they don't want with a leader they can't remove, and the threat of potential recruitment around the corner. They're doing what Russians have historically done in the face of adversity, focusing on their own survival. Nick Robinson, CNN, London. We told you that Western allies have promised to send tanks to Ukraine, but some countries are moving cautiously with committing specific numbers. Salma El-Ziz joins us from London with more. So Salma, President Zelensky got the tanks he wanted, but he's already asking for more. So take us through what's on Kiev's wish list, and is the West willing to fulfill it? Absolutely. It's really a race against time now to get those tanks to the front lines as quickly as possible. There are two logistical issues here. These tanks are spread across over a dozen countries. Germany has to give preauthorization. They are the manufacturers of these Leopard 2 tanks. They have to give preauthorization for every country to deploy those tanks. They have to provide training. That's supposed to start as soon as possible for Ukrainian soldiers in Germany. And then there's the question of compensation. How will NATO or how will Germany pay for these tanks or compensate to countries that give these tanks to Ukraine? All of those logistics again being dealt with in Berlin. Take a listen to how Ukraine's defense minister responded when one reporter asked how quickly are we going to see these tanks on the battlefield? Minister, can you get the tanks to Ukraine in time? Of course we will. How long will it take to get them? I think at the end of the first quarter of the year. That's what we are going to do. How many months? Two, three, four? I just said at the end of March, I think. Now, the reason for this rush, the reason for this push is this counteroffensive. As the weather gets warmer, there is an expectation that Russian forces will pick up the tempo of the war, try to attack Ukrainian forces. Ukraine, of course, for its part wants to push through. It's described these tanks as an iron fist that will allow them to spearhead their offensive in the spring. But a note of caution here, Kim. In total, we have just over 100 tanks that have been promised. Among them are those 30 Abrams, 31 Abrams to be exact, tanks from the United States. Those could take over a year before they actually arrive in Ukraine. As you heard there, the Leopard tanks arriving sooner. But this is a lot less than what President Zelensky says he needs. He was asking for over 300 tanks. And as I said, just over 100 going into Ukraine. But really what this is about is the bigger picture here, Kim. This is about the political will of allies to provide tanks. Something that was unimaginable a year ago. So for Kyiv, they're hoping this opens the door a little bit to ask for more of those weapons on their wishlist. Kim. All right. Thanks so much, Salma. I hope you enjoyed our probe histories in London.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 966\n","\n","Link  141 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/Wg5iwMNoPwg\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wg5iwMNoPwg\n","[youtube] Wg5iwMNoPwg: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] Wg5iwMNoPwg: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 3.36MiB in 00:46\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  I understand you were granted exclusive access to the largest ever joint military exercise between the United States and Israel. Tell us about that. Yeah, this joint week-long exercise, dubbed Juniper Oak, is unprecedented in its scale and size, and among its target audiences for the messaging is Iran. CNN granted exclusive access to the danger zone on the supercarrier USS George H.W. Bush to see part of the largest ever American and Israeli joint military exercise covering all aspects of warfare, from the air, on land, to the sea, online, and even in space. The timing is no accident, meant to send a clear signal to Iran and other adversaries in the region, that despite the attention on Ukraine and U.S. concerns over the new right-wing Israeli government, the Americans remain deeply aligned and committed to a military partnership with Israel. For the Americans and the Israelis, these types of exercises are a show of force, a show of partnership, and a way for the both of them to show the world that they can walk and chew gum at the same time. Only through a firm commitment to this partnership are we able to plan and organize such an incredibly complex high-end operation with so many elements across such a large geographic area against all aspects of warfighting, some of which are seen, some of which are not. For the Israelis, the exercise is crucial. They've long opposed a return to the Iranian nuclear deal and have argued that a credible military threat needs to be on the table to deter Iran from fully developing a nuclear weapon. Israel and the U.S. share the same values, the IDF and the U.S. sent come see eye to eye the threats on this area. More than 6,400 American personnel joined 1,100 Israelis as part of these exercises that utilize more than 142 aircraft, including these F-18s. And while the Israelis and Americans regularly carry out joint exercises, this one shifted the focus more on the offensive rather than just defensive capabilities. It also came together in just two months incredibly quickly, especially for something of this scale compared to the typical year or so of planning. While officials shy away from drawing a direct connection between the speed and recent events in Iran and the breakdown last year of negotiations over the nuclear deal, it is hard to ignore the context. I think it's fairly clear that we can very quickly move assets in the region to respond to crisis and we can do so alongside our partners and we can fight and conduct offensive operations in every domain alongside our partners. The military option, which President Biden called the last resort to deal with Iran, seems to be on loud display. Well, more than 180,000 pounds of live munitions were used during this exercise. And one thing that officials I spoke to today pointed out to me that was especially for them exciting and interesting about this exercise was really how it covered absolutely all aspects of modern warfare from the typical planes and boats and on the ground, but also including cyber warfare and this time they said space. Very important. Excellent reporting, Hadass. Thank you very much. And a very significant signal message to the Iranians right now. That was the intent. Thank you very, very much.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 560\n","\n","Link  142 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/DZCdacPT0OQ\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/DZCdacPT0OQ\n","[youtube] DZCdacPT0OQ: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] DZCdacPT0OQ: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 5.85MiB in 00:00\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  And good evening, I'm Erin Burnett. Out front tonight, Ukraine sounding the alarm. Air sirens blaring across much of central and eastern Ukraine today as Putin's forces ramp up. And tonight, Ukrainian troops have now completely withdrawn from solid are Putin's forces are making gains in the east. But any small gains are coming at great cost. I mean, just take solid are no one knows the number of dead there. It's really unknowable at this point, except that it is unbearably high for the prize of a small, not strategically located town. So tonight, Russia control solid are. So just take a look at this. What does that even mean to control solid are that town? Well, here's new video. You can see it is a total wasteland, total total destruction, and it's only five square miles. All that death for that. And tonight, the battle is raging on in nearby Bakhmut or two Ukrainian fighters there. Tell CNN the situation in the city is incredibly alarming. Here's some new audio that we're going to play for you. This is a Ukrainian soldier who is on the front line there in Bakhmut. Listen to him. The city of Bakhmut is constantly under artillery and airstrikes. The Russians are now massing infantry using armored vehicles and tanks and making minor advances. They are climbing like cockroaches. Our units are holding their ground and holding the line of defense. The word cockroaches, of course, multi layered there. But the image is of swarms of Russian soldiers, and it does add to Putin pushing the image of a massive escalation. Just take a look at this image from today. This is a Russian warship armed with hypersonic missiles training with Russian allies, China and South Africa, right? They want everyone to see these images. But of course, that is a powerful system. And Ukraine's defense minister tonight is proclaiming that the Ukrainians now have more to fight back the iron fist to break Russian lines. And that is because the Ukrainians, of course, now formally have U. S. And German tanks, both countries agreeing to send their top of the line tanks to Ukraine. The U. S. Is providing Zelensky with 31 highly maneuverable M one Abrams tanks. Today's announcement builds on the hard work and commitment from countries around the world. That's what this is about. Helping Ukraine defend and protect Ukrainian land. These tanks are a significant development for Ukraine. And while Russian state TV tried to downplay the tanks, one Russian war reporter who has been there on the front lines warned Putin not to dismiss the help. And this reporter saying it's significant again because it's in the context of Russian state television. The reporter said, Even without air support, such vehicles are a very serious threat and could cause our advancing troops a lot of trouble. If we're talking about hundreds of armored vehicles, the effect could be the same as the appearance of high Mars units at the front, which, of course, transformed this war months ago. Fred Plakin is out front and Kramatorsk that is near where the battles are raging in and around Bakhmut. And Fred, I know that you've been talking to so many of these Ukrainian soldiers on the ground and back moot. What are they telling you about the importance of the tanks? Hi there, Aaron. You know, we spoke with soldiers fighting on the front line in and around a bakhmut, and they were absolutely elated to hear that Western main battle tanks could be coming to Ukraine in the not too distant future. They say tanks have been absolutely essential to help them hold back moot for this long. Of course, they understand it's going to be a while before tanks actually get here. But they say right now they need all the help they can get because the Russians are making a huge push to take back moot. Here's what we're learning. The Russian army claims its overwhelming firepower is decimating Ukrainian defenses on the most brutal front in this war around the town bakhmut. 15 men just ran into this house. Yes, target hit. He managed to collapse the middle of the building. Ukraine has now acknowledged losing its last foothold in the small town, Solidar, north of Bakhmut. The Russians there mostly mercenaries from the Wagner private military company judging by their own claims. We were fast to select the target, charge up and hit it. We hit it precisely. We hit the building right in the place where the A T G M was located. But despite sources telling CNN the U. S. Has advised Ukraine to withdraw from bakhmut. Even Wagner commanders admit Kiev's forces are fighting back. The enemy puts up fierce resistance to our fighters. The enemy is holding on and is getting additional reserves and military supplies. And the Ukrainians continue probing in other areas far from bakhmut. The military releasing this video of a daring raid across the Dnipro River in south Ukraine, taking out a Russian command facility there. But to go on the offensive, Ukraine needs hundreds of main battle tanks. So far, Western partners have pledged about 100. Moscow has vowed to hit those tanks when they enter Ukraine and is conducting a show of force of its own, sending the frigate Admiral Gorshkov, which Moscow says carries hypersonic missiles to ocean drills with the Chinese and South African navies. But for now, a bakhmut is the epicenter of this conflict and Ukrainian soldiers here say they will fight for every inch. One day their artillery works and the next day the infantry assaults. It's a difficult time now, but our boys keep standing their ground. So as you can see there, Aaron, pretty tough for the Ukrainian soldiers on the front line right now. What we're also hearing from senior military commanders is that the Russians are bringing more and more personnel, but also a lot of heavy equipment to this front line. It seems as though they really wants to take bakhmut and also some of the surrounding areas as well. In fact, the Ukrainians are saying there's almost constant shellings and also a lot of attempts by the Russians to try and breach the front lines. Aaron. All right. Thank you very much.

You're lying to the American people When you stop lying to yourself When you stop lying to yourself So you actually were on a volleyball team? Is that right in college and Baruch College? Is that true? Is that true? This is Santos ex-boyfriend is speaking to Outfront for his first television interview in an Outfront exclusive Pedro Villarva shared this photo with us of him celebrating Christmas with Santos and other loved ones in 2014 He told me that Santos went by the name Anthony Devolder when they dated They lived together for about a year and Villarva says he repeatedly turned down Santos's proposals to get engaged Pedro joins me now from Brazil and Pedro I very much appreciate your time and I know that you're deciding to speak out was a very careful decision Does this George Santos the one that we are now all seeing sound like the man that you dated and lived with? No, not at all I'm a completely different person How so? It's just oh at the beginning of the relationship he was fine. He was so sweet caring He actually like he showed like yeah that he actually cared and all But later on like when I started finding out the lies, I thought that was it that it was my phone That when state that he stole That he ponded that I believe The jewelry as well from from our friend that used to live with us And so like the tickets to Hawaii that he had Purchased for us to go where he was planning to be proposing for the third time as well But the engagement never happened nothing like that, you know, I know you say Santos Repeatedly asked you to get engaged Before you broke up and he appears Pedro to reference you in an Instagram post that you shared with us from 2015 He writes this is my family that I managed to screw up. I will not give up. I will fight till the end I love you PV. I miss you Now Pedro, you were 18 and Santos was 26 when you met him. When did you know? That you couldn't trust him Towards the end of the relationship It was more like he started like I started finding out about the lies in December and then it went on until February And then that's when I broke up with him and then I went on my way But then later on like we still had contact with each other because he did it like I found out about the lies But we still kept in contact with each other just saying like oh, how are you? How's your mom and stuff because when I found out that she was sick I still cared for her and then I went to visit her a couple of times later on But then when I found out about the other stuff, I was like what a psycho You know, I want to share a picture of you that you shared with us of you and his mother you say you were close and Besides, you know, he said she was a survivor of the 9-eleven terror attacks, right? She was he also claimed she was an executive at Citigroup. She was a part of many of his lies there There you are with her This is a picture you shared with us Did did she ever discuss these these lies with you? Did she know any of this? Oh I never Know 9-eleven no Citigroup nothing like that from when I was with them I never saw her going to work at Citigroup or anything and they never mentioned anything about 9-eleven even because I was born on 9-eleven and If I say like if they knew that I was born on 9-eleven, I think they were gonna reference that and say something about it But never heard anything about it. I Want to play George Santos what we've all now heard Pedro explaining who he is in his own words over the years My grandparents survived the Holocaust I mean Latino Jew my mom was a 9-eleven survivor they sent me to a good prep school. So and which was Horaceman hot prep in the Bronx I actually went to school on a volleyball scholarship when I was in Baruch We were the number one volleyball but I put myself through college and got an MBA from NYU I also founded my own nonprofit organization Prior to running I decided to close it. It was an animal rescue. We had a great organization We were able to save animals dogs cats Horses if I've lived an honest life, I've never been accused shoot of of anything bad doing I Do want to note of course he was charged with embezzlement So he has obviously been accused of bad doing but you know Pedro the point is some of these lies were so minor and yet So specific, I mean the volleyball one right not just saying that he played volleyball But he had a scholarship that he slayed teams from Harvard and Yale that he was the smallest player on the team that he needed To get to knee replacements. I mean, you know, he went deep with the lies Why does he do this? I? Don't know. I think he's just out of his mind and one lie led to the other and now that's everybody found out Like they're finding out like the little stuff as well. I just think that he should not be in Congress and Oh my god, it was so many things that I found out afterwards as well things that I did not know because I still believe That he actually went to a brew college like like he used to say I already knew about the the city group that he said that he used to work in like the Investments and so I already knew that those were lies because I never saw him working actually but then the other stuff like the stuff about the paths the He actually did used to say about the organization about FOPO as well that he used to do like He there was another person they also had a pet organization So they used to have like a little picky fights with each other as well. So But then I never saw anything going towards a like Charity stuff when we were together. He never used to do anything. So towards that so it was so So is so Pedro, you know, what do you say? Are you surprised? He's now a member of Congress. I mean does that That was that was that an ambition that he had He always what he always looked for was fame and power That's all the all he cared about and he got it He got the thing of the lies and he got the power that he's in Congress now, but it's He shouldn't be there. Well, the story has gotten so big right everyone. Everyone is paying attention to it You know, he's being spoofed by late-night shows and other comedians He here's a clip from this weekend Saturday Night Live, I don't know if you saw it, but I'll play it for you Peter You lied about your mom dying in 9-eleven, I think I said 7-eleven No, you even lied about being Jewish.

Mr. Valder if you're nasty I graduated on a volleyball scholarship from baruch atah adonai university I See you laughing people are laughing but obviously, you know, these this is serious stuff I mean, do you think that he'll ever resign? I don't think so. His ego is too. It's too big. It's too high. He's not gonna resign If they don't find out something to get him off, he's not gonna do it. That's for sure All right.

The other four were released on bond. Desmond Mills Jr. is one of those four officers hosting his $250,000 bond last night, and he is back home now with his family. So speaking of that officer, I'm joined now by the attorney for Desmond Mills Jr., Blake Ballin. Blake, thank you so much for joining us. I really appreciate it. The police chief in an interview just a short while ago said that there is no evidence to substantiate the claim of reckless driving. They haven't found any evidence in video or otherwise. Right. What's your reaction to that? That proof's in the pudding. I need to see it. I haven't seen anything. I haven't seen the video that we're all waiting to see. Haven't seen anything about the stop from a defense standpoint. This is the beginning stages of things, and we are looking forward to seeing what evidence they have. He, the officers had a duty of care. It was said by the police chief that they did not follow the Memphis Police Department guidelines for duty of care. They did not render care. Obviously there is also the kidnapping charge as well. How do you respond to that? Well, specifically focused on that kidnapping charge, and of course, having not seen this video, it's difficult for me to talk about the facts. But to say that an officer who crosses a line or does something illegal in detaining somebody who has committed an aggravated kidnapping is a dangerous precedent to set. Why do you say that? Well, every time a Fourth Amendment violation occurs, every time somebody claims they have been wrongfully arrested by a police officer, whether an egregious violation or a slight one, are officers now looking at being charged with an A felony and looking at up to 25 years in jail, it's going to make it difficult for officers to do their jobs. There is the attempted murder charge, or the murder charge, I should say, second degree murder charge. You believe that that is an overcharge and difficult to prove. Why? So that requires that they prove that Mr. Mills acted with a reasonable degree of certainty with regard to his actions, that his actions were certain to cause death. And that's just simply not the case. When this video comes out, I expect that Mr. Mills will not be delivering blows that cause death. Why do you believe that? Because I've sat down with Mr. Mills. I've looked him in the eye. I know the kind of person he is. I've talked with other people who've seen the video. And I just don't believe that Mr. Mills is capable of committing that act. What did he tell you about the confrontation? I cannot tell you what my client has told me. When you give us an indication of, you're saying that you don't believe that he delivered blows. So obviously in your conversations, he told you, I did not deliver blows. He's not the only person I've talked to, Don. OK. You've talked to others? I've talked to others. And the levels of culpability amongst these five officers are different. And I expect that you're going to see in this video that my client, Desmond Mills, is not, in fact, guilty of the crimes he's been charged with. Then why wouldn't he render aid if there were other people who were culpable? Go on. Sorry. I mean, there are circumstances we don't know about yet. Whether Mr. Mills was injured, whether he, there's pepper spray flying in the air, what he was doing while others were acting in an unlawful way. Until I see that video, I can't say. Speaking to the father of Tyree Nichols, he said there's videotape. The tape shows that Tyree was propped up against a wall, handcuffed, that he slumped over. The officers lift him back up and says, you know, some expletives about to sit up or get up. If he's sitting there, why, officers couldn't just try to get him to a hospital to get aid to him, to the paramedics? I haven't seen any of this. When I do, I can comment on it. For now, I just, I cannot answer that without having seen this video. The reason that you believe that there's different levels of culpability is because of the amount of bail. Is that what you believe? That's part of it. Part of it is just my discussions with my client, with the district attorney, with the U.S. attorney. I mean, I've been in constant contact with the prosecutors here. So while I haven't seen the video, I know a little bit about what's going on here. And I expect there's going to be different levels of action here. And so I caution everyone to look at this with an open mind and to treat each of these officers as individuals. As you know, under these circumstances, when you have someone who's died and then you have the, you know, everyone involved, most people involved saying, listen, the videotape is damning. It's going to be hard to get some level of sympathy or empathy for your client. You have been saying that you've spoken to his family members about the history and who Officer Mills is as a person and was as an officer. Let me say this first, that my heart goes out to the Nichols family as a defense lawyer. This is an interesting case for me. I have dedicated my professional life to fighting against injustice in this system, to fighting against a system where there is systemic racism for centuries. And to now find myself representing somebody who's a part of that system is an interesting position to be in. But I want to remind everybody that just because Mr. Mills was a part of that system doesn't mean that he can't also be a victim of it. And so it's my job to protect him and to protect his rights. And I'm doing that not only because I believe in the system, but because I believe in Mr. Mills. I have talked to his family. I have talked to his father. I have looked him in the eye. And I have learned the kind of person Desmond Mills is. He is a good man. There are plenty of bad officers out there. There are plenty of good ones. The vast majority are good. And I believe Desmond Mills is a good person. Why do you say he's a victim of the system? I'm saying he could be a victim of the system, that just because he is a officer, a former officer, because he is part of the system that I, as a defense lawyer, spent my career fighting against doesn't mean that now that he's on the other side, that he couldn't also become a victim of that. And so that's why I and all the other lawyers here are going to vigorously defend our clients. Is he remorseful? You know, he is remorseful that he is attached to anything like this, that he is involved or connected to the death of somebody whose life should not have been taken. That is devastating to him. He must be remorseful that there is someone who died. Absolutely. Absolutely. Thank you, Blake Ballen. I appreciate you joining us. Thank you so much.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1252\n","\n","Link  145 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/ogouZdkOPMA\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/ogouZdkOPMA\n","[youtube] ogouZdkOPMA: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] ogouZdkOPMA: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 10.35MiB in 03:45\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Some of the Memphis police officers facing second degree murder charges related to the brutal killing of Tyree Nichols were members of the city's so-called Scorpion Unit. An attorney for the Nichols family says the city should immediately disband that group. CNN's Brian Todd is looking into the controversial unit for us. He's getting new information. What are you learning, Brian? Right. Well, this unit has not been in existence for very long but already has a history of controversy. And tonight, the attorneys for Tyree Nichols family calling on the police chief to take the swiftest, most decisive action against that unit. Asking Chief Davis to disband this Scorpion Unit effective immediately. Immediately. The intent of the Scorpion Unit has now been corrupted. Scorpion, standing for Street Crimes Operation to Restore Peace in Our Neighborhoods, is a specialized unit of the Memphis police created by the current chief, Sherrilyn C.J. Davis, in the fall of 2021 with a promo video accompanying its launch. Chief Davis told our Don Lemon they needed a unit to address a surge of violent crimes in Memphis. This is one of three teams whose primary responsibility is to reduce gun violence, to be visible in communities, and to also impact the rise in the crime. Basically out of an outcry from the community. We had record numbers in 2021, 346 homicides. Chief Davis says the Scorpion Unit at least initially had great success. Last year was the first year in a long time that we had reductions. The mayor's office also touted Scorpion's early success, saying that between its inception in the fall of 2021 through January of 2022, the unit made 566 arrests, seized more than 250 weapons, 270 vehicles, and over $100,000 in cash. But in its brief lifetime, there's already a history of tension between Scorpion officers and the community. Attorneys for Tyree Nichols' family say the unit goes around in unmarked cars and is sometimes unnecessarily aggressive. Family attorney Ben Crump relayed one account that a local man had also described to media outlets of his encounter with Scorpion. There's a brother who said four or five days before this happened to Tyree, that same Scorpion Unit confronted him while he was in this car going to get pizza. And he said that they used all kind of profanity against him. They threw him on the ground talking about where the drugs and where the weapons. And Crump said the officers pointed a gun at the man's head. CNN has reached out to the Memphis police for response to that account. We haven't heard back. One law enforcement veteran described issues that often crop up with specialized units in city police departments. Generally speaking, when we have an enforcement driven unit, these units have a greater propensity to rack up complaints against them based on excessive force. But the terminal piece in this is overall supervision. So I believe that we had a failure in supervision and there was no appropriate oversight to ensure that these officers were doing what they were supposed to do. Again, the Memphis Police Department has not responded to specific allegations of previous use of excessive force by the Scorpion Unit. But the Memphis police do tell CNN that unit and all other specialized units in the Memphis police force are going to undergo a review and that the Scorpion Unit is, quote, inactivated during the review process.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 573\n","\n","Link  146 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/8-yryyTe-tk\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/8-yryyTe-tk\n","[youtube] 8-yryyTe-tk: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 8-yryyTe-tk: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 6.41MiB in 01:45\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Tonight, massive missile attack. Putin launching 55 missiles across Ukraine as the Kremlin threatens the U.S. and its allies. Putin's top spokesperson saying sending Abrams and other tanks is, quote, direct involvement in the war. As the Pentagon says that the United States will be sending an updated Abrams tank to Ukraine, the M1A2, which is fully digital and allows for commanders and gunners to more easily scan and identify targets. Today's escalation of words and the barrage of missiles coming as CNN is learning that the war is intensifying in the South now. You're looking at new video from the city of Marinka. You can see multiple fires raging, smoke blanketing the city. And Fred Pleiken is out front. He is outside Bakhmut, where some of the fiercest fighting continues to rage tonight. Ukraine's tanks taking aim at the invading Russians. Kiev's forces rallying to try to halt the massive assault on Bakhmut. The city, where there are still some six thousand civilians, has become a cauldron of fire. From this vantage point, you can both see and hear just how fierce the fighting is. You can hear impacts from heavy weapons not just every minute, but literally every second. The Ukrainians say that the Russians are pouring a massive amount of personnel and weapons into this area because they seem to want to take Bakhmut at nearly any cost. There are plenty of regular Russian troops fighting around Bakhmut now, but the Ukrainians say it's still the Wagner private military company that's leading the charge, with waves of fighters trying to storm Ukrainian positions both north and south of the city, as well as specialized forces like these snipers claiming to have killed a Ukrainian soldier. All I could see was a curtained window, the sniper says. The person who was paired with me saw a thermal outline, and I just determined where to shoot. Wagner's boss, Yevgeny Prigozhin, often touts his militia's successes, but the cost is immense. This is a Wagner cemetery in the Krasnodar region of southern Russia. Row after row of fresh graves, a disposable force used to take just a few kilometers of land. Wagner acknowledges recruiting prisoners straight out of jail and throwing them on the battlefield with minimal training and only slim chances of survival. That same indifference shown in Russian strikes that kill and maim Ukrainian civilians every day. These folks are cleaning up after a Russian missile landed in their neighborhood near Bakhmut. We were getting heating from the heating plant, which was hit, Yuri tells me. Yesterday, at three o'clock, it was destroyed, so now we have no electricity, no heating. We have nothing. And a few miles away, one person was killed in another densely populated area. Some of the long distance drones and missiles that Russia uses to attack Ukraine come down right near civilian areas. This year is only a few yards away from a kindergarten. However, others are used to directly target critical infrastructure. More than 50 missiles fired just on Thursday. And while many of them were intercepted by Ukrainian air defenses, some were not brought down, adding to the daily toll of destruction. The missile terror, more motivation for Ukraine soldiers around Bakhmut to stand their ground and bring Vladimir Putin's invasion to a standstill. And Aaron, there's certainly some really brutal fighting that we witnessed around Bakhmut today. The Ukrainians say that the Russians are trying to encircle that city. And obviously, as you can see there, the Ukrainians themselves trying to do their best to stop that from happening. Meanwhile, the president, Vladimir Zelensky, he came out today and ripped into those missile strikes that the Russians once again conducted, calling for more air defense weapons, but of course, generally calling for more modern weapons from the West. He also praised the soldiers from the Ukrainian forces that are fighting here in Donetsk in the east of the country, saying that if they make a stand here, they could seriously deplete the combat power that Russia has available on other fronts as well. Aaron. Fred, thank you very much from just outside Bakhmut tonight. And I want to go down to the Russian investigative journalist, Andrei Soldatov. He is the author of The Compatriots, The Russian Exiles Who Fought Against the Kremlin. And Andrei, you've got some new reporting here. As Fred's talking about the Wagner group and still playing that central and kind of tip of the spear role near Bakhmut, you're reporting it's not just Wagner that's recruiting prisoners to aid in the Russian war effort, that this now goes much deeper, that the official Russian state is doing this as well. What did you discover? Yes, it looks like the Russian military factories are suffering from acute shortages in workforce. Even the Rostov-Bagon factory, which is the largest tank factory in the country, reported the lack of employees. So now they're going to use Russian convicts. And Russian convicts are already fighting on the battlefield in Ukraine. So now they're going to help to manufacture all these tanks and weaponry. So the formal state, the Russian state, recruiting convicts to build the tanks. And now to this point of your reporting, I want to play something that Putin said recently that speaks to what you're saying about the terrible state of the Russian defense industry right now. Here he is. Given that the defense industry is now overburdened, and given that you work in three shifts, and there is a high demand for military industrial products, we are now considering the possibility of granting deferment also to those who must be called up for compulsory military service. So it looks sounds like from what he's saying, they've offered anybody, you're going to come help us build the tanks and fix the defense supply problem, we'll defer your military service. But what you're reporting is that's not enough. They're still not able to get people to do it? Yes, absolutely. Actually, they started promising a protection from mobilization and the service in the army already in October. They also promised pensions, some good benefits, employment for the whole families, in some cases. All of that fell. They fell to find enough people to work on these factories. So now they think that only prison population of the country might help. And of course, it's a sign of desperation. Just think how reliable all these tanks and all these weaponry could be if they would be manufactured by completely unskilled workforce straight out of the prison. Straight out of the prison, and that they're emptying the prisons to do this and to fight on the front lines is absolutely stunning. Andre, thank you so much for sharing your latest reporting.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1131\n","\n","Link  147 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/SbSGWs_ZmmE\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/SbSGWs_ZmmE\n","[youtube] SbSGWs_ZmmE: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] SbSGWs_ZmmE: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 9.27MiB in 03:10\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Well, hello, you lovely people. You made it. A long week is now an almost gone week. It's Friday and you already know Friday is rock. I'm Koy Wire. This is CNN 10. And we're going to finish this week strong. First up, a new study on our planet. Earth rotates at about a thousand miles per hour, but new research published in Nature Geoscience says that the Earth's inner core may have actually stopped turning and now might start to spin in reverse. What does this mean? Well, the solid inner core of the Earth is located 3200 miles below the crust. That's roughly the size of Mars or a third of Earth's mass. And because that core is separated from the Earth's mantle by a liquid outer core, it allows the inner core to potentially rotate at a different speed from Earth's crust. The findings explain that seismic records taken since 2009 had always shown action, but they're now starting to show little difference, suggesting that the inner core's rotation has paused. The speed of the inner core's rotation and whether it varies though are debated. And at least one geophysicist not involved with this study says nothing cataclysmic is happening here. Scientists believe the spin of the inner core is driven by the magnetic field and balanced by the gravitational effects of the Earth's mantle. Knowing how the inner core rotates could shed light on how these layers interact and other processes deep in the Earth. Up next, we head to China where many families are reuniting for the first time in years. This week was the first week of Lunar New Year. It's the year of the rabbit. The most important holiday in China, which is widely celebrated across Asia, has always prompted what has become known as the world's largest human migration. Millions and millions of people returning to their hometowns to be with loved ones. But for the last three years, China has been locked down due to the country's zero COVID policy. But the nation has recently loosened its restrictions so people who work or study away from their hometowns feel free to travel again to see their family without the fear of getting locked down due to the virus. My friend, Selena Wang, our CNN international correspondent is in Beijing giving us a glimpse of what it's like to finally be able to fully celebrate Lunar New Year again. This year's celebration is particularly special. The adults around this table all work in factories in the cities. This is the only time when many of them can see their children. The man next to me says we got to go wherever we can make money and China's zero COVID policy over the last three years has made it all even harder. He says the policy prevented them from going home. But now that the country's open, they can all be together. We came to this place in China's southern Guizhou province to see how a part of rural China is celebrating the Lunar New Year without pandemic restrictions. About a thousand people live in this village and for hundreds of years, they've lived in these traditional wooden houses and you can hear the chickens crowing and there are these ducks as well that they raise for food. In many ways, this place is like a time capsule. This physical isolation has preserved their way of life for centuries. They're China's Dong ethnic minority. They have their own language, tradition and culture, but they can't escape the economic realities of modernity. Normally this village is full of the elderly and young kids with most of the working age adults gone, working in far away factories, sending money home. This couple works in a factory 500 miles away in Guangdong province, making circuit boards. He tells me he hasn't seen his kids for a year. Last time he left, his son couldn't even walk. He says it's emotional to see them grow so much. For the first time in three years, millions of Chinese migrant families are finally able to reunite without the fear of COVID lockdowns. Almost everyone I speak to on camera says no one around them has gotten COVID. Like this elderly woman who makes traditional crafts. She says she has not been wearing a mask and points to her shoulder saying she's had the vaccine shots. But we run into another group of young people who say otherwise. The man in the brown jacket with his back turned is a doctor at a hospital in a nearby city. He says almost all of the villagers have been infected. I asked him if they just don't realize they have COVID. In response, he says they've never been tested, but clearly they had COVID symptoms. So we've got the three government minders following us. It's common for local officials to keep a close eye on foreign journalists in their jurisdictions, but they were especially persistent in this village following our every move. So we drive out of the village to visit a public hospital in a neighboring county about two hours away, hoping these government minders won't follow us so people will feel more comfortable speaking freely. We walk inside the fever clinic. It's almost entirely empty. In the main hospital area, there are more people, but it's not packed. Soon after we realized we're being followed, apparently by a whole different crew. There's at least two, three government minders. They're still following us all the way here. It's very obvious. They follow us to hospital after hospital, preventing anyone from speaking to us. I try confronting them. I ask them why they're following us everywhere. And he ignores me. So I tried this official. She refuses to even acknowledge my question. And what happens next during my interview with this girl shocks us. Okay, so I was just interviewing the girl and then the minders literally took her away from us. The man pushes the girl and her family away, then later leaves them alone. But her interviews in the marketplace are over. China CDC says the COVID peak across the country has passed. But in rural areas like this, experts say there's likely far more silent suffering. Whether it's in the village or in faraway factories, they're hardworking people. They'll do whatever it takes to give their kids a better life, even if it means long bouts of separation from them, making reunions like these all the more meaningful. Ten second trivia. What is the process where pieces of ice break away from a glacier and create an iceberg, calving, stagnation, downwasting or foliation? Calving is the answer here. And an ice shelf in Antarctica just dropped a tremendous chip off the old ice block. An iceberg that's 600 square miles broke off in Antarctica on Sunday. That's the size of two New York cities or nearly the size of Greater London. This type of calving was one of the most major events we've seen in Antarctica in a long time. It broke free from one of the most closely observed ice shelves. An ice shelf is a large floating sheet of ice permanently attached to a landmass. Scientists had previously discovered cracks in this particular one, but two major breaks occurred in the last two years. Researchers say this event was expected, not the result of climate change, and they're going to continue to monitor its every move to ensure it's safe. Today's story getting a 10 out of 10 deserves a round of applause. Meet Spike, a Chihuahua mix hailing from Ohio, recently named the world's oldest living dog by Guinness World Records. Spike is 23 years old. According to American Kennel Club, a small dog that age would equate to 112 in human years. Spike's owner found her forever friend abandoned and injured in the parking lot of a grocery store back in 2009. But she says he has the attitude of a big dog, hence the name Spike. He enjoys going for walks on his family's farm, visiting the cows and horses in the barn. And when he has a rough day, he enjoys his favorite treats, sausage, cheese, and Doritos. He also likes taking naps. We see you Spike. All right, let's take great energy into this weekend. You never know who, you never know when, you never know how, but somehow you just might be the light someone needs this weekend. Shout out to Osborne High School in Marietta, Georgia.

New FEC filings suggest he did not. Then there are his recently uncovered claims that he was mugged in 2021 in broad daylight on Fifth Avenue here in New York and that the muggers even stole his shoes, he says. Also his claims that he survived an attempt on his life, although he didn't want to talk about it today with CNN's Manohar Raju. Why didn't you file a police report about your assassination attempt that allegedly happened? What about being mugged? Why didn't you file a police report about that? I have not. I haven't heard from a single authority or a team of investigations. Did you have a message? No real answers from the congressman on those questions about his claims. There is nothing though absurd about campaign finance is concerned. CNN's Jessica Dean joins us now with more on his answers about that. So what did congressman senators have to say about these amended FEC reports? Well Anderson, as you can imagine, not a ton of answers coming from the congressman today. And just to catch everybody up, he had previously said that he personally loaned his campaign some $700,000, just a little bit over that. Well then they amended these FEC filings recently, just in the past several days. And there are two loans, one for about $500,000, another for about $125,000. And the part where you would mark that it comes from personal funds is now not marked. So that's the big change. And there's been a lot of questions about where that money came from in the first place. And now this change in was it personal, was it not? Our colleague Manu Raju asked him about this as well and I'll let you see how that went. Why did you amend your FEC reports to say $500,000? Let's make it very clear. I don't amend anything. I don't touch any of my FEC stuff, right? So don't be disingenuous in report that I did because you know that every campaign hires fiduciaries. So I'm not aware of that answer. And we'll have an answer for the press regarding the amendment from yesterday. And just remember, he often likes to tell the press, tell us Anderson, that he'll be talking to us in the coming days, that he'll have answers tomorrow. And that has been going on now for weeks and weeks and weeks. And also important to remember that he really pushed this off on fiduciaries, on others, that it was not him that made these changes or was responsible. And I understand a political treasurer is saying that the Santos campaign listed him as overseeing their political accounts without his authorization. Right, and so that's why it's so important, right? That he's pointing to these others that are responsible for this because now we're learning that this Wisconsin-based political treasurer is saying, who is listed on these reports, is saying through a lawyer that he never agreed to be listed as his treasurer, to act as his treasurer. So this is obviously a giant discrepancy. This lawyer telling CNN that they had a conversation with Santos representatives on Monday, saying they would not agree to serve as a treasurer. And yet there is what this lawyer is calling a disconnect between that conversation and what got filed in these FEC reports. And Anderson, to your point from earlier, you just don't mess around with these federal documents. If you are caught lying on these, that is a very, very serious federal crime. Speaker McCarthy discussed the Santos situation at a closed conference meeting today. Do we know anything about that, what he said? We know, yeah, we know a little bit. So these are, this is their conference meeting that they have where they all come together. We do know based on sources in the room that he did talk a little bit about this. But the bottom line that he said is there is a difference between lying and committing a crime. And committing a crime is what gets you kicked off your committees. And he reiterated this public stance that he's had again and again, which is the voters, it's up to the voters. They put him into office. It's up to the voters ultimately to get him out of office. He did say earlier this week, Anderson, if he is found by the ethics committee to have committed a crime, that he would be removed. But that's going to take a very long time for that process to even play out. At this point, he's gonna stay on here in Congress. And as we know, he's been assigned to a couple of committees and the work will continue for him. So lies are okay, just not a crime. Jessica Dean, thanks very much. To help understand how Republicans in the House are approaching all this, we're joined now by former Illinois Republican Congressman Joe Walsh. He's currently host of the White Flag podcast. Congressman Walsh, thanks for being with us. Across the board, I mean, it seems like a complete mess with Santos. How does this compare to other ethically challenged liars you've seen? Anderson, that's such a great question. Look, this should matter. His FEC filing should matter. It looks like, and there ought to be an FEC full investigation or a full audit. It looks like there are major FEC violations here, but will that matter to Kevin McCarthy and House Republicans? Anderson, I doubt it because we now know the line doesn't matter. The line doesn't matter at all. And the line doesn't matter in this party for a lot of reasons, Anderson, but we have to keep reminding ourselves that the leader of this party remains Donald Trump. And so it's really difficult for Republicans to penalize another Republican for lying when Donald Trump is its leader. Regarding the FEC and finance laws, I mean, are the punishments for that all that severe? I mean, are they financial or is it really anything to be concerned about? Typically not. Typically, FEC violations can be a slap on the wrist, Anderson, to members of Congress. But looking at what Santos did, my God, these are the sloppiest filings we've ever seen, or there's some real campaign finance fraud going on here. I wanna place- But Kevin McCarthy is the speaker, Anderson. He needs all he cares about is remaining speaker. And so he's not gonna do anything to Santos unless literally there are serious financial crimes he's committed. I wanna place something that Speaker McCarthy said last night about restoring integrity to the House Intelligence Committee by stripping committee assignments away from certain Democrats. This is not anything political. This is not similar to what the Democrats did, but integrity matters. And they have failed in that place from Adam Schiff using a position of the Intel chair lying to the American public again and again. I'm wondering what you make of that. I mean, it's interesting him calling out what he says are lies in that case. Anderson, when I listened to McCarthy there, it just doesn't sound like him. I served with McCarthy. That's not him. I think Kevin McCarthy knows that what he's doing to Adam Schiff and Swalwell is wrong. But McCarthy has no choice because he won't be speaker if he's not seen as fighting these fights. And we make a big mistake on TV and in the media when we think that there are only 15 to 20 mega extremists in the House Republican Conference. Remember, the vast majority of that conference is now mega. The vast majority of House Republicans are election deniers or January 6th, sympathizers. McCarthy doesn't have just a couple crazies like Lauren Boebert to deal with. It's his whole conference. Joe Walsh, I appreciate your time tonight. Thank you.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1343\n","\n","Link  149 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/5lGAqzGg3Qk\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/5lGAqzGg3Qk\n","[youtube] 5lGAqzGg3Qk: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 5lGAqzGg3Qk: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 2.29MiB in 00:47\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  I want to bring you into a topic we haven't heard from you on yet. I've talked to experts and lawyers about this really effective set of defamation lawsuits against the Fox News empire over lies. We've kind of gone through the legalities of it. I did a breakdown of it. But there's a whole political component to this, where, as you know, plenty of people like to push the envelope or have a reputation for doing so in these political worlds. And yet we all know if you go too far, you fly too close to the sun, you may burn up. And going too far doesn't just mean how the Fox News audience or the base feels. It might mean, in the case of this lawsuit, that some anchors over there went so far that they end up costing their employer not, you know, a million dollars or $10 million, which is a lot of money, or $100 million, which a corporation would notice, but $1.6 billion. And I'm going to show an example for stuff like this from Hannity. Dominion came under heavy fire after allegations that their machines caused thousands of votes in one Michigan county to be switched from Donald Trump to Joe Biden. When you look at this story, outside of the law, which we've covered, do you see it as having any potential impact on that Fox News empire and some of those people? I think it has very strong impact on Fox News. I think Fox News knows going forward that repeating these sorts of lies will have legal consequence, financial consequence for them. I think that's something that they definitely are going to be thinking about. I do also think this has been something that's occurred in the shift in their programming. As we've chronicled, they've gone from Trump to DeSantis more. DeSantis is somebody who kind of understands much better than Donald Trump did some of these lines, these legal lines, you know, where you want to cross. DeSantis is a seasoned politician. He's been in politics his whole life. He kind of understands what you can get away with and what you can't get away with. And I do think that part of the pivot from Trump to DeSantis is not just a political pivot, it also might be a financial pivot. I think Rupert Murdoch is like, you know, Trump is costing us a lot of money, but there's nonsense. We need to get off that train.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 419\n","\n","Link  150 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/Ri-WxyyXgFg\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ri-WxyyXgFg\n","[youtube] Ri-WxyyXgFg: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] Ri-WxyyXgFg: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 4.75MiB in 01:09\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  I do want to get back into the headlines here and on Friday body cam video was released showing the attack on paul Pelosi the husband of then house speaker Nancy Pelosi in their San Francisco home Nancy Pelosi was not home at the time But the video itself is fairly graphic as the suspect hits paul Pelosi in the head with a hammer Evan sorovski with our Fox 2 San Francisco team takes a closer look at that video Drop the hammer stunning video released Friday of the attack on former speaker of the house Nancy Pelosi's 82 year old husband Paul Pelosi It shows defendant David de pap and Paul holding a hammer in the entryway of the Pelosi home De pap then smashes Pelosi in the head knocking him unconscious Pelosi was hospitalized for several days with a fractured skull He still hasn't fully recovered Officials also released this video of the defendant breaking in shortly before the attack Police were called to the home in Pacific Heights after getting this cryptic 911 call from Paul Pelosi This gentleman just came into the house and he wants to wait here for my wife to come home Do you know who the person is?

L.J. is with us, and Fox News contributor and former D.C. homicide detective Ted Williams, thank you all for being with us. L.J., let me start with you. You watch this tape, you see this tape, and I know so many people in law enforcement. And I was looking for these five guys there against one young man. And obviously they have the advantage. They're pulling out their stun guns. They're pulling out pepper spray. They're, you know, they're mad. They're angry. At no time did I hear anyone say, sir, sir, everybody calm down. We're not going to hurt you. We're not here to hurt you. But we do have to take you into custody. We really need your cooperation. Tone could mean everything. I heard nothing but anger, like real anger. And you see the physicality here. We're talking about five on one. That part, I'm having a hard time. That is not the policing that I believe officers are trained in. You know, Sean, we've done this a lot. We review the facts, the evidence, and we don't rest the judgment. But you can't deny what you see on tape. And I'm not just talking for myself. I'm talking about the officers that I've been texting back and forth. Sean, when you brought me to the channel, I've been covering crime for a long time. I know a lot of cops. Talked to them on a day-to-day basis. And they're all horrified. They want to wish their condolences to the Nichols family. But, Sean, there were several things in this video that stood out to me. You come to the scene out of control, out of control. You disobey police policy. You don't just roll up on a car like that. You don't know what the suspect could possibly have. You put yourself at risk. And then you slaughter the suspect. You started to spray each other with the spray because you're not using it the right way. You use your Taser the wrong way. You use your batons the wrong way. You didn't restrain the suspect the right way. I mean, that's just basic police protocol. And then I just can't get past the fact that you held the suspect up and you beat him. You took turns. You used your baton in the wrong way. And then I just can't help but be annoyed by the fact that they fist-bumped at the end. So there were many layers to this—basic police protocol was broken right here. They were on a power trip. And he didn't have to die that night. He was crying out for his mom. Again, they have the right to defend themselves in the court of law. But just from a tactics standpoint, basic police protocol—Sean, I started off when I was 16 years old as a police explorer. I know protocol. And they broke every rule in the book. You know, Geraldo, L.J. is right. He's crying for his mom at one point. He's literally getting punched and kicked and pepper sprayed and tasered. And you know, there's five cops there. They're supposed to be the trained professionals in a situation. Look, he was obviously scared, obviously felt they were being overly aggressive from the get-go and said, so, hey, guys, there's a lot going on here. Early on, there was nobody there that tried to even defuse it. And then, you know, to watch as one cop just come walking in disgusted and just kick this kid in the head, not once, but twice. You know, a kick in the head kills people, Geraldo. You know, Sean, this wasn't five cops. This was a wolf pack. This was a cowardly, sadistic bunch of brutes who murdered a man right before our very eyes. That's the most eerie thing about it. You're watching a dead man screaming for his mother. I mean, it is outrageous. It is the most pathetic thing I've ever seen. And where the hell was a police sergeant? Where was a supervisor? You have these five macho cops out there who—I don't know how much training they had. Their instinct was to lash out, was to inflict pain, was to torture this young man to death. It is really—it makes me want to puke. It is the most sickening thing I've ever seen in terms of police brutality. And the way that one cop kind of winds up and then goes 10, 15 feet to land a blow, a kick to the victim's head, and then another kick, and then the other one takes a turn, and he's obviously defenseless. I mean, it is really—when I first heard the charges of Murder 2, I said, wow, that's pretty serious, this early in the game. But when you see this, it is clear that this was reckless disregard for human life. This is Murder 2 at least. Ted Williams, I—like Geraldo, like LJ, I know a lot of police officers. And I'm watching, and I see five cops around him, and I find it almost spectacularly unbelievable to me that five trained officers, obviously lacking in a lot of training, that they can't cuff one young man and they can't get control of the situation, and they all let their—seemingly all of them, most of them, anyway—let their tempers get the better of them. They took it so personally. There was no attempt to diffuse the situation in any way, which I believe easily could have been done. There was even simple jujitsu, 101 maneuvers could have, you know, enabled the police to easily cuff this guy. But none of them seemed to have any of that training at all. The only training that they seem to be—they only seem to be trained to be angry. And I'm not sure where the anger came from. There are always going to be people during an arrest that don't want to be arrested. That is part of the job. But them doing it professionally has to happen. That didn't happen here. Why? Well, you asked an excellent question. You have to first go back and ask, where was the humanity of these police officers? The first thing we see in the first video, they are coming up aggressively to this man's car, and they don't talk to the man. They rip him out of his automobile, and they immediately start pepper-scraping him. But then, Sean, if you go to the video 4 that was on the lamppost, you see how inhumane these officers are. They are kicking this man in the head. They are beating him. They are saying, show me your hands, or give me your hands. While they're still, the man is in pain. And he's calling for his mother. And he says, initially, when they took him out of that car, Sean, he said, why? I didn't do anything wrong. I didn't do anything wrong. Sean, this is just terribly outrageous. But Sean, let me make sure we are clear here. Black men and women who are dead and children are crying from the grave. We didn't do anything. This is an excellent example, unfortunately, what has happened to black people throughout the history of this country. And I'm very, very upset about these four or five black officers, black officers treating another black man the way they treated this man. This was—you don't even treat a dog this way. This was just unhumane. And I think Heraldo is right. Where in the hell was the supervisor? Why wasn't the supervisor there on the scene supervising this situation? You have to ask yourself, how do you drag a man— Where was the—there wasn't one of these five officers, Ted. But Ted, there wasn't one of these officers that didn't have enough sense training to stand back, objectively realize everyone's getting out of control, call for calm, let their professionalism take over, talk to the suspect, talk him down, talk calmly, say, it's going to be all right. Nobody wants to get hurt here. We want to make sure that we take care of you as well. We have our job to do. Help us do our job. Judge, I— Tone, cadence— They don't—you're out of that? You know, that matters in a moment like that. You're absolutely right, Sean. They were after when they got to the crime scene. Oh, Jay, go ahead. They were after when they got there, Sean. And can I just say this? Because I think it's important to say this. Cops are the only profession that are judged by the individuals, the very few that do the wrong thing. They didn't just steal someone's life. They set the profession back. Prepare for months of rage. Prepare for cops to be demonized over the actions of these people. They took this man's life. The other cops, the 95 percent that go out there and put a badge on every single day—you got to remember, Sean, we're already dealing with limited people in the profession. Way to go. Way to set us back, because now we're going to have to deal with some people stepping back as a result of this. And, Lawrence, this is what's going on. In the profession right now, we've got a lot of experienced police officers who are leaving the profession, and they are leaving—and you've got these inexperienced cops out there that are doing the job. This is what's also going on in the profession. And yes, you're right, Lawrence. This sets the profession back. There are good men and women who put that uniform on every day and go out here and serve and protect the communities. These officers do not deserve to wear the uniform of Memphis, Tennessee, as police officers. Not a chance. Geraldo, in this particular case, the suspect was African American. The five cops involved were African Americans. There's a so-called news network. It's a comedy channel, I guess. You have Van Jones saying that the police that killed Tyree Nichols were black, but they might still have been driven by racism. He says black people are not immune to anti-black messages. One of the sad facts about anti-black racism is that black people ourselves are not immune to its pernicious effects. And society's message that black people are inferior, unworthy and dangerous is pervasive. And it's not just Van Jones. It's the communication workers of America. It's NPR. It's Al Sharpton. It's the attorney Ben Crump, who our colleague John O. talked to earlier tonight. Where does that come from here? You know, Sean, Memphis, Tennessee, is where, tragically, in April 1968, Martin Luther King was assassinated. Since then, the city has been roiled by racial tension. It is now predominantly black city with soaring crime. The police force is consistently undermanned. They are desperate for officers. They are searching for recruits everywhere. I don't know whether they've relaxed their standards or what the result is. All I know is what my eyes tell me after a half-century in this business dealing with law and order and cops, of all—of all colors. What I see here are—Mandor—just, they reduced themselves to savage, to—I used the term wolfpack earlier. It was so uncontrolled. It was so undisciplined. It was so slanderously unprofessional. And Lawrence is right. And Ted is—Ted's anguish is poignant. And Lawrence is right about setting back the shortage that we have now with cops after George Floyd and all these other incidents that have happened. It's so chronic. What the result of this will be is that that neighborhood will be more resentful of the cops. There will be more crime. There will be harder for them to recruit officers. This is a—this is a body blow to law and order, to race relations. This is really awful. But if the protesters use this as an excuse to inflict more pain— Geraldo, let me ask you, though. When you say it's a body blow—Geraldo, when you say it's a body blow to racism, where's the racial component here? Now, there are good cops and there are bad cops. And to me, it has nothing to do with race. There are professional cops, as Ted said, as L.J. said, as you said, that get up, put on that uniform. They know they're risking their lives, but they go to work every day to serve their communities and protect their communities. That transcends race to me. And in this case, there are just so many people trying to make this racial. Is this case racial? Because I don't see it. The point is, Sean, I agree that what this does is strip race from the question of police training and police brutality. But you cannot avoid the reality that these were five black men, young black men, macho, spriticor, filled with verve and grit— That's not what I asked you, though. —and they joined the police force. Is this racial? And now look what they have done. But look—but my point is this. Look what they have done now. Look what they have done. But the blow that they have struck to the community. It's a—let me— Let me say this, Sean. Let me— LJ, I'll ask you the same question. This is a humanity issue. Your thoughts on the racial component, to me— This is a humanity issue. —it's about—sorry. I'm sorry, LJ. Go ahead. It's a humanity issue, Sean. I see where you're going with it. This is not having value for human life. This didn't have to go this way, whether he resisted or not. They didn't value his life. And apparently they didn't value their own life the way that they showed up to the scene. You don't go up to a car that way. That's basic police 101. And look, I agree with my colleague that training is an issue within some of the police departments right now, especially when it comes to the numbers that we have right now. But let's not be confused here. These gentlemen were a part of an elite unit, the Scorpions, OK? It is equivalent to New York City's anti-crime unit. It takes grit to be on there, OK? I understand the job that they have to do, which is why they should have had the proper training to conduct that stop. And they didn't do it the right way. It was selfish on multiple levels to the cops that served that do the job the right way. But it's also, if we want to—since people want to put race in this, Sean, every black man knows about the talk that our father gives us, what you're supposed to do when you're stopped by a police officer. We have gentlemen that got the talk, as well as our black police officers. So they just didn't value life. They didn't care about any of that in that moment. All right, L.J., thank you.

Lawrence, thank you so much for taking time tonight, for being here on this Saturday evening while you're preparing for your own show. I just wanna get your thoughts as all of this unfolds and we just saw a few of the highlights of that really horrific video. Yeah, I was warned about this video. I think the Tennessee governor is an honorable man. I think that the colonel that leads the Department of Public Safety is honorable. A lot of my sources said this was one of the worst they've seen in their department ever, naturally. But I don't think anyone could be prepared for what they saw in that video. You were expecting some sort of resistance, even in the midst of just beating the living hell out of this guy. It seemed personal. It makes you ask what happened before. I don't think I've ever seen one cop hold up a citizen and they take turns on beating the individual. I believe they arrived at the scene totally out of control. They broke so many police policy. They didn't just put his life at risk, but if they were conducting any other stops like that, they put their own lives at risk. You never go at a car that way. You never go in and drag someone out of the car. It's clear that they did not know how to use their batons the right way. They were spraying each other with the mace, cross firing, the Taser. I mean, it was just everything that you should not do as an officer, they did that night. And there's a personal side of this. Growing up wanting to be a cop, covering crime on this network every single day. I'm with cops every single day. I have so many sources in different police departments. All of them condemn this, by the way. I haven't heard not one cop defend this. But to have black officers who understand the disconnect between the community. I had a friend that was a social justice warrior who criticized cops all the time and became a cop and saw policing from a different perspective. He wanted to bridge the gap. To have these officers that understand black America and are also members of the blue make life worse for more cops, I mean, the consequences of this, I don't think we really understand. Because there's already a low recruitment right now for cops. A lot of people don't want to do the job. We're literally dealing with what's left right now. There's going to be more people that resign for law enforcement. The damage and distrust that individuals are going to have with cops are going to go on. I say this not as if it's fair. But cops are the only profession that you're judged by the actions of few. There's a lot of bad doctors out there. People don't have hesitation when they go to the doctor. There's a lot of bad dentists out there. There's a lot of bad journalists, right? But cops are judged by the actions of a few. And the fact that they were black cops as well also creates a whole another layer of this. It's sad all around. I grieve for his family. I grieve for his mom. I think it's important to note that unlike some of the other situations where we've heard people scream out for their mom, his mom was about three streets away. When he was screaming for his mom, he was screaming for mom, come save me. We're talking about a skateboarder, OK? Lawrence, you mentioned that a lot of the police that you work with every day, the sources that you're in connection with all the time about these issues are furious over what they saw in that video. The president of the Fraternal Order of Police, Patrick Yost, released a lengthy statement calling this criminal assault under the pretext of the law. He was appalled. It was not legitimate police work. He also said that his horror was compounded by watching other officers start engaging and not stop what he called the assault on this young man. But on the news that the police chief has disbanded the Scorpion Unit, which stands for street crimes operations to restore peace in our neighborhoods, which was a special unit that was made up of 40 officers that was developed in October of 2021. And at the time, the assistant police chief said, we have this unit to go to high crime areas to focus on auto theft, gang-related crime, drug-related incidents, because people in these communities need to be able to go to the grocery store without feeling like they are going to be assaulted or shot. It's been disbanded permanently at the request of the Nichols family instead of just a review. Now, will that have consequences for the very people who live in these neighborhoods who have seen an increase in violent crime? And they need good cops to be there. They don't need police to be taken out of their communities. They need good cops to be put in. And you mentioned the recruiting numbers are so low that you get bad cops who are taking these jobs. You know, I look at it from two different sides. So this scorpion unit is much like the New York's anti-crime unit. They're plain clothes. They have plain. And you give these groups a little bit of rope because you're policing the worst of the worst. You're not talking about your daily civilian. And so you do need these units. When we got rid of them in New York, we saw the consequences of it. Now, on the other hand, you have five members of this unit that some of them were five years, three years. Every single case that they have been involved in is going to be under review right now. And the question is, where was the leadership, what was the sergeant in the unit in the middle of all of this taking place? So if there is a real issue with the unit, then I have no problem disbanding it. But if this is just at the moment and not waiting until there is a full review to see what the problem is, then they may be creating more chaos. And that goes back to my initial point, that as a result of this, because of what these five officers did, they can disband it. But in general, law enforcement will step back. They will step back and be cautious, even though these officers don't speak for the 95%, 96% of men and women that wear the badge. It's just going to be the reaction. One question I had was, I don't understand why these officers were so whipped up. I mean, the ride-alongs I've gone on, the police officers, they're incredibly disciplined. They take their time. They resist the temptation, I think, to hit back. But you're right. When they roll up on that scene, we see that video. They are in such a fury that they abandon everything they were supposedly to be trained on. But I'm curious as to why they were so adamant and so whipped up when they went into this scene. You know, Jason, I have that same question. Molly and I were talking before we got on air. And I said, you know, judging by the way they conducted themselves, and as someone that is criminal justice major, been around cops pretty much every single day, I don't know if I would have ran. I may have ran myself in the way that they engage. When you have a law enforcement officer say that I'm going to break your arm, I mean, there were some... It gets to the point, is it flight or fight at this moment? I mean, what they did was not... I mean, one of the charges is kidnapping, which tells me that the DA has concluded that it was an unlawful seizure at that point, an unlawful arrest. So I mean, there are so many policies that were being broken. I wonder why they were amped up. Was it another call that they were on before? That can be discussed. I've discussed this before about putting the officers on call after call, going from a murder scene, going back into the community police. That's a conversation that we can have. I think that's fair. But it doesn't justify what took place that night. Absolutely. Well, what about this... What do you know about this Scorpion unit? Or what have you heard? Because, you know, is it likely that this is rogue cops? Or was there a culture within this Scorpion unit? That's the first thing I think of, is that why do people behave this way? And if you're scratching your head and you're saying, this doesn't make any sense, maybe it makes sense in that there was an unwritten rule of the way that they were able to conduct business and it was not according to the usual protocols. You know what, Tom? I think that's why we have to have the full investigation. Bring the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation. They'll get to the bottom of it. They're not wokesters. The Colonel is a guy that believes in law and order and accountability, but he's a cop's cop as well. I think we should get to the facts on that. But again, I think it would be unfair of leadership, because with these units, they give them some rope to go into these communities. That doesn't mean they break protocol or anything. But the way they conduct themselves is not the typical way. They're going against gang bangers. So you can't tell cops to go in there and do that and then punish them for it. Now, if there has been a legal content going on in there, if they've been abusing members of the public and it's systemic, then you gotta disband the unit and start all over. All right, Lawrence Jones, thank you very much for joining us, giving us a little bit of your time as you get ready for your show.

He revealed why he thinks free speech is under attack. I'm not even mad that they take issue with my work. Good, fine. What I take issue with is the idea that because they don't like it, I'm not allowed to say it. Art is a nuanced endeavor. I have a belief that they are trying to take the nuance out of speech in American culture, but they're making people speak as if they're either on the right or the left. Everything seems absolute. In any opinion I respect, there's way more nuance than these binary choices that they keep putting in front of us. I don't see the world in red or blue. It's just people I agree with on some things, but not other things. It's just what it is. All right. I want to go straight to you, Tom, because you're funny. Oh, wow. And it's hard to be funny when the woke people mob are behind you breathing down your neck. Yeah. I feel bad for Dave Chappelle because he had a very left-wing audience. He had to wrestle with that. I never really had him. I mean, it's not as if it was... Auntie Fah was never coming to my shows anyway. My audience sees me on here. They come out and see me. It's just most of the time my audience already knows I'm right-wing. I'm not shocking anybody, but when I go around to the clubs and work out material, I'll just show up on a Wednesday night and I'll do a set. They can't stand me. And I'm not even radical. I'm not talking about politics. I don't mention anything about red or blue or anything. I just talk about the fact that I'm married. I love my wife. I grew up in the 70s. And the kids are like, what? Who is this guy talking about, man? He's a brave man. Yeah. You have a better music choice than all those kids, though, if you grew up in the 70s. Very true. That is for sure. Yeah. This is divulged into not just protests and cancellations from venues. It's also...he's been on the opposite end of receiving end of violence as a result of this. Remember when Isaiah Lee was a suspect carrying a replica gun and a knife blade? He jumped on the stage and tackled Dave Chappelle when he was playing at the Hollywood Bowl in 2022 last year. So it's just...what happened to a live, let live? If you're going to be offended, you don't have to listen to it. I mean, you can literally turn it off if you don't want to watch it. I'm a huge Dave Chappelle fan. It's a little rude, little crude, it's not for everybody. But if you really listen to what Dave Chappelle is saying, if you really kind of break it down, he's making a point that I think most people would look at it and say, wow, okay, I like that. But you know, he is 110% right. Just because somebody else doesn't like it doesn't mean you just have to shut it down. So I think Dave Chappelle is spot on. He is one of the funniest guys in this country. But you really have to kind of listen to it. Again, it's not for everybody. Careful out there. It's definitely... Tom's a loser for everybody, though. It's definitely tolerated. I get that. I mean, I'm right in the middle. Except a few people at those clubs. Actually, let's take a listen to Dave Chappelle, because that's just fun. And here's why he thinks people protest him. I feel like they wanted me to say something inflammatory. In a weird way, I think some of them had the intention of inciting violence against themselves for publicity. Oh, attention seekers. Worse than the hecklers, perhaps, that go after you, Tom. I don't know. Yeah, it is. Well, I mean, you know, that's why I've always been kind of right there in the middle. Never really became a blockbuster. Why? Because, you know, my comedy's just nice. It's kind of fun. I'm not breaking any new ground. But look, there's a reason why Gutfeld is like the number one comedy show at night. And I saw you in person. You came and played in Salt Lake City. And the audience loved it. It was fun stuff. It was great. It's just nice. It's like, you know, cream of wheat. I mean, I like when you show up looking like Joe Biden. I'm surprised you didn't show up for the classified documents segment looking like that. They don't know my secrets, you know. They always want... You show up as Biden, I say, no, that's all hocus pocus. It's all filters. Yeah. He's right about nuance, though, right? Like, people don't have the patience to want to understand nuanced opinions. And this happens a lot in politics. Well, there's shows, the old shows, that they would never be able to make. I mean, do you think they could make The Office in today's environment? I don't know that they could. Yeah. But that's not even that old. It's not even that old. Never mind the shows that I grew up on, Barney Miller, you know. And Chappelle's comedy, to your point, is complex. I mean, it does require some critical thinking rather than this just surface level reaction to what he's actually saying, kind of like poetry, right? You dig deep and read between the lines. And so I think if people want to be lazy about their intellectual ability, they can just protest and scream and try to get people canceled rather than maybe thinking about having a real debate and thinking critically about what he's trying to say and that maybe there are some nuanced arguments to be made about how we deal with huge cultural issues that he's willing to take on in mainstream settings in comedy clubs. And sometimes protesters, like he says, they just want to protest. So it almost doesn't matter what he says. So he should just say what he wants to say, which I think he chooses to do. Yep. Indeed.

Memphis police released the body camera video showing the brutal beating of Tyree Nichols. His mom describes her grief after the death of her son. I felt a lot of pain and discomfort in my stomach. And at the time I didn't realize what it was. But once I found out, then I just said that was my son's pain that I was feeling. Here to react, the author of a brand new memoir, straight shooter, Stephen A Smith. My friend, it's been a long time. It's been a long time, man. It's good to see you. How you doing? Good to see you. You know, we were going to have you today to talk about straight shooter. We can touch on it a bit later. But in the wake of this incident, in the wake of the video, in the protest last night, you were no better guest to hear from this morning than Stephen A Smith. It was an atrocity. There's no question about it. My heart goes out to Tyree Nichols' family, of course him. He was tortured. He was beaten. And as far as I'm concerned, second degree murder does it to begin to touch on what these officers deserve. They took his life. And as far as I'm concerned, the five officers involved, their life should be taken, meaning they should be in prison for the rest of their lives. I don't know whether that will happen. Of course, we'll let the judicial system reach that conclusion. But what I wanted people to point to remember was that if you're watching this video, and I watched all 66 minutes of it, if you watch the video with the body cam, there is a point, a significant chunk of time where you can't see what is going on, but you hear the officers screaming, put your hands behind your back and all of this other stuff. They already had him restrained. They already had him in their possession. Then the surveillance cam from across the street is what caught them. You saw two officers holding him down. You saw another officer come and kick him in the face twice. You saw another officer come out of nowhere and grab the nightstick or the baton, whatever word you want to use, and struck him at least twice. They beat him to death. There is no way around it. And as far as I'm concerned, obviously something needs to be done. But I do think it's important to call for peaceful protest and to recognize the fact that the system itself appears to be working the way it always should. They were immediately fired. They were immediately indicted. Okay, the charges have been placed against them. And the process has been expedited and it's moved with the quickness, and I'm very happy about that. You know, that's what I wanted to talk to you about. And look, you and I have a long history of having honest disagreement with one another on various serious issues. There is universal agreement, I think, right now. This is horrific. It's an injustice. And more than that, it's a crime. When you see this incident, Stephen A., do you see the indictment of a few bad apples in a police department, individuals? Or do you see something systemic, a problem here that needs to be addressed at a large level? I definitely think it's systemic, but that doesn't mean that all police officers would do this. The systemic, where the systemic part comes in is the fact that you had five police officers, nobody stops you. And so what we're looking at, of course, there's a few bad apples. Of course, not every police officer would do this. Of course, this is a stain on the men in blue, people who swore on, men and women, people who swore to protect and serve. And nobody should castigate them as a group. But as a black man, what you're saying is, is that when this kind of stuff happens, call them out. Because if you're going to stand by and do nothing, you're a part of the problem. If you're somebody that's wearing that blue uniform, you should feel just as bad, if not worse, towards those police officers who did this because they stained you. They really impugned your integrity and what you stand for. And you just, you have to be just as diligent as you expect American citizens and, dare I say, a jury of our peers to be. Black folks put black folks in jail all the time. We do not hesitate. So what we want everybody else to do from different ethnicities, different communities, is to do the same. When you're wrong, you're wrong. Deal with it on that level. Do you see this in any way as an issue of race? Well, I do see it as an issue of race in this regard in terms of what has happened to the young black man. We don't see this happening to white individuals. Now, if it has happened and we haven't seen it, we haven't seen it. Maybe they need to show us more of that. But the reality of the situation is that when you're talking about unarmed individuals who are getting beat up or brutalized by police officers, they're usually black men. In that regard, that's the race issue. But with Freddie Gray in Baltimore, some of those officers were black. It wasn't just white officers that did that to Freddie Gray. There were black officers too. I'm talking about race from a victim's perspective. The victims are usually black unarmed males. When that issue happens, when it's unarmed males, it's usually young black males that this happens to. And how do you explain that? Well, I think that from a systemic perspective, we think about the way black folks in this country are, the kind of messages that are disseminated to the masses about us, how we're depicted plays a role. And obviously, that doesn't mean that there isn't some legitimacy to it on a case by case basis. But the important word- Or broader statistics when an officer goes into an involvement, he understands as well the neighborhood I'm in, the prevalence for the crime that could be committed. So a lot of that's playing into- It plays into it all. And we understand that. But at the end of the day, that's why training comes into play. That's why, see, I've never been a proponent of defunding the police. Absolutely not, as far as I'm concerned. Throw more money into law enforcement. Except, you know, you do that so they can receive the proper training and to make sure they know how to navigate their way through the holidays. Just like Dan Benjino said when he came on a bit earlier, you're not trained to do what we saw transpire. No. Those are guys that are rogue. Highlight those individuals. But if you're a part of the police force, and you've been trained, and you know to do better, then part of your obligation is to stop your contemporaries, your colleagues from engaging in such heinous acts. The fact that nobody stopped you. We had just- this is just the five officers that were arrested. What about the other officers who came to the scene? They did nothing. They did nothing. What about the EMT workers? They came ten minutes later. You were slow to address the concerns that were clearly obvious. So when you see stuff like that happens, there's something systemic to it. I'm not an expert. I'm not going to pretend to be. So I'm not going to go any further than that. But I'm looking at what most American people are looking at today. They're appalled. It's a heinous act as far as I'm concerned. It should have been first degree murder charges. And who's to say that's not going to happen down the road? They tortured and beat this kid to death. They have got to pay. You and I will continue this conversation and many more about your life, about straight shooter, your rise to stardom at ESPN and beyond on the Will Cain podcast which comes out this coming Monday. I know you went live last night on the No Mercy podcast which you can check out at YouTube and wherever you get your podcasts. Get Unfiltered Steven A, which you always get.

Actually tried to be built a. Let's follow birthday. Um. April 14th. 1999 put it up as wide as you can. That's fine. You said 99. Sir, he was born in 99. He's born April 14th, 1999. What's your what's your first answer? My name is Alex Richard Alexander Murdock. Yes. Let me ask you this in your interactions with Mr Murdock. Was he able to understand your questions and respond appropriately to what you were asking? Yes, was he catatonic in any way? No, he was able to answer all the questions that I asked him. Was he panicking in any way? He seemed upset, but I wouldn't say panicky. Did you notice any labor breathing or anything like that from Mr Murdock? Yeah, he. Was breathing heavily, never once did he complain about not being able to breathe. I mean, there were fire rescue guys out there. He didn't ask for any kind of medical attention or anything like that due to not being able to breathe. Richard Alexander Murdock. Chiefs of Mayor with location. No. No. Hey Cody, come around the truck and then go to the building. Come around the truck and then. Yes, what's that? The failure there too. Is that individual right there? I'm not sure of his name. I just know that he works for the Calton County Fire Rescue. What do you have work for? Carlton County Fire Rescue. In the background in the center of the screen looks like somebody is doing something with some yellow tape. Can you explain what that is to the jury? Please, that's correct. That's Deputy Pruitt, one of the deputies that I supervised. I instructed him to put up crime scene tape to include that vehicle. Just to we put up crime scene tape to try to keep people out of the immediate crime scene area preserve preserve any possible evidences there. At this point in time, did you notice any evidence of firearms such as casings or spent shells or anything like that? Yeah, as I was walking through, you can't necessarily see it on my body camera, but as I was walking through, I could see shell casings, particularly around Maggie's body. And a shell casing would they be for like a rifle round or pistol round? They appear to be rifle rounds. And could you tell just from walking by what type of ammunition at that point in time? I couldn't tell what type I could tell that they appear to be rifle. That's about it. And again, you weren't stopping to collect as you were you were managing the scene as you described before. That's correct. Let's go over to that corner of the building. I'm almost here. Let me see what we have first, whether or not we'll handle that part or not. What are you shining your light on right there? So there in the background behind where Mr. Murdoch is standing, you can see several sets of tire tracks. The grass was really wet that night, so those tracks appeared to be really fresh. It caught my eye. And why did it catch your eye? It just seemed odd that there were it appeared to be that many sets of tire tracks since he said he pulled up, went to the house and came back. It just appeared that there were more than just that. It appeared that there were more tracks than just that. That's correct. I see quite a few tire tracks in here. Were any of these you going in and out? No, I came in here and I left one time and I came back. OK. OK. The rest of them maybe from earlier, but only two of mine. Did you go out this way at all? No. No, they trapped. Hey, hey, stay right there. Got a whole bunch of stuff right there. I don't want to disturb you. I'll come through the door if we can get around that way. Your best way is probably going to be back through those rocks because we can't get any tracks off those rocks. We'll go back around the road where it just came. Thank you. Page 5. Yes. OK, I'll get that in a little bit. OK. Which vehicle are you approaching right now? That was the vehicle that Mr. Murdoch said that he had approached that scene in. Was that a black Suburban to your recollection? Yes. What unit is 23 on Moses? I was going to shoot it off saying, are you behind the house? There's several of us out here. There's a right there. That would be Maggie's body right in front of that shed. Is that correct? That's correct. It's covered up by a sheet at this point. The long dirt driveway right next to the mailbox says 4147. And you'll see all our lights down here at this shed thing. You didn't count through red collar. There you go. OK, I'm on duty. You're not with Mosel. Who's that standing way off in the distance there? That would be Mr. Murdoch. Where did he spend the majority of his time while you were there after your initial interaction with him? From this point on, his general time was spent in that area where he's currently standing. Pretty far away from the scene? That's correct. LA 653. County 470. What was occurring right there? So what was occurring right there? Yeah. So both of those deputies, or Deputy Pruitt would be on the left, and Deputy McDowell would be on the right. Deputy McDowell was taking small pieces of crime scene tape and just setting them by shell casings, I believe. As road patrol officers, we don't generally have those little placards that you'll a lot of times see in crime scene photos. But to prevent somebody from accidentally stepping on them due to it being so dark out there, we tend to take something small like a piece of paper, a piece of crime scene tape, set it next to it just to indicate it a little bit better. Again, part of the job of first responder to sort of protect the scene until the crime scene investigators get there. That's correct. Both these individuals, were you supervising them that night? I was, yes. Looking at this perspective right here, to the left of the screen is Sue's body. To the left right there in the forefront would be Maggie. And in the further back, you can also see where Paul was laying. Was Paul next to or in the kennel area? Yes. I think his brother, he said he was calling somebody. He said what? He said he was calling somebody. OK. I think he was rolling over here. Yeah. I'm sure he was. There's a couple of shell cases right there. Yeah, those will be easy to find. I was just walking a couple of them where I was taking a grab of them. It might be harder to see them from afar. You all familiar with this family? Yes. I wasn't until he told me his name. Last name. I didn't even lay her up. Did you know this family prior to this? I did not. I don't. I don't think there's going to be anything for me. What's that? Did I say Evo? You said for Evo to do? Yeah. Yes. OK. Hey. Who was Evo? Evo would be Deputy McDowell's canine. Watch your step. Huh? There? Yeah. OK. Who was that approaching right now? That would be my immediate supervisor at the time, Lieutenant Lonnie Nettles. The gentleman in the white shirt is the husband of her father to him. That is Paul Murdoch. That's his mother. Paul Murdoch was that guy in the voting accident a while back, if you remember. Yeah. Just then, were you describing the boat wreck? Yes. It had been in local news previously. And it was your understanding that Paul was involved in that? In some way, I had no idea about the actual details of the case to know what his involvement was, honestly. And what's the other thing? Most likely. He did have a firearm whenever I pulled up. It's a shotgun. It's been secured in my vehicle. That's 300 wide out. When you get a chance, can you get a dispatch call? You'll have to give me just a few minutes, but yes, I will. OK. I said to be in the dispatch call. Was that related to the case in any way? I don't believe it was. I don't remember what that phone call ended up being about. As a supervisor, if a lot of us are tied up at one time, they will tend to give me a phone call to let me know that a certain call is pending or something else is going on. Just to help keep the radio traffic free, they'll call me on my cell phone instead. Did your entire squad respond to this particular call, or did somebody? There was one deputy that remained in service. Remained out, did not respond here, but remained on the road. Correct. Yeah. 6-5-3. Who's going to start a log? Who's the most expendable that can start a log? Let's put it that way. This is, can you start a crime scene log, please? A log started. Sled on the way. Let's push. Can we run the tape? 2007, 30. Yes. From that last pole right there to that last pole. Get a piece of paper, start writing names and times. You don't have any kind of paper? Who's that individual right there in the center of the screen? To the right. Detective to the right? Yes. That would be deputy proof. What did you just ask him to do? Start a crime scene log. And tell the jury what that is. Sure. So a crime scene log is established. As soon as additional people start to arrive on scene, we document exactly who comes into the actual crime scene, as well as the exact time that they come into the crime scene. Here, follow that. We can push it from that pole to that pole. Yep. I do see something. That look old or fresh? Old. Old, yes. What are we doing right here with the tape? So I'm securing it to the corner of that part of the shed to run it along to the us shed on the opposite side of that area. We just expanded the crime scene out a little bit further. To protect a larger area? Yes. Yes, sir. Do you need to speak more directly into the mic, or can you increase the volume, Madam Clerk, of that mic? Just a little. Is this one working? Referring to the witness. Oh, sorry. Increase his volume, or? Thank you. First. Yes, sir. I usually don't have a problem being too quiet, but speak up for us if you would, please. All right, so you're securing the crime scene tape. Let's proceed. I'll just hold the light for you. Go away to that place. Just keep our fingers crossed. Yeah, I think we got it. This is 5-3. The respondent unit at the Mosel Road stopped at the road. No one else has come down on the dirt road. Stopped at the road. This is your 787th. How are we doing that? 66 on 95. Coming. What's the other way up here? Come back that way, I guess. Where the house is, I guess. OK. I must go. You referred to the whiskey mic. What's the last one? 18. Affirmative. You referred on this video the term whiskey mic. Can you tell me what that term refers to? Yeah, when we say whiskey mic, we're referring to a white male, a whiskey fox, or a whiskey fox trot, or a white female. And in the context of this particular scene, who's the whiskey mic and who's the whiskey fox or whiskey fox trot? As I was approaching, you could hear me say to dispatch to my radio that there was a whiskey mic, the whiskey mic referring to Paul, whiskey fox referring to Maggie. Do we have anything else? Maggie? Got it. To the very right of the screen, well, strike that. I'll wait. How do you know the times and people's names? Correct. I have a new pair of scissors. I'm using the back side of all the paper. The front side of the paper has names and information on it. I don't know what the numbers are. I'm not sure. It's perfectly fine. Do you not have any promising log sheets? I don't know what you guys are called. I don't know. I will inquire and I'll get back to you. Do you recognize those individuals? Yes. Can you tell us who they are? On the far left would be Detective Tindal. In the forefront toward the center would be Captain Chapman. On the other side of him in the lighter colored shirt with the black vest was Barry McCroy, who worked for Fire Rescue. Did the sheriff respond to this particular incident, to your recollection? Yes, he did. Who was the senior officer actually working the scene at this point in time until Slet arrives? Who was it at this point? That would be Captain Chapman. Captain Chapman? That's correct. Do you want to close that in? Yes. He does not need to walk over there. Let me ask you this. Before you had referred to a brother arriving, is that correct? Yes. Was that a brother? Was he allowed to talk to Alec and go over to Alec? I believe he did. I don't recall. I never actually interacted with him at all. Okay. What was going on right there? There was someone that arrived on scene and wanted to go and speak with Mr. Murdoch. I told him to just wait a minute on allowing him over there so we could determine the best way to allow them to talk, simply because the crime scene was so large and we did not want to contaminate anything that didn't need to be. Okay. To your knowledge, was that individual, whoever it was, allowed to interact with Mr. Murdoch? I believe so. He was. Eventually. People that arrived were allowed to go see Mr. Murdoch? Is that correct? That's correct. He was not in custody at any time. Is that correct? No. I don't have the caller and the caller's brother's name in here because I don't know the names yet, but I can do that. Are you a resident there? Yes. Okay. I don't know where you were at. I just found the person on the page I can find. Female victim, male victim, male caller. And then the other guy, I mean he hasn't came and tried to take you. Then don't have to worry about him. Okay. Just make sure you get the... Here. Is that what you were about to say? Yes. What are you doing on the computer right here? Do you recall? Yes. So on those computers that are mounted in our patrol vehicles, we can see details of the call for service or other calls for service. In this case, I was looking at the information for the incident on Mosel to determine what units had been dispatched, what units arrived, and when they arrived due to Deputy Pruitt trying to establish the crime scene log. And you use the term call for service, which is a place term, but that essentially means responding to any emergency or... Any type of call. Any citizen that would call our dispatch center to request law enforcement assistance or fire rescue assistance, it's called, we refer to it as a call for service. I came on scene at 2226. 2226? Yes. When you say you came on scene at 2226. That's correct. So you don't know military time, can you tell us what that is? That would be 1026 PM. And that's June 7th, 2021? That's correct. And whoever U-21 is with fire rescue, just write U-21, fire rescue U-21. And then... How's the same time as you? He came on scene... Yeah, same time as me, it's fine. Medic 18 at 2227. And it started to rain more at this point. Yeah, it had started raining at this point, yes. 758 on scene 2230, same time as you. 653 on scene at 2239. 2239? Yeah. Those numbers that you're referring to, what do those represent? So the numbers would be the badge numbers of individuals arriving on scene. So you're just recording when various people arrived on the computer? They're recorded in the computer. So when we arrive on scene, we let dispatch know our number and that we're on scene, they log it into the computer, and then we can then put it on our crime scene log. That's all I have as far as times on this goes. Okay. There. There's 758, 7th Central. Copy. When you're clear, I have a call on the jet to go to the suspicious vehicle. Copy. I'm not looking at it. 223 Majestic Oaks, wait in Tideville. 10-4, there's a Cottesville unit that can assist, that'd be great. Pretty sure Majestic Oaks is there jurisdictionally. I'll take care of that. Copy. That individual walking off to the left of the screen, who was that? The one walking away from the screen or the just approached? Walking away. That was Deputy McDowell. All right. And then the center of the screen, who was that? The one that just walked up and is in center screen now would be Captain Krauss. All right. And then next to him, facing the body camera? That would be Captain Chapman. All right. And then to the far right? Detective Tindal. Is there a dog in those kennels to your recollection? There were a couple of dogs. I don't remember the exact number, but I do remember seeing some. I don't remember the exact number, but I do remember seeing some. Copy. You got the watch? We're going to discuss it later and find out. Okay. I was making sure I didn't miss something. Nope. That discussion right there, does that have anything to do with the crime scene or anything like that? No, it was not related at all. What did you just put on your hands then? Those would be latex gloves. And the gloves you put on that you described earlier to the jury, what were those gloves? Those are more tactical gloves. They're not necessarily ideal for handling any kind of evidence, but due to me already being out there next to the shotgun, I did not have any latex gloves on my person, so I used what was available. All right. And why are you putting on latex gloves right now? They were wanting to look under the sheet where Paul was, so just to prevent any kind of contamination of any possible evidence at all. We just always put gloves on. All right. All right. All right. What is that discussion about right there? So the whole purpose for even trying to look up under him was to determine if there was an additional firearm on scene already, possibly under Paul. There was 300 blackout casings found near Maggie. They were trying to determine if there was possibly a 300 blackout rifle under Paul. And while we're all concerned that there may be one under Paul. We just trying to rule it out as a possibility. And what was that possibility then? That he could have shot Maggie. And then did what? Shot himself. So you're looking to see if there's a gun underneath if he had shot himself and then fallen on top of it. That's correct. I haven't asked the dad about the phone, but he did say he came over and checked the pulses. Did you see a phone near Paul when you were up on the scene? Yes, there was a phone laying on top of him near his back pockets of his shorts. I'm going to back it up just a little bit. Is that right down there at the bottom? That's it. I haven't asked the dad about the phone, but he did say he came over and checked the pulses. Beyond that, I don't know what else he made of it. He did have a shotgun with him. I have secured that in my vehicle. Is that right there? Yep. So I've got multiple gunshots out of that window too. Do we see a shell? At least three. To the left of the screen, what does that appear to be? There's some dog crates over there on top of one of the dog crates. It's actually a dead chicken. Say that again, I'm sorry? A dead chicken. On the far left-hand side of the screen. It's difficult to see, but right here on top of that small dog crate, what appeared to be a dead chicken. That's it. I don't know what else he made of it. I don't know what else he made of it. Is that the light that your light's on right there? I don't know what else he made of it. Just so you know, I've got at least five holes in the window in the back of that shed where rounds are exiting out the back that way. It is currently in my vehicle. Where's the light? Let me stand for a moment. I'll stand for a moment. We may proceed. I'll stand for a moment. I'll stand for a moment. I'll stand for a moment. I'll stand for a moment. I'll stand for a moment. We cut the video off after playing sort of the relevant parts, but what did you do for the remainder of the scene as the evening continued? So the remaining part of my role would have just been making sure the crime scene stayed secure, people stayed out of where they weren't supposed to be. Investigators were handling the remainder of the investigation. Did eventually anyone from the SLED, the state law enforcement division, show up? They did. I don't believe that would have been captured on my body camera, but they did, yes. At some point, did you like to turn your body camera off? I did. I cleared it with my supervisor, Captain Kraus, to ensure that I would not be needed for any additional investigative purposes, talking to Mr. Murdaugh or handling any additional evidence. Once that was okayed, I turned it off. So that was consistent with standard police procedures and practices and when to turn the body camera off? That's correct. You just didn't decide to do it willy-nilly or anything? That's correct. At what point, just roughly, do you remember, did you clear the scene or leave the scene? I don't think I left the scene until several hours later. Were you still there when the SLED crime scene arrived? Yes. Did you remain the entire time they were there, or did you leave at some point? I would have left prior to the end of my shift. I couldn't tell you the exact time that it was, but there were multiple units, including SLED and Culleton County investigators, still on scene when I left. That's all the questions after this witness, Your Honor. Cross-examination. Your Honor, I'm just going to take a minute to set up some of the audio visual stuff. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll take a break at this time. Please go to the jury room. Please do not discuss the case. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. around the dog pen is correct. That's what the period is. Okay. And let's go to that part. Technology don't work. Okay. Okay. Yes. I have one dog. You don't keep in a pen. No, he stays in the house. Okay. But if you had hunting dogs and you had this line of you, how many pens do you think there were? I honestly couldn't tell you. There's a lot. Eight, nine, ten? Sure. And are you familiar with the concept of washing a pen out after a dog defecates in the pen? I've never personally done it, but I'm sure that's what you would do to clean out a pen. Okay. And in the pen, I mean, there's water inside the pens and outside the pens, correct? That's what it looks like. Okay. Go ahead. The water appears to be outside the pen on the costume. Go ahead. I would object. I think that the video needs to be stopped for counsel to ask this question and for the limits to respond. You're posing a question while playing a video or making a statement while playing a video. Sorry. The technology again is beyond my experience. Okay. So again, this shows the same area. It shows water on the concrete outside these dog pens, correct? Yes. Okay. Go to the next one, please. So again, this shows actually the light shining and you see a couple dogs. So those pens are occupied by dogs. There's water outside the pen and inside the pen as if somebody attempted to wash something out of the pen, correct? There is water both inside and outside of the pen, yes. We have one more. Again, I apologize, Your Honor, but the technology is more complicated than expected. So let's proceed on, let's see if I can clarify a couple of matters. Let's talk about this shotgun. You, this is the shotgun that Mr. Murdoch was carrying or had leaning up against the car when he got there, is that correct? It was leaning up against that vehicle, yes. And according to what you testified to just a moment ago, these are the shells, the chain of custody on the shotgun and the shell, they went together? Whenever I released the shotgun to the sled agent who took possession of it, I was unaware of any shells that may have been inside of it at the time that it was handed over. That was what was discovered inside the gun is my understanding. Where is that chain of evidence documented? Okay, would you publish this to the jury, please? You would like me to read it? Yes, please. The Camo Benelli Super Black Eagle III 12 gauge shotgun, serial number U573210E17, one unfired shot shell, 12 gauge Federal, one unfired shot shell, Winchester 16 gauge. Okay, so there's a 12 gauge shell and a 16 gauge shell. Yes. 12 gauge shotgun. Yes. This may be way beyond your experience, but can you fire a 16 gauge shotgun shell from a 12 gauge shotgun? I wouldn't recommend trying it. You wouldn't recommend what? I would not recommend trying it. I don't know that it would actually work or not. Could it result in damage to the person trying to fire the shotgun? More than likely. He's already said he doesn't have an answer to that. Objections unruled. So you would not really, you can actually harm yourself if you pull off, if you pull the trigger on a 16 gauge and a 12 gauge shotgun? I've never tried it nor seen it tried, so I don't know. And the reason you don't do that is because you could have personal harm from doing it, right? It's possible. So this shotgun, according to the chain of evidence you just read, had a 16 gauge and a 12 gauge in it? Correct. And was leaning up against the car? It was, the shotgun was. Now, I'm sort of interested as to, I'm sort of interested as to why, well, let me just cut the chase on this. There's discussions on this tape that there was a theory that Paul had shot his mother and then shot himself. Is that correct? Out on the scene? Yes. Because she had been shot multiple times and he had been shot with a shotgun, at least one of the shots, we all believe was upward. That's why his brains were all over the ceiling. That part, I don't know. I wasn't involved in that part. At the scene. I did not discuss anything being shot upward. I don't recall saying that. Did you hear discussions to that of your fellow officers? Of a shot being fired upward? That's what it looked like they were saying, yes. Okay. And further, I think in front of you, one of the officers saying that brains are on the ceiling, there's blood all over the place, correct? I don't recall them saying brain was upward. I don't recall. Okay. And further, you, as you're discussing this with them, indicate, let me make sure I get this correct. You indicate there are multiple, or someone indicates to you there are multiple blackout rounds around Maggie's body in the vicinity, correct? Not rounds, but shell casings. Sorry, shell casings. Now, let me ask you this. When you got there, didn't the fire chief and the fire department arrive before you did? No, sir. I was first on scene. Okay. Did they arrive while you were there? One of the fire rescue workers, I believe it was Barry McCoy. And when you got there, we hear unidentified person, and in your notes you indicate it was the fire chief, I believe, that indicated to you, pointed out to you tire tracks, and you went over and looked at those tire tracks, and there were multiple tire tracks coming and going, correct? I don't know that someone indicated them to me. I believe I just saw them. Okay. And what did you do to preserve those? The tire tracks? Nothing. And you certainly are not an expert in tire tracks? I'm not. So you couldn't tell whether it was multiple vehicles or one vehicle? No. And it may have been multiple vehicles? May have been. Did you take pictures of the tracks? I did not take any pictures of the scene. Did you instruct anyone to take pictures of the tracks? No, sir, that's not my job. When Sled arrived, did you tell them about the tracks? No, sir, not my job. Do you regret not doing that? It's not part of my job description. But what's your job to even tell them there were multiple tire tracks? If it had come up, if I had been asked, yes. And in addition to that, since they were not secured in any way, multiple vehicles, law enforcement vehicles and others drove over those tracks. That's possible. I wasn't over there the whole time to know what kind of vehicles were driving in the area. Well, by the time Sled got there, did you – strike that – you never took Sled over and pointed out tire tracks? Not to my recollection, I did not. Was there somebody there with your department that should have done that? I have no idea what they do with their job descriptions as far as what they point out to additional investigators. Did somebody from Fire and Rescue point out footprints? I believe on my body camera there is a Fire Rescue individual pointing out some footprints. Okay. Did you take pictures of those? I did not. Did you tell Sled about them? I did not. So nobody attempted to determine whether those were Maggie's footprints, Paul's footprints, or at least that night there was no effort by you or your department to preserve those? By me, no. I cannot speak for everyone else. Okay. And let me ask you this. How about go to 4439, please? And let's watch 10 – at least 10, if not 15 seconds of that. Okay. Okay. Okay. You can go to page 17, line 10. Your Honor, out of Jack, they're putting a transcript that's not in – No, no, no, no. We're going to play the video. It's up on the screen. It's up on the screen, Your Honor. Out of Jack. I apologize. Can you take it down, please? We haven't prepared a transcript. We can just sync with the video. Well, I object to that. Your Honor, I object. This transcript has not been provided. There's no need for a transcript. The officer is here. You can play the video and he can comment on it. I have a transcript being offered. Not offered, no. I'm using it to direct the audio and video plan to the court. Well, you have questions for the witness, questions for the I.T. guy. You're just reading, ready to proceed. I understand. We're waiting for you. Okay. I'm ready. What was it? Time 17. I'm going to put the button on that. Rather than having to play this, let me just cut to the chase. It's taking too much time. I'm not publishing. I'm asking. I object. I haven't heard a question yet. Okay. Let me further ask you. You asked Mr. Murdoch, we heard this on the tape, he talked about the tire tracks coming and going and he told you those weren't his tire tracks, correct? He did say that they were not. And further, he indicated to you, Mr. Murdoch, that he felt this was related to the boat case. You indicated you knew about the boat case. You read about the boat case. That's correct. And in the boat case, Paul had been charged with three counts of felony BUI, killing a young girl and wounding two others, correct? I don't know much details about that case. I really don't. But Mr. Murdoch indicated to you that the threats made against Paul. He did. And that he even got in a fight once about it. I believe he said punched. Punched, okay. And so on the scene, he believed that Paul's death was connected to someone angry about the boat case, correct? I'll check to that, Your Honor, as to what he believed, asking to witness what another person believed. Thank you. On the scene, Mr. Murdoch indicated to you he thought the death of his son was related to his son's involvement in the death of a young lady and the injury of two others in the boat case, correct? It appeared that that's what he was getting at, yes. And that's on the tape. Now, let's talk a little bit about the preservation of the crime scene. What did you do other than put yellow tape up to preserve the crime scene? That is about the extent of my job is to put up the tape and make sure that people that don't need to cross it don't cross it. And I noticed that there were officers walking around putting little pieces of tape near shell casings. There was one officer doing that, yes. And in the process of doing that, I didn't see any lights other than maybe a flashlight. Did you all put up any sort of high-intensity lights so people could make sure they weren't stepping on something in the dark? At that point, there was no additional lighting that had been put up, no. But you and your officers were walking through that entire area, is that correct? We were walking in the area, yes. Okay, and did you actually, I mean the feed room, and let me, maybe this is the best way to do this. I'll put the towel, picture for you. I'd like to use the helmet. Okay. I have two photographs. I'm going to use the Elmo in just a moment to show this witness. I'm going to offer these as evidence without objection by the state, as I understand it. Once they're marked, I have no objection. They can be marked. What would the numbers be for the defense? Defense one and two are admitted without objection. So, thank you. I'm going to first show you the picture. Let's see if you can identify it, please. That would be a picture of Paul. And the second one, which would be exhibit number two. Picture of Maggie. When you say picture of Paul and picture of Maggie, these are crime scene photos, correct? They appear to be, yes. Is this what you saw that night? Yes. Both of these pictures? Yes. So, I'm going to ask you to pick what you saw that night. I'm going to go with one. Okay. So, as you look at this, I want to make sure I understand. One of Paul's feet is still inside. This is the feed room behind him, correct? Yes. And this is his head, lots of blood, and this would be a part of his brain lying next to him, correct? I don't know if that's part of his brain or not. All right, so it's fair to say you didn't know that that was part of the brain. When you first saw him, you didn't know that his injuries were catastrophic and he was dead. Or did you? It was very clear that it was catastrophic. Okay. Now, when you came upon the scene, clearly this feed room was part of the crime scene, correct? Yes. Now, you're taught to keep the crime scene pristine, correct? As pristine as possible, yes. There was no reason for you to go in there, was there? Me at the time, no. Was there any reason for the police to go in there before the slave crime folks showed up? Was there any reason for you all to go in there? There was no reason for me to go in there? I cannot speak if there was a reason for another officer to have gone in there. Well, let me ask you this. Did you all have any sort of crime scene expert at with you that night, someone that processes crime scenes? Investigators do process crime scenes. Do you remember going in that feed room? I don't remember if I did specifically or not. But you shouldn't have if you did, correct? It's not to say that I shouldn't have. If there was something that needed to be done in there, then yes. I guess what I'm getting at is, I think one of the, and you would agree with me, one of the cardinal rules of a crime scene is keep it pristine. Don't walk over things. Try to preserve tire tracks. Get pictures of them. Footprints. All those sorts of things. Was somebody on with the officers with you, were you in charge of the scene? I was in charge of the deputies that were under my immediate supervision until someone higher than me arrived on scene. And were those deputies directed by you or anyone to do something to preserve the tire tracks? Pictures? Recording them off? Cover them up? I did not give anyone that instruction, no. So you didn't do that. In terms of where Paul was laying, was anybody instructed, you know, put a cordon around him. There's no reason to go into the thief room. There's no reason to do anything intrusive until they sled crime scene processes. They're on the way at this point, right? I believe they were, yes. And so if, okay, so let's put the other one up. And identify this or we'll go to you. That's Maggie Myrtle. I didn't, which is where the officer was but they knew about it and they may be approached very briefly. you you you And can you identify this for the jury that picture It's Maggie Murda. That's correct. And by the way, when you saw her from, I mean, the parents that she was deceased, do you believe, I mean, but you, have you ever seen a dead body before? I have seen multiple, yes. Many, right? Yes. So you're sort of an expert in this area, who's dead, who's not, who ought to get EMS there to check them out, correct? Do you make that call often? Yes. I would understand, obviously, Alex Murdaugh is concerned that they might be alive, that maybe, maybe, I mean, you're not saying that he shouldn't be concerned if somebody checked out both Maggie and Paul to make sure, make sure they were dead, right? He was very concerned about that, yes. Okay. Now, as to Maggie Murdaugh, we see these numbers, did y'all do these numbers, or were they done after y'all were there? I don't know when those numbers were done. They were not placed by myself. Or your team. I can't say that for certain. We see that in the video, they're putting down yellow tape, they're not putting these down, correct? That's correct. Now, you also, according to the video we saw, a number of your officers are walking around marking where cartridges are, right? They were. Did they pick any of them up? No, not to my knowledge. Later on we see them talking to you and others on the video where they're saying these rounds came from a blackout, they were blackout rounds. Blackout. 300 blackout, yes, sir. Right. I mean, did they get down on their hands and knees and look, or, I mean, did they pick them up? You would have to ask them, I don't know what they did to know that they were 300 blackout rounds. Well, who would, who would, who would those officers that were walking around her without a light on, perhaps stepping on, that's correct. Who were those officers? Deputy McDowell and Deputy Pruitt were both in that area. Were they doing that pursuant to your instruction? They were not specifically instructed to do it, they just took the initiative to do it. Okay, I don't know, I want to play... I want to play... You ready? Do I have my turn now? Okay. Well, the best over there. Okay, so this is your officer is putting a sheet on Paul's body? Not putting a sheet on, the sheet was already there. Already there, okay, continue. The more sheets you put on, the more you're going to see them. Who's that standing inside the feed room? Just inside that doorway was Deputy McDowell. You're watching him do it, right? That's correct. Should he have done that? Stand where he's standing? Standing inside the feed room. It's part of the crime scene, we're all standing inside the crime scene. Inside what? The crime scene, we are all standing in the same crime scene. I understand the same crime scene, but clearly you believed, based on discussion and everyone in your unit believed, that the fatal shot was made where he was basically standing, correct, in that area. Where we are all standing? Yes. Yes, sir. Is that procedure to walk around on top of an area where shots have been fired? And I think even in this they're talking about tissue or brain matter laying there. I mean, aren't you supposed to, you don't put anything on your feet? There's not a question in that statement. Let's sustain him, let's pose questions. Did you in any way have your men or women put protective gear on their feet? I saw you put gloves on, but did they put anything to insulate themselves from contaminating the scene? On their feet, no. In many instances, departments around the country have people dressed in a gown to keep their DNA, their hair from contaminating the scene. Did you do that? We do not on road patrol with Gallatin County as standard practice, no. You do not do that? Not as standard practice, no. Have you ever done that? I have not. Have you ever had something covering your feet when you're walking on a crime scene? I couldn't tell you that for sure. Now, if we later on find, and did you notice bloody footprints, did you notice bloody footprints inside the feed room? I don't remember seeing any. Sorry? I don't remember seeing any bloody footprints. If there were bloody footprints in the feed room, could they have been created by you or your men? They could have been created by anyone walking in that area, sure. And you're walking in there, or your men are walking in there, correct? Correct. And you think that's standard operating procedure? Well, you do your best not to contaminate anything. And this is your best? What you're looking at right now is standard procedure. To walk in an area where there's blood, where there's brain matter, where there's and I believe there's wadding laying on the floor. I don't recall. But you would agree with me that you have these procedures so that you don't contaminate the crime scene, so that you don't destroy evidence, like those tire tracks, or those footprints, or leave your DNA, or in some way alter the scene so that if I mean you would agree with me, so that, let me finish the question, so that if there is exculpatory or inculpatory evidence that would help you find the perpetrator and prosecutor, or evidence that would clear somebody, that was destroyed. Some of that was destroyed that night. Because you, your department, and maybe even SWED, didn't preserve that evidence. Isn't that correct? I'm not sure if I fully understand your question. The question is this, if you are exfoliating your standing, your men are standing in the spot, and there was evidence there, or the tire tracks that weren't preserved, or the footprints that weren't preserved, that evidence could either incriminate somebody, or exculpate somebody, could, correct? Could, yes. That's why you don't do this, right? That's why you don't contaminate the evidence, correct? We put it around the whole area. Did you put it so that folks couldn't drive in and out? They were not to go past where my vehicle was parked. I believe that was the extent of the illotaping. But between your vehicle and the entrance, there was, none of those tire tracks were preserved? Entrance of? The property. If somebody had driven into the property. You mean from the main road of Mozilla? From the main road. All the vehicles were coming in on that driveway. Right. So if somebody had come in and left, who committed the murders, whatever tire tracks that were left were obliterated by your men. Is that right? Yes, as possible. Were you there with the coroner, Ryan? Given my extent of the time there, I would assume so, but I don't remember specifically. Do you remember seeing the coroner? The coroner. I may have, I don't remember specifically. Apparently, according to the body cam, you didn't talk to him. Not on my body cam room, but it could have been after the body cam was turned off. I don't know. Why was it turned off? Why was the body cam turned off? Once my job, my specific job of doing any primary investigation after my initial arrival is completed and I'm not going to be doing anything further to investigate, it's no longer needed. Thank you, Your Honor. May I please record? You were asked a series of questions about contaminating evidence. Are you aware that any evidence was contaminated in this case? I'm not. Did you engage in everything you could to avoid contaminating evidence? Yes. Did you in fact instruct your deputies, set up a crime scene, and instruct them to avoid areas where evidence might be contaminated? We did everything we possibly could to avoid contaminating evidence. Your officers all have basic training in trying to avoid contamination of evidence? Yes. Are you also, though, as first responders, in a fluid situation, doing the best you can to assess what's going on? Correct. It's not your job to do the actual crime scene investigation work, is that correct? Not at all. You were asked about whether or not you had any meetings with prosecutors. Is it common for law enforcement witnesses or anyone to meet with prosecutors prior to a trial? Very common. Did anybody ask you to do anything but express your accurate, honest opinions and observations about what you observed at this scene? No. You were asked about this particular shotgun right here. This 12-gauge shotgun. This is the shotgun that Alan Murdock had when you arrived at the scene, is that correct? That's correct. You were asked about the shells right here, is that correct? That's correct. Did you unload this weapon? I did not. Was it unloaded by somebody else after you turned it over to them? Yes. You asked a little bit about the 300 blackout casings or cases that were at the scene, is that correct? That's correct. Just real quick, explain to the jury what a casing or a case is, please. A casing would be what would be left after the projectile has been fired through a weapon. After it had been fired. The shell that comes out of the gun and lands on the ground, here's the victim, is that correct? That's correct. So it's the remnants of a fire ground, is that right? That's correct. There were multiple ones of those blackouts surrounding Maggie, is that correct? That is correct. You were asked a lot about tire tracks and you just happened to notice those over behind the defense vehicle, is that correct? That's correct. And we had a still image put into evidence, exhibit number five, this is it right here, which is the still image, is that right? Yes. And the still image doesn't reflect as good as what the video does, is that right? The video shows it much better. Were these like tracks in the dirt or were these just impressions in the grass, in the dewy grass? They appeared to be impressions on the dewy grass. They weren't like tracks in the dirt that you saw, correct? No. I'm going to go back to the video. I'm playing it at approximately 25 minutes and 11 seconds. See, from earlier, but only two of them. Did you go out this way at all? No. No, they trapped. We're coming back. Let's go over to that corner of the building. I'm almost there, let me see what we have first, whether or not we'll handle that part or not. I see quite a few tire tracks in here. Were any of these you going in and out? No, I came in here and I left one time and I came back. Okay. The rest of them, maybe from earlier, but only two were mine. Did you go out this way? So the images that we just saw, those were the dewy impressions on the grass that you were just talking about, is that correct? That's correct. And the defendant said two of them were mine and the rest of them may have been from earlier, is that correct? Yes. You were asked a little bit about the boat case. Did you have any detailed knowledge or understanding of the boat case when you arrived at the scene? No. You just knew very generally that there were some boat cases, is that right? Yes, it had been in the news. Did you even realize that the boat case was in the news? No. Did you even realize that the boat case was in the news? No. Did you even realize that the boat case was in the news? Yes. It had been in the news. Did you even realize that this was that Paul Murdock when you arrived on the scene? Not until he had brought up the boat incident. And who brought up the boat incident? Mr. Murdock did. And within a few minutes of you arriving, he's the one that brought up the boat incident, is that correct? He did. And he offered that right out of the gate as a possible explanation for what happened here, is that right? Yes. Nothing further, Your Honor. Anything further? Did you find it reasonable for him to say that his son who had been involved in this incident, who had been threatened on numerous occasions, been punched, he told you he had been punched, right? He did. Okay. That was a possible explanation, not impossible for somebody killing Paul. You didn't bite back on him, did you? No. And it was in his mind apparently the only reasonable explanation that occurred, right? I don't know what was in his mind. Well, I mean, that's what he told you. That's what he believed. That was the statement that he made, yes. Okay. And just one other follow-up question. You were asked if there was any evidence, the Dewey tire tracks, this was at 10 o'clock at night, was there dew on the ground already? It was pretty humid out. There was a lot of dew. It was humid. Yeah. It wasn't like in the morning. This was not morning time. So, but, and are you telling me no one could have looked, no expert could have looked and said, you know, that's a suburban, that's a pickup truck, that's, no one could do that? I'm not going to pretend to know what an expert in that kind of stuff can and can't do. But you were, you're not an expert, did you believe those tire tracks would last until Sled got there? Yes, it appeared that they probably would. Did you point them out to Sled? Did I do what? Did you point them out to Sled? I did not. Let me step down. Call your next witness. Thank you, Your Honor. The state calls Corporal McDowell. Do you solemnly swear or affirm that the testimony you give to the court in this trial shall be the truth so help you God? I do. Thank you. If you'll have a seat and adjust that microphone. Make sure you speak into that microphone. State your name and spell your last name, please. My name is Chad McDowell. The last name is spelled M-C-D-O-W-E-L-L. Corporal McDowell, how are you doing today? Good. Tell the jury where you work, please. I work for College and County Sheriff's Office as a homicide and jury patrol at the K9 Handler. Okay, and can you just give us a quick background of who you are, where you grew up, and how you ended up in your career in law enforcement? Sure. I grew up in Colleton County. I went to Colleton County High School. I went to college at Tri-County Technical College where I studied criminal justice. Once I reached age, I came home, was hired by Colleton County Sheriff's Office, left for a couple years to go work for Jasper County, then came back to Colleton. I've been assigned to road patrol at Colleton. And what year did you first start working for Colleton County Sheriff's Department or began your law enforcement career? 2016. And what's your current, you're a corporal now, is that correct? Yes, sir. And what is your current assignment? I'm still assigned to road patrol. I'm a K9 handler. You say K9. Explain to the jury what that is. So I have a K9 that is assigned to me. We respond to certain calls for, if we're requested by another deputy for narcotics searches, searches for suspects, things of that matter. K9 is a dog, correct? That's correct. What's your dog's name? Evo. What kind of dog is Evo? He's a Belgian Malamor. Malamor? Yep. Is that kind of like a German Shepherd? Kind of. Short haired, pointy ears. Is Evo typically with you when you're out on patrol? Yes, sir. Was Evo with you the night of June 7th, 2021? Yes, sir. Were you a corporal then at that time? Yes, sir. I was a deputy. And who was on the squad that you were on? Sergeant Daniel Green, Corporal Elise Janicki, myself, and Deputy Cody Perrut. So who was your immediate supervisor? It would have been Corporal Janicki. And then above that is? Sergeant Green. And then above that? Lieutenant Edels. And then above that? Captain Krauss. What shift were you working the night of June 7th, 2021? Yes, sir, I was. And that was in Colleton County? Yes, sir. And what shift were you working that night? Night shift. Did you ultimately respond to a call for service at 4147 Moselle Road? Yes, sir. And you actually went there? I did. And did you come to the incident location at the kennels at that property at 4147 Moselle Road? I did. Is that in Colleton County? It is. Were you, when you arrived, what other first responders were on scene to your recollection? Sergeant Green was there. There was one other fire rescue personnel vehicle in there. I believe the rest were staged, the best I can remember. When I say staged, I mean at the head of the driveway. They may have, there may have been a couple of other apparatuses on scene. And which, do you recall which driveway you entered? Did you enter the driveway near the kennels? Yes, sir. It was the same driveway everyone else entered. So you were parked behind Sergeant Green's? Yes, sir. What did you do after that, after you got out of your vehicle? What did you do? I approached the crime scene. I was trying to make my way to Sergeant Green to see what he needed me to do. I made my way through the crime scene as carefully as I could. I approached Sergeant Green. I saw that he was interviewing the only person on scene. So I went back to my vehicle. And did you see who he was interviewing? Mr. Murdoch, yes, sir. Do you see him in the courtroom here today? Yes, sir. Can you point him out? Yes, sir. He's in the middle, native blue suit. Can the director reflect these to identify the defendant? I'm going to show you what's been marked as Exhibit 6 to your testimony. No objection. This is a desk, but I want you to take a look at it and see if you recognize this desk. Yes, sir, I do. And what is on this desk? It would be body cam footage from my body cam that I wore. And how do you know that this is that body cam footage? It has my initials on it. You put your initials on it, is that correct? Yes, sir. If I could get input, please. Let me ask you this. When you got this call for service, were you currently on another call for service or were you just out on patrol? No, sir, I was just out on patrol. Once you got that call for service, what did you do? Did you activate your lights and sirens? I activated lights and sirens and responded to the incident location. And once you do that, do you make all haste to get to that incident location as fast, but also as reasonably safe as you can? Yes, sir. Is that standard operating procedure? Yes, sir. The first 10 minutes of this body cam are essentially you driving to the scene, is that correct, roughly? Yes, sir. I'm going to fast forward to closer in time when you arrive. I heard proceed to the route. What was that? I had a GPS activated on my phone. Just like most people use, is that right? Yes, sir. Take a slight left turn. In a quarter mile, arrive at 4147 Hosell Road. 718 South Sound, Liza. Are these the kennels that you saw when you arrived at the property? Yes, sir. And to the right is sort of the shed or the hanger, is that correct? That's correct. Let me ask you this. You're obviously serving as a road patrol officer, is that correct? Yes, sir. What is your job as a road patrol officer, as a first responder, when you come upon a scene like this? What is your particular role as you arrive at something like this? We go on scene, we secure the scene, make sure there's no active threat for other arriving first responders. We'll preserve the scene to the best of our ability and then turn the scene over to arriving detectives. When you arrive at a scene like this, are you constantly not only paying attention for any threat or anything like that, but also making sure that you don't disturb or any sort of evidence that may be at the scene? Yes, sir. Is that part of your general training and standard operating procedure? It is. You also have to couple that, though, with the duties of a first responder, which is to get to that scene, to secure it, make sure there's no active threats, and get it under control, is that correct? That's correct. So the duties of a first responder have both of those sort of balancing together, is that right? Yes, sir. Are you constantly always looking around for evidence, not only to identify it, but also to assure that you don't disturb anything? Is that your general? Judge, you're out of weeding. Thank you, Your Honor. What is your general training as a road officer as it relates to coming upon a scene and looking for evidence? Our number one duty would be safety. Number two, we're looking for evidence so as not to disturb it. Thank you. Right there to the right, what is that to the right of the screen? It could be Miss Murdoch's body. Sergeant Grant Stader Murdoch. Who are those individuals right there? Sergeant Green and Mr. Murdoch. How you doing? What did the defendant say to you right there? He said, how are you doing? Did you know him? No, sir. How you doing? That's what he said? Yes, sir. What's their birth date? 9-15-68. What's your son's first name? Paul. Paul Terry Murdoch. What's his birth date? 4. What are you doing? He's asking if we don't have to disturb anything, not to. What were you asking Fire and Rescue to do at that point? Just to try to preserve it the best they could. But what were you specifically asking them not to do? Cover the bodies if they didn't have to. What was their response, though? I couldn't make it out. I believe he said we're covering them for family responding. I couldn't make it out. He's asking if we don't have to disturb anything, not to. We've got the plan on the way. Do you recall now? Again, it sounds like he says we're going to cover them up because of the family being here. Because of the family being here? That's what it sounds like. All right. Yes, I agree. Hey, Cody, I need a piece of that tape whenever you get done. What did you just ask Cody for? A piece of tape, a piece of crime scene tape. All right. And who was Cody? Deputy Pruitt. He was the one that you see there with the yellow crime scene tape. And why did you ask Deputy Pruitt for some crime scene tape? I had observed a shell casing on the ground I wanted to mark it so that it didn't become disturbed. General Dutton, as an officer, you observed something and you asked for some tape to mark it. Is that correct? Yes, sir. And that's what you were previously describing your role is. Is that correct? Yes, sir. Yeah. If y'all don't mind, just mark them. Do what? Okay. They're got a casing right here, so watch your step. The case that you saw, did you recognize what kind of ammunition it was? Yes, sir. What kind of ammunition was it? 300 blackout casing. And how could you tell it was a 300 blackout casing? Just my own personal experience. I own a 300 blackout and I recognize it. You recognize the case from your own experience? Yes, sir. All right. 300 blackout. Did you observe any dogs in the kennels? I did. Do you remember how many or where they were? I do not remember. More than one dog there? I don't remember. They said they had several casings by her body, but this one will be a little bit harder to find later, so I want to mark it real fast. When you marked that casing, were you careful not to disturb its location where you found it? Yes, sir. I have seen many shell casings and only one. Okay. Sorry to do that to everyone. What was that loud noise? It was just my windshield wipers. Why was it making that noise? Because they had removed all the moisture, I guess. I don't see anybody. I see a couple more. I'm trying to figure out whether it's 300 blackout. I'm trying to figure out why there are so many shell casings, but only one gunshot went to the back of each head. I don't know. Not my job to figure that out. I'm just curious. I only saw one more casing, but just in case I see more. Daniel put his car in there. So, no. This is, I'll tell you about this in a minute. There's one there. There's blood over here. You looking at shell casings? 300 blackout. Is that your job to be doing a crime scene collection for this case or are you just doing that to assist those who will do that that will arrive at a later time? No, sir. I don't collect anything. I'm just marking it so that they're not disturbed. Probably. Yeah, those will be easy to find. I was just marking a couple that were in the gravel. It might be harder to see at some point. You all familiar with this family? Yeah. I'll fill you in later. I don't. I was thinking there was going to be anything for me anybody to do here. What did you just say right there? I don't think there's going to be anything for me in either case. I just want to make sure that I've got something to say. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know. What did you just say right there? I don't think there's going to be anything for me and Evo to do here. What did you mean by that? There was no article search that needed to be conducted right then and there. Putting Evo on the ground could have caused more of a disturbance than just leaving him up. You said for Evo to do? Yeah, for me and Evo. Please watch your door. Hey, watch your step. Okay. It's going to be a retaliation from family. Okay. I'm going to now show you a portion of what's been previously admitted to evidence as Exhibit 1. And for the record, I'm starting at 4227. Who's that to the right of the screen right there? That would be me. All right. And what are you about to do? Step inside and assist CID with lifting that sheet. All right. And were you asked to do that? Yes, sir. And who asked you to do that? Captain Chapman. All right. And where's Captain Chapman in this image? In the middle. And has he had senior officer to you? At that time. Okay. And I noticed before you moved, what did you do? Turned my light on. And why did you turn on your light? So that I could plainly see what was underneath me, where I was going. Did you disturb any evidence or anything as you started to go into the feed room? No, sir. Were you careful to avoid doing that? Yes, sir. Did you kick any shell casings or waddings or anything like that when you went into the feed room? No, sir. Did you step on any bloody footprints when you went into the feed room? No, sir. If you had seen something like that before you stepped in there, what would you have done? I would have stopped and notified the detective. Fire rescue might have some more sheets to be sealed. Do you recall what if anything was laying on Paul's rear end? His cell phone or a cell phone. Did you see that in this image right here? I haven't asked the dad about the phone, but dad did say he came over and checked the pulses. Beyond that I don't know what he was thinking. He did have a shot in the back and secured that immediately. Did you kind of jump out of the feed room just then? Yes, sir. Did you turn on your light before you did so? I believe so. Watch it again. Did you jump out when you left the feed room? Yes, sir. And why did you jump out like that? Trying not to disturb the body. It was easier to leap out than to try to step. Did you enter the feed room at any point after that to your recollection? Not to my recollection. I'm going to show you what's been marked as Defense Exhibit Number 1 and see if you recognize this particular image. Does that appear to be how you found Paul when you arrived at the scene? Yes, sir. Were his hands underneath him in that fashion when you arrived at the scene? I believe that's the State's Exhibit 7 without objection. I'm going to show you what's been marked as Exhibit 7 and see if you recognize that image. Yes, sir. And what is that? It's a still image of video of my body on camera. Is that a still image of when the defendant said, how you doing when you walked up? I'm not the first one to see this on camera. Please support your Honor. So when you got to the scene, who was your supervisor? Can you repeat that question? I couldn't hear you. I'm sorry. I'll speak a little bit louder. When you got to the scene, who was your supervisor? Sergeant Green. Sergeant Green. And I believe Sergeant Green was instructing you all to put some yellow tape up. You did some of that? Yes, sir. You didn't do any of that? Definitely approve it, yes, but I didn't know. What was, Sergeant Green, what was his instructions to you? What were you there to do? Number 1, let me withdraw that question. Were you there to apprehend somebody? Not at the time, sir. I was just there to assist where needed. Assist doing what? Whatever was needed of me. Were you all attempting to determine what happened? We there as initial responders were there to secure the scene. Okay, secure the scene. And secure the scene for further processing by SWAV? By our investigators, I learned later on that SLED was responding as well. So let me, by way of example, you went down to where Paul's body was. It was covered with a sheet. You see that on the video. Correct? Not when I initially responded, but yes, sir. No, no, but the video we just saw? Yes, sir. And why were you all, I mean, what was the, was there a purpose of going down there and pulling the sheet back, looking around? I believe they were looking for another weapon. What kind of weapon? I believe they were looking for a.300 blackout. But I mean we saw in the picture, you looked at Paul's body, there's no.300 blackout laying next to him? Correct? No, sir. I'm correct. Yes, you are correct. No, there was no.300 blackout laying beside him. Okay, so you say you're down there looking for another weapon. Where were you looking for another weapon? I wasn't, sir. I was assisting lifting the sheet for detectives. And you can see you stepped into the feed room. Yes, sir. And based on the way Paul was laying, and of course you did have a flashlight and you were looking dry not to step on anything. Did you have anything insulate your feet, and in some jurisdictions they have little baggy things to put over their feet to make sure they don't contaminate the scene. Did you have those on? No, sir. And did you, when you stepped in, you got a flashlight, what you were looking at with the visible eye, you were determining you weren't disturbing the scene, correct? That's correct. You made an effort not to. Yes, sir. You don't know whether you did it or you didn't. To my knowledge I did not. But you can't say that you didn't. To your knowledge. Can you repeat that? To your knowledge you didn't. To my knowledge I did not disturb anything. Okay, but you would concede there's microscopic evidence sometimes of crime scenes, correct? Yes, sir, that's possible. And you didn't have a microscope? No, sir. But like SLED's crime team would look very closely, would they not? They would not? I mean as far as I could tell you were looking basically three or four feet away from the floor, right? Yes, sir. Okay. So what you can see with the naked eye at night with a flashlight from three or four feet is what you base your opinion you didn't disturb anything. That's correct. Now, and you don't know why they were looking for another weapon, but you don't know what other weapon, you don't know where that weapon might have been, and again multiple deputies had seen Paul Blotty before he was covered with a sheet, right? Myself, Sergeant Green did. Okay. In your presence, any of the other officers with you there that night, did any of them discuss this as a possible murder suicide? Murder suicide? It's possible, not to my recollection. Now when you were going out and we saw you mark a shell casing, was that in the grass or on the dirt road? I believe the first one was in the gravel. In the gravel, I'm sorry? Yes, sir. Okay. But you found others, right? Yes, sir. And to do that you had to walk around in the grass? Yes, sir. And again, you've got a flashlight and you're looking and you don't know what was in the grass that you may have disturbed around those shell casings? No, sir. You don't know? No, sir. You may have disturbed something? It's possible. And I guess what I'm trying to ask is why then were you trying to look for shell casings? Why couldn't you wait until the next morning? Why was this urgency? I mean, was somebody getting away or, I don't quite understand why? I can't answer that. I didn't know if somebody was getting away or not. Did somebody instruct you to go find shell casings? No, sir. You just did it on your own initiative? Yes, sir. I mean, you can see that you may have disturbed and destroyed evidence in that process. Microscopic or something I didn't see. Well, microscopic, something down in the grass. I mean, you're walking on grass, right? Yes, sir. Not a smooth surface like in the shed, in the feed room, but it's grass at night, correct? Yes, sir. I guess what I'm trying to wonder is what y'all were doing. Were you trying to solve a crime? Were you trying to index everything was there? And when did you find out a sled was coming? So we're trying to mark everything there. As you can tell, there were multiple units coming back and forth, fire rescue as well as sheriff's office. We try to mark it so that it brings awareness to them and it doesn't become disturbed. I'm sorry, I can't understand you. I can't hear you. There were multiple units I've seen, sheriff's office as well as fire rescue. The reason that I saw urgency to mark those shell casings is so that it brings awareness to those of us that were walking around and they don't become disturbed. Well, that brings up the question, should you have been walking around? What do you look, what if you've got two dead people, whoever the perpetrator was, at that point y'all hadn't identified, had you? No, sir. Okay, so the perpetrator may be in the woods across the street as far as you know at that point, right? Could have been anywhere. Right. So you're not trying to solve a crime, you're processing a scene? I'm not processing anything. You don't know what you're doing? I just told you what I was doing, sir. You're marking pieces of evidence? Yes, sir. And the urgency to do that was so that no one else would walk over them? Yes, sir. While you're walking around them? Around them, yes, sir. Well, you don't know whether you actually stepped on one or not, do you? I was very careful not to. Okay. Now, let me also ask you this, that the pattern of the first shell casing was how far away from the feed room? I can't say. What did you find? The first shell casing I found? Yeah. I'm not sure. 10 feet, 20 feet, more than me or further than? Probably about the same distance from me to you. Okay. From the feed room door? Yes, sir. Now, I understand that you fired, you got a blackout, right? Yes, sir. And when you fire that, does it eject to the right or the left? To the right. Mine does. Okay. So if the feed room is where I am, that shell casing ejected to the right, right and forward, right and back? What do you know? Are you asking where the shell casing was in relation to the door? It would have been forward and right of the door. Forward and right of the door. And there was a pattern of casings leading, did they all lead to her body? I can't remember. Did you sketch where you found it? No, sir. I did not do a crime scene sketch. Have you ever done a crime scene sketch? No, sir. Tell me your training in crime scene processing. It's very basic limits of what you would get at the criminal justice academy. Very basic? Yes, sir. So you're not a crime scene processor. Again, and I'm not asking this question repetitively, I'm just trying to puzzle it out. What? You don't know what your role was there. I was a first responder. Well, they were dead, Paul and Maggie, right? You couldn't render them any aid. Your Honor, I would object. No question in that statement. Is there a question? Could you have rendered them aid? Were they in a physical condition where your assistance would have helped? No, sir. They were dead. Correct? Are you asking? Yes, sir. Yes. Okay, let me show you a couple of these clips and ask about them. I've got them here and I've got times. Would you go to 1040? Okay. Okay, this is you walking and these are the dog pens over here to the left, correct? Yes, sir. And on right in front of that one of the dog pens is a hose that is neatly coiled around the hose, something holding the hose, right? That's what it looks like. Okay. Go ahead. How about go to 1112? How you doing? Okay, now this, Mr. Waters asked you about this just a moment ago when he said how you doing when somebody walked up. You would concede to me that but for that one clip he appears to be distraught over the death of his wife and son. He appeared visibly upset. Yes, okay, other than this how you doing sort of thing, right? Correct. Okay, also we see him in a t-shirt and a pair of shorts, correct? Yes, sir. I've looked at your report, I looked at everybody that encountered him that night. No report indicates any blood of this one. You would agree with that? I didn't observe any. What? I did not observe any. It's a white shirt? Yes, sir. If you noted blood on him, you would have made a, you would have put that in your notes or reported that to somebody, right? Yes, sir. Okay. How about WC 1845? It's 300 blood, sir. 300 blood. Okay, one second, that's you apparently determining the shell casing you found is a 300 blood, correct? The one that I marked, yes, sir. The one that was in the gravel? Yes, sir. Just a couple final questions. Since, I have no further questions. Chief Dan Ray. Are you a first responder? Yes, sir. Your first job is safety, correct? Yes, sir. Second job is to protect the scene, is that correct? Objection weeding. Tell me what your jobs as a first responder are again. Yes, sir, we secure the scene, make sure there's no current threat for additional first responders. We then secure the scene, make sure that nobody comes in that's not supposed to, so that we preserve any evidences there. Is part of your training to avoid disturbing the scene as best you can? Yes, sir. Still paying attention to your primary role? Yes, sir. Is part of your training and your experience and what you try to do is if you do see evidence. Objection, your honor. I'll rephrase you. If you are on scene and you do see evidence while you were there, what is your standard operating procedure in that event? I would mark it. And why do you do that? Just to bring awareness to it so that it's not disturbed. Is your job to be a crime scene investigator? Yes, sir. You're just marking that? I'll rephrase. You were asked earlier about apprehending any suspects. Was Mr. Murdock ever in custody? No, sir, not to my recollection. To your observation, was he allowed to move freely? Yes, sir. Was he allowed to interact with people who came to talk to him? Yes, sir. Was he ever placed in the back of a police car? Not that I'm aware of. Never put handcuffs? No, sir. Was he being treated as a suspect when you were there? Not that I'm aware of. Nothing further, your honor. Nothing further, your honor. Thank you. You may step down. I'll put the lights back up. Ladies and gentlemen, we'll break for lunch. We will resume at 2.15. Please do not discuss the case. We will resume at 2.15. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.

Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Please be seated. Anything before the jury comes? Just very quickly, Your Honor, in conversation with Mr. Harpoodlee, and as you're aware, one of the areas that the state intends to go into at some point, subject to Your Honor's ruling, would be the events of what we call the side of the road, and that was the Salkahatchee Road events in September of 2021. We of course have talked with the defense and don't plan to go into that as we've discussed with Your Honor until they've had a chance to make whatever motions Your Honor has had a chance to rule. There may be sled witnesses or other witnesses as we go forward that not only participated in the murder investigation, but also the side of the road investigation. And in discussion with Mr. Harpoodlee, and he's agreed that we can call those witnesses to discuss only the murder with the ability, with Your Honor's permission, to recall them later for the side of the road inasmuch as Your Honor rules any of that relevant and admissible. So I just wanted to put that agreement on the record, Your Honor. Mr. Harpoodlee? That's our agreement. I mean, Your Honor, only one for the caveat. If he would make it clear when he calls the witness so that I know inadvertently stumble into an area we don't want to, if he just designated, if you just say for limited purposes, that'll keep me to stay away from asking questions that might result in me opening the door into the other area. And any such witness will be instructed what the subject matter is for that examination prior to it. Okay. We may bring the jury. Uh... All right, thank you your next witness Denise Bryson Smith Come up here please First name Tanisha last name Bryson Smith BRYSON-SMITH Could you tell the jury where you work? Hampton County E911 And how long have you worked for Hampton County E911? 17 years And what is E911? Emergency Services Dispatch Center And what do you do there? Currently I am in the director position just as stated in December I am over the management of day to day operations of the E911 Dispatch Center for Hampton County Including budgeting, payroll, like I said day to day operations and record keeping, recordings, etc. Does the Hampton County E911 keep records in the normal course of business? We do And what kind of recordings are these? We have audio recordings from 911 phone calls, administrative line phone calls, as well as radio recordings from our radios from the field Are all 911 calls recorded? They are And how are these calls stored? They are stored on our NextLog data recording systems How long are they stored for? As long as we need them And who has access to those records? I do Does anybody else? No, ma'am Just you? Yes, ma'am And how do you access the records? There is a database in my office that I have to log into to access any recordings that is requested Alright Sometimes do calls from another county such as Collidan County come into Hampton County? Yes, they do And why does that happen? Cell phones pick up on the nearest PSAP based upon the location of that cell phone at the time of call PSAP meaning Public Safety Answering System Okay And why does it pick up on the location and send it to Hampton as opposed to Collidan? Due to the geographical location of a phone call or a phone when that call is made, that cell phone picks up at that tower And the tower where the nearest PSAP is is where that cell phone will be routed to And what do you do when you and Hampton County receive a call from Collidan? It's supposed to be going to Collidan County We transfer that call out to Collidan County Okay Alright, back on June 7th of 2021, did you receive a call from Alec Myrdal? We did And that call came into Hampton County, is that correct? That's correct And what happened to that call when it came in? Once it was determined that the call was located, the location of the emergency was Collidan County, we transferred that call out to Collidan County And you determined the Collidan County location how? Based upon the numerics and the address that was given, once we plug that information into our system, it populates in Collidan County By the record of light, I'm showing you a witness takes exhibit 9 State's Exhibit 9 is admitted without objection State's Exhibit 9 is a disc, can you tell us what is on that disc? The initial 911 call that came in on the night in question And how do you know that call is on that disc?

this time the state would move Exhibit 9 into evidence Good afternoon, my name is Jason Walker Chapman, last name CHAPMAN Mr. Chapman, Jason, you stayed in the Interrector, thank you. Tell us a little bit about yourself. Where did you grow up and what education did you obtain? Sure, I'm a native born in Walterboro, I've lived here most of my life, graduated from what was Walterboro High School at the time. I attended the College of Charleston and the University of South Carolina-Sulka-Hatchie before starting my career in law enforcement. I actually joined a cadet program well before age of 21, then became a reserve deputy, dispatcher, and then a class one officer. I've now been doing law enforcement, I'm in my 26th year. 26th year career, would you walk us through when you first got into law enforcement and kind of the roles you've taken on and the training you've done in that? Certainly. In 1997 I attended a reserve officer class, it was a joint class between the College County Sheriff's Office and the Walterboro Police Department. I had to actually wait until I turned 21 to take the final exam, went down to the academy, took the exam, passed, began working as a reserve. I then got hired as a dispatcher at the Walterboro Police Department where I worked short stint as a dispatcher to fill in a hole. And in the spring of 98 I attended the South Carolina Criminal Justice Academy. I graduated later that year, I actually graduated as a distinguished graduate from the academy. Since then I've been doing law enforcement, I did my first 16 years with the city of Walterboro. And I transferred over to the Sheriff's Office January 1, 2013 where I have remained since then. My training has, I've worked through pretty much every division there is in law enforcement, probably with the exception of civil process. I have an extensive background in firearms, I'm a firearms instructor, less than lethal instructor, active shooter instructor. I've had training as a narcotics supervisor, I've been through schools for administration, pretty much everything. What's your current rank with the Sheriff's Department? Currently as captain. And how would you describe your responsibilities presently? So currently I oversee special operations that includes our investigative division, our tactical team, search and rescue. Have you ever had an opportunity to testify as an expert in a trial? I have. Tell us about that. This past year in 2022 I testified in federal court in Charleston, South Carolina on a case involving the city of Beaufort. And I was sworn in as an expert witness in general police procedures. I'm going to direct your attention back to the date of June 7, 2021, are you familiar with that day? Yes sir. What was your role with the Sheriff's Office back on that date? The same as it is currently. Supervising investigations? That's correct. That would include, would that include homicides? Yes sir. Alright, did you have an opportunity, were you dispatched or were you noticed of an incident that occurred on that day? I was. I actually heard the call and went in service before I was dispatched, but yes sir. Alright, what did you hear over the radio? A call coming out that a transfer from Hampton County had been received in which the caller was reporting that his wife and child had been shot. Did you know a location at that point? I was given the location by dispatch, but I was not familiar at the time of the dispatch as to the parties involved. And at that point did you decide that you were going to go to the scene? I did sir. What was the dispatch location? I believe it was 41-42 Moselle Road in Ellington. Were you made aware of who this involved? I was not at the time. Is 41-47 Moselle Road within the limits of Colleton County? It is sir. And walk us through what you did that night upon learning of this incident and then making your way out there. Walk us through that process. Yes sir. I had a brief conversation with Sheriff Phil by telephone while en route. He had been advised of the caller's identity as Mr. Alex Murdock with my career familiar with the Murdock family and Mr. Murdock. And Sheriff Phil advised me that if it was in fact confirmed to be Mr. Murdock that he would likely notify SLED simply because of the conflict of interest with the family. And shortly before we arrived I believe he was able to confirm that. And that call was made to request for assistance from SLED and to request that they actually assume primary in the investigation. Does your department, the Sheriff's Office, do you all work fairly closely with SLED? Is that a common thing? We do sir. All right. Describe that process. I mean not including this particular investigation but in general how have you all worked with SLED as a law enforcement agency? As far as crime scenes, like response to crime scenes, my division works with the entire agency but we work very well with SLED. The remote location, although we have a satellite office for SLED here in Colleton County actually for the low country, their crime scene unit still comes out of Columbia. So middle of the night when they're notified that we may need assistance or in this case that we wanted to take them to take primary in the investigation. Even with the fact that they're emergency services it's still going to be about an average of a two hour response for that crime scene unit once they're notified. So it's very common for us to begin the investigative process at that scene while we're waiting for their arrival with them working jointly with us. And that investigative process usually begins with the acquisition of a search warrant which we know will be required once the crime scene team arrives on scene. And that just comes from a long supported tradition of us working well together and obviously being capable to do so. As a captain and as a supervisor of the investigations, do you typically wear a body worn camera? I do have one at that particular night. I did not have it. It's on my exterior ballistic vest and the scene was secure prior to my arrival, so I did not have my vest on. On arrival at the scene, were you made aware, did you become aware of who in your department had already arrived? I was listening to the radio so that I knew that several patrol units had arrived prior to myself and I believe myself, the sheriff and one other detective arrived probably about 10, 12, 13 minutes after the initial officers. Do you remember the rough approximate time that you arrived on scene? I want to say it was around 10.35, 10.37 p.m. that evening. Walk us through what you observed upon arrival. Sure. So while en route, I reminded the shift supervisor, Sergeant Daniel Green, that to try to maintain the integrity of the scene as best as possible. I wasn't there, so I didn't know the magnitude of the scene. I don't know what he has, but just reminding him, limit personnel inside the scene, do what we can to preserve. Sheriff Hill came across the radio. I was trying to pull the weather up in this particular area I was driving through. I did not have much phone signal, so he did and realized that we had an approaching storm that was about 45 minutes out. So he advised over the radio once he got his phone to pick it up that we needed to secure a tent. I had not been there yet. He was requesting the tent to place over the deceased bodies of the two victims. I relayed that information to one of my lieutenants that was en route. I also turned one of my detectives around that has the longest drive in, which is Detective Rutland, and I informed her to head to the office to start working on a search warrant. Is that your common practice? Yes, sir. You spoke before about you all conducted joint investigations with SLED. Is it common for, well describe for us what your roles might be in a joint investigation and what SLED's role might be and how that played out in this case. Certainly. So the very first thing obviously is a notification for a request for assistance and then the explanation of what exactly we're requesting. A lot of times our assistance is what's requested is nothing more than assistance with the crime scene. Sometimes it may be that we're asking for them to take the entire case. In this case, the notification was made by the sheriff. All I was told was that SLED was responding that they were sending a team of investigators as well as crime scene. Knowing that crime scene was en route. We went ahead and secured that search warrant. That's why Detective Rutland was turned around and sent directly to the office to go and initiate that process. Obviously at 1030 at night we knew that we were going to have to get the warrant typed and then we're going to have to locate a judge in the middle of the evening. We wanted to have all of that done prior to the arrival of the crime scene unit. You touched on earlier a little bit about the weather but describe the weather as it was when you arrived that evening. As I arrived hot, sticky, I recorded in my notes. The only reason I can go back and tell you exactly but what I have recorded in my notes is 79 degrees, 89 percent humidity, hot, sticky. It was not raining yet. An occasional raindrop on the windshield but no actual rain yet. It was a little foggy on my right end but not foggy at the same. Obviously evening hours. I think you mentioned before but rain did set in. How long was it until the rain set in? It wasn't very long. I think the radar was pretty accurate. I want to say within 45 minutes to an hour of that notification the rain did come. You mentioned setting up tents or requesting that tents be set up. What would be the purpose of those tents? In response to the crime scene, obviously preservation of any type of evidence is important but the preservation is not always limited to leaving it there and taking a picture of it and wait for somebody else to get there. In this case, Mother Nature wasn't complying. We knew that the rain was inbound. The tent was placed over victim Maggie's body in an attempt to preserve any evidence that may be there. I only had one at the time. Paul's body was positioned somewhat over an extending ledge that I was hopeful would keep some of the rain if it did start off of him. The other evidence would have been anything from tire tread, footprints, shell casings, anything at all. The intent would be to preserve that as best as possible. If it was going to be effective by the approaching weather, do the best thing we could to mark it out, measure it out, and have that done or partially done by the time crime scene arrived. As far as safety purposes, when you arrived on the scene, would you have considered the scene to be secured at that point? I arrived pretty quick. I know that as far as the immediate, the area that I'm sure that you ladies and gentlemen have seen with the tape and the videos that were played earlier, the immediate scene, yes, the outside, the property is approximately 1700 acres, and it's not just that property. It sits in the middle of nowhere. At the time, we did not know what we had. I don't know if we had an active shooter, didn't know if we had a murder or suicide, didn't know if we had people in the woods. We don't have any idea. So, inter-parameter, secure, I would say yes, sir. Outside, in the woods, across the street, I wasn't sure yet. I didn't know. Is it fair to say that there was a lot of unknowns at that point when you first arrived? There was a lot of unknowns when I first arrived. Very little known other than at the time what they had gotten as initial information from Mr. Murdoch and the fact that we had two deceased. Tell the jury, first of all, let me ask you this. As part of your law enforcement training throughout the years, have you had any experience with or training in, you know, life-saving techniques, if needed? If someone needed CPR or something like that, are you trained in that? Oh, yes, sir. Yes, sir. In arrival on the scene, did you physically observe the two bodies that were present, both of Maggie and Paul? I did, sir. And in your estimation, was it clear to you that they were deceased? Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Did you consider that life-saving techniques would be possible or would have any result? I did not. Paramedics were there shortly before me. Got a great fire rescue. I was assured that if there had been anything that could have been done, it would have been initiated prior to my arrival, but from what I saw, it was well beyond that. Upon your arrival at the scene, were there anyone else present that were not either sheriff's office employees or employees of EMS and fire? Was there anyone else present on the scene? The two victims, Mr. Murdoch and emergency services. You mentioned Mr. Murdoch. Is that Alex Murdoch? Yes, sir. Is he present here today? Yes, sir. You see the defense table, blue blazer, white shirt, and glasses. Did you have an opportunity to observe Mr. Murdoch that night? I did, sir. As part of your responsibilities there, what capacity were you there at the scene? In what capacity? Again, investigative. I realized that we had notified SLED to take over, but again, what we were attempting to do and what we did do was identification of any potential evidence. We marked that potential evidence. If time had allowed, it would have been photographed, and then from that point, simply protected absolutely zero collection of anything was done by any of my staff, with the exception of one GSR kit that was instructed by SLED. I know, have you familiarized yourself with the body worn video of both deputies Green and McDowell? I did, sir. What was your first order of business upon arrival, particularly relating to Paul? By the time I got there, they had placed a sheet over both of the victims. It's something that I'm not always, I don't like. I understand that a lot of times it's placed there, so the family doesn't have to see that, but prefer that it does not happen, but in this case it is already there. Because this scene is still somewhat fluid, we talked about the inner perimeter being secure, but as reported by Mr. Murdoch, we don't know who the defendants are. We don't know where the shooters are. We see shell casings scattered around the ground that are obviously rifle casings. There's some evidence to support that at least one or more shots into Paul were from a shotgun. That means two weapons, so were there two people, or are there other people that may be injured? So, inner perimeter may be considered secure, outer perimeter not so much. So we began really quick with an inspection of the two individuals to make sure that we had not missed a weapon or that the initial responding officers had not missed one. And we could see that Maggie... I wasn't until he told me. We could see that Maggie, there was nothing laying beside her. We looked closely, again we didn't move her, so we went over to Paul, and I had a couple of the deputies there and a detective lift the sheet, just so that we could look and make sure there wasn't a weapon underneath him. His hands were tucked, so you couldn't see underneath his body. But as best we could tell from the present state of the body, unless there was a weapon directly underneath him, there was nothing out to left or right. Captain Chapman, I'm going to direct your focus to the monitor in front of you. I'm going to play what's been marked as state's exhibit number one. Yes, sir. Marked it to the 28 minute mark on that. Just looking at the still image right now, are you familiar with the scene there and can you describe what's going on? Yes, sir. So that's myself, Detective Tyndall Chief McRoy from the Colleton County Fire Rescue, Lieutenant Lonnie Nittles in the background near the perimeter, and victim Paul Murdoch's body to our left there in the open doorway to the feed room. And what are you preparing to do here? At this point in time, double checking to see if there is a weapon. I told you before, we weren't sure whether we're talking about a full murder, a murder or suicide, active shooter scenario, or there are other suspects that may be in the woods. We knew we had the casings that matched to a rifle with some evidence to support a possibly a shotgun. So when asking if any other weapons had been found, everyone stated no. So I had them lift the sheet to make sure there wasn't the barrel of a gun or anything sticking out underneath the body. A little bit about the scene here and your observations of what you're looking at, the kennels directly to the left, if I could direct your attention to those. Yes, sir. Did you notice animals in those kennels? I believe in the 1, 2, 3. There's a couple of kennels closest to the feed room that did have dogs in them. I don't, and possibly one towards the end, they weren't all full, but the ones closest to the feed room, I think there was a dog in at least one or two of them. And was the area wet? The area directly in front of the feed room was like wet, wet. There was also water that tailed out of at least the first two kennels. The rest of the sidewalk was not wet. This and that water, I never saw a hose, so I'm not sure if it was leaking from something, but it was actually standing water. And was that water present consistent with the weather at the time? No, sir. It hadn't rained yet. Not enough to leave you think. It was a drizzle here and there. You observed the body of Paul, was it physically wet as well? He was saturated with obviously blood and tissue, and his clothes did appear to be wet, but almost as if like absorbed from the ground up, not saying that someone had sprayed him with a hose or anything. Please observe the video if you would, and we'll have a few questions afterwards. Do you want to close that in? I don't know who Eric is. I know Alex, I believe. I believe it's him. I believe it's him. I believe it's him. I believe it's him. Did you direct Deputy McDowell into the feed room area to help with lifting of the sheet? I did, sir. And why would you do that? I want the sheet lifted directly up, not drug across the body. Again, I told you I'm not really a proponent of sheets, but since it was there, I would prefer that it be lifted straight up. I had already walked through to see what, if anything, right there. You can see I'm cautiously stepping there, but I'd already checked to see if we were going to be able to step to the inside of it, the spot right inside the door frame. I had looked, and I felt like he would be able to step straight in, pick the sheet up, put the sheet back down, step back out. And is preservation of a scene important? It is important. In your line of work? Absolutely. Is it equally important securing the scene and making sure that you understand if there's any loose firearms around or that there's any other uncontrolled circumstances going on? It is. Again, the sole purpose of this right here is to help determine whether or not I have any suspects still on the move or if there's a weapon underneath him. Thank you. Is this you looking for the gun? It is, sir. What do you notice about the body physically laid there, the pulse body? Feet towards the feed room, head towards the driveway, hands tucked underneath the body, fairly saturated in blood. Majority of the head is gone. There's a lot of tissue, what appears to be at least some of the brain or most of the brain lying on the opposite side from me to the victim. Wet, again, I'm assuming probably from soaking up rain or water, whatever that is off the sidewalk, and a smartphone sitting on, popped up on the back of him. Was Paul's person saturated in physical matter and blood? Yes. And his hands, were they accessible to anyone without, could you have touched Paul's hands or wrists without physically moving him? I can't actually see his hands at this point in time. Is that on top of him? They're underneath his body, yes, sir. What did you observe that was laying on Paul's body right there? Again, it was a smartphone. Did you have a chance to examine that smartphone, get fairly close to it? I got close to it, I didn't pick it up. I was present when it was actually collected later, but it was not collected at this point. And later on it was collected, describe the collection process that occurred after this. It was collected by myself and agent David Owens, I believe he's going to be your case agent. As far as collection of that, I stood by as a witness as he collected. He had on rubber gloves, it was picked up. He didn't actually do any manipulation of the device in front of me. It was bagged as evidence and placed in the vehicle. Was the phone physically bloody? I don't recall any blood or water on the phone. I'm not saying that microscopically there wasn't, but I don't recall from the naked eye seeing anything. That's what I'm asking about. No, sir. From your observations, was it wet from either water or blood? No, sir. And when it was lifted off of Paul's shorts, did it leave like a mark of blood or water or anything like that? Not that I recall, no, sir. I haven't asked the dad about the phone, but he did say he came over and checked the pulses. Beyond that, I don't know if that's the man. He did have a shotgun with him. I have it secured in our vehicle. Were you able to locate a firearm underneath the body of Paul? When the corners officer arrived and the crime scene did it and picked him up, Paul was eventually moved. There was not a firearm underneath. Are you familiar with the rifle round called 300 Blackout? I am, sir. In your 26 years of experience, is that a caliber that you come across with any frequency? In the last couple of years, probably more than ever. But in all the crime scenes that I've worked, I believe this was at the time the second ever in my career that had 300 Blackout as far as being involved in a homicide. As supervisor on the scene, is it part of your responsibility and your duties to sort of direct what people do? You're the person in charge? It is, sir. Does that free you up to do other things if others, if you have your deputies doing the tasks that you have assigned them? If possible, yes, sir. Sometimes. And on this particular instance, in this night, were you able to observe Mr. Murdoch and see what he was up to? Yes, sir. And I spoke to him on a few occasions. Whenever you're investigating a case, I'm going to ask you about items that you might designate as points that you need to address. Yes, sir. You describe what that might mean. What's in general, like an investigative point or investigative cue that you need to focus on? Anything that we hear or see that based on the limited amount of knowledge we have at that particular point just creates a unknown, something that may need further investigation, something that maybe doesn't necessarily correspond with the evidence on scene or with the statement made by somebody. It's something that just we need to follow up on. It can't just be left alone or accepted as fact. What are some of the physical observations? I'm going to ask you about physical observations of Mr. Murdoch. Did he appear to be, at least outwardly, did he appear to be upset? Yes, sir, he did. Did you, were you close enough to observe whether or not he actually cried, right, tears in his eyes? He was upset, definitely upset. I got up to him, again, like I said, I spoke to him on at least two different occasions, and he was breathing hard. His facial expressions were that of torment, but did I physically see him crying? I did not. He was sweating, but he wasn't crying. What did you observe about his clothing? Clothing was clean, didn't see anything that stuck out, and obviously no dirt or blood or anything that indicated he had been rolling around on the ground or that he had been involved or anything up to that point. I'm going to ask you about something you do when you're arriving on a scene, particularly if it's a homicide. Do you have a practice of phoning or having a dispatch send you the 911 call? Yes, we do. Why would you do that? We get a lot of information from 911 calls, more so than the average person I think would believe. And it's, over the years we've had several cases where, had we not gone back and looked at that initial 911 call, we would have missed some very important information, or information that could have cleared up some unknowns, those points of investigation you talked about much sooner. So in our investigator process, that's now one of the things that we try to do relatively quickly. In this case, with the scene being fluid and not knowing if we had suspects on the loose, I opted to go ahead and do that. And it took a minute for them to get caught up as busy as they were, but they were able to get on the phone with me and play the 911 call for me. So were you able to hear the 911 call? I was. And are you listening to that 911 call, both for content but also critically, and trying to examine the things that are said? Absolutely. We're listening for noises in the background, exactly what is said versus what we see, so forth. So with that awareness of everything that was said on the 911 call, do you then take that information and apply it to the scene? Yes, sir. And are you applying that information to try to see if it checks out, to see if things are consistent with what you heard on the 911 call? Yes, sir. And on the 911 call, did Mr. Murdaugh indicate that he had tried to examine the bodies or check their pulses? Yes, I believe Dispatch stated, do not touch if you haven't, and Mr. Murdaugh replied that he had touched them, checking them. To check and see if they're breathing? Which would be expected, absolutely. Upon examination, Mr. Murdaugh, did you have a chance to look at his hands? Again, I did talk to him, yes, sir. And did you have a chance to look at his shirt? I did. And did you see any indication that there was any blood on any part of his body? No, not, again, just physically with my observations, no microscope, I did not see any blood anywhere. And in your experience with viewing Paul's body, had you physically touched Paul, would there have been blood left on your hands? Yes, sir, on speculation. Response? He physically saw the body, and he can testify to the locations that would be touched and whether it would transfer. Does he know what location he touched? All in combination, I'll ask a few more questions. Mr. Chaffin, going back to your experience in life-saving procedures, are there common areas that someone might touch to check the pulse if they were indicating they're checked breathing? Objection, Your Honor, the question is, where did Mr. Murdoch touch the body for a pulse? Was it the neck? Objection. Overruled. The prosecutor is asking the question. Go ahead. Thank you, Your Honor. Is there common areas that someone might check a body to check for, if they've indicated they're checking for breathing, are there common areas that someone might check? I believe the most common, the neck and the wrist, that you see that people with limited training would probably use. I'm sure there are others with medical training. So the neck and the wrist. And please tell me where Paul's wrists were located when you discovered his body. They're up underneath his body. And was Paul's neck accessible? If his wrists were underneath his body, was his neck accessible? I think you can get the portions of his neck. I don't know that you'd be able to get underneath. I mean, he's face down, and I didn't try to get a pulse, but where I know that you would check would be difficult without manipulating the body in some fashion, I guess. And if you had to manipulate the body, and if you were going to try to check his pulse, be it wrists or neck, with what you saw that night, would your hands be bloody? If I had attempted, they would have been, yes. I'm going to ask you another investigative point that you observed. Did Mr. Murdoch in the 911 call indicate he was going to retrieve a firearm? Yes, sir. That actually came out while I was en route as a caution from the dispatcher, but it was also present on the call when I monitored the call. Having listened to the phone call, having listened to the 911 tape, what was your reaction, what was the cue that you were fixated on as it relates to the retrieval of the firearm? What is going through your head at that point? I mean, I think that he was scared, that he believes there may be somebody there that possibly whoever he believes hurt them may come back and hurt him. And sure, that's your estimation, right? That's what you're thinking. That's what I was thinking, yeah, and that's what I believe pretty much anybody would think if he was there, present with them, and got spooked. Because I believe the verbiage on the 911 is he states, I'm going to get a gun, that I don't feel safe. And the dispatch tries to tell him we would rather you not, and he states again that I'm not going to show it to the officers, I'm not going to hurt anybody, I'll put it away, but I feel I'm safe, so I understand that. All right, listen to the 911 call critically, what then did you observe towards the end after retrieving a firearm that you would cue onto in your investigative process? After knowing that he had went and got the gun, knowing that he stated he was unsafe and that he went and got the firearm there, when he came back, as soon as he got back to the scene, the only thing I believe that was odd from that point was that he wanted to separate the call or cancel the call to call family prior to anyone's arrival. It was the only thing that just struck me as odd. Again, it's just a point of investigation. Up to that point in the phone call, he had asked repeatedly, where are they, are y'all coming, are y'all coming, are y'all coming, I'm not safe, I'm going to go get a gun, and then when he got back to the scene, are y'all here yet, how far out are they, and then it was, I need to call my family, and the phone disconnected. And when we refer to the scene, the scene is obviously, does that uncover part of what was fenced off with crime scene tape, does that, when referring to a scene? That would have been the primary scene, yes sir. But in your mind, what does the scene also entail? What other things? Well, I mean, the only thing that, the phone could potentially extend that scene, the phone calls, could potentially extend that scene as far as entering a crime scene and not being able to introduce evidence or exiting a crime scene without being able to take away evidence, and by his own admission, he left the scene, went to his house and got a gun. Potentially, that could make the house an extension of the crime scene. Because that's what he indicated on the phone call. That's what he indicated. Does, is Mr. Murdoch consider part of that scene, the scene? Of course. He's inside that area when we arrive, and I mean, he would be factored into everything. And would that justify or explain why you might pay particular attention to him? Sure. I mean, would anybody that was there. You've, and I'm asking you this again, I know you've answered, but you've had a chance to review the body-worn camera from both Deputy Green and Mcdowell. Yes sir. Did your, after those videos cease recording because the crime scene had been secured, did you have an opportunity then to continue your investigation and continue your line of work? We did. And those, these activities would not have been captured on the video because it had been shut down? That's correct. Did you have an opportunity to physically observe, meaning watch Mr. Murdoch while your deputies and your officers were performing their tasks? I did. What were a couple of the things that you noticed that stuck out to you when physically observing Mr. Murdoch and how he was either behaving or what he was doing? Again, I mean, he was emotional. The stress on his face. I didn't, I didn't see him cry. Not everyone cries. I don't have an issue with that. There were times that when we got to certain places or asked certain questions that you could see a slight demeanor change or body language shift. And I took note of that, but again, just as a point of investigation, but he remained at the scene. He wasn't forced to say he was cooperative, but there were times that you could see reaction to different things. Did you notice a reaction? Did you ever notice him tracking your movements or your officers' movements? I know when I was there when I ordered Detective Barnado to take a GSR kit and explain how the kit worked and why we were taking it. He was very cooperative with giving the kit and we really didn't have an issue there. Later, I was looking at some, I wouldn't call them tire tracks. I call them tire impressions because there's no dirt there. It's just grass, but we noticed there was quite a bit of tire impressions that ran around the backside of the hanger. And we'll get to the tire tracks in a second. You mentioned a term just a second ago called GSR. Yes, sir. If you wouldn't mind, could you explain to us what that is? Sure. I apologize for that. So a gunshot residue kit is just a kit. We use specific kits provided by SLED because the kits are then sent off for testing. It's meant to test for the presence of gunshot residue. They're very non-invasive. They have little ampules. You open up a sterile kit, put a set of gloves on, open the kit up, and you'll dab one of the sterile collectors around on the front and back of the hand of an individual, package those up, tape it off, seal it, date it, time it, case number, and then that's eventually sent off to SLED. We were asked, I spoke earlier and said the only thing that my detectives physically collected prior to SLED's crime scenes arrival was that GSR kit. It was done by us because there is a time limit on those. And you can't always wait. I know everybody sometimes thinks, well, why don't we just wait and do all this tomorrow? But GSR has a six-hour limit on it. So we had to collect that that night, and we did so. And that's what I was referring to when I say GSR, the gunshot residue test kit. And Captain Chabin, related to the GSR retrieval, I know you mentioned that time limit, the expiring time limit. Is it your understanding that that time limit, does that time limit refer to humans or just things in general, objects in general? That refers to when we collect a GSR sample from an individual. That is our restriction from the SLED lab. It has to be collected within six hours of the estimated time of firing the weapon. And again, that kit, I mean, it's just as much for any type of exculpatory as his conviction. We use it a lot of times to exonerate someone as much as we would to convict. Going back to Mr. Murdoch's observations that you had, did he appear to fixate on one body or the other that were there? Especially watching the camera footage, I didn't notice quite as much in person, but later scrutinizing the body cam footage, he does appear to fixate more on his son than his wife, but that's in that limited amount of body cam footage that I have. You mentioned before the tire tracks that you observed. Yes, sir. Tire impressions. Tire impressions. Yes, sir. Can you set the scene for us if you would, please? Describing the grass, and we've heard a lot about, you know, there's rain, but moisture. Describe the scene if you would on that grass. So if you come into the property and you go down the dirt road with Paul on your left, as you see in the picture before you all, that gravel or dirt road between the kennels and the, what's referred to as the airport or the airplane hangar, eventually ends in grass, a large grass area that separates that hangar from another shed. And in that area is where Mr. Murdoch's suburban was parked with the flashers and the headlights, and the headlights were pointed towards Paul's body. That entire area there is grass as opposed to the dirt or gravel lane between the two structures, and there's some very obvious at that time impressions in the grass, but they're not tracks like you think of that you, we could cast a track out of dirt, but you can't cast an impression that's in laid over wet grass from the dew. I mean, you're not going to be able to do anything with that other than to document it. And I did notice them, and I actually asked Mr. Murdoch if he could tell me, because I was unaware of the body cam footage at the time, could you tell me what direction you came from, and he told me that he pointed and said he had come from the residence and pulled up here, turned around and went back the same route, confirming that the tracks around his vehicle, the suburban, were his. And he said there should be two sets from where I arrived the first time left and went my got the gun and came back. And I asked about the other sets that you could see, and there was one in particular that appeared to come close to Maggie's body, possibly. You had to have the light just right, and it just happened to be that I noticed it looking at the ground in front of Mr. Murdoch's vehicle because the lights were shining on Paul that you could see that. So the tire tracks. Did you and Detective Rotland spent some time trying to or attempting to identify where those tracks could have come from. We did try to follow them. One thing that started to bother me was that we didn't have a vehicle. We're trying to figure out how Maggie and Paul got to the to the kennels. It's a pretty substantial distance from the residence to the kennels, the property, you know, I don't know an exact but I'm guessing probably 1000 yards from the kennels to the house. And it's 10 o'clock at night, so I don't know what time they got there but it's pretty long walk, especially if you're planning on walking back in the dark. And did they drive a vehicle did they drive a four wheeler or a UTV or whatever golf cart but we see Mr. Murdoch's vehicle, and because he left it as instructed where it was. But we were trying to determine if any of these other tracks lined up with the position of any other vehicles that were on the property, there was a UTV with a flat tire. There was another half ton pickup in the shed across the grass portion from the hanger. I was thinking maybe those tracks would line up over the impressions that when the grass would line up with that vehicle. They did not. Part of your investigation of flash board and just just a little bit did you operate and record to drone videos of the property idea. Marked as states exhibit 187 and 188. Those DVDs. That's an abstraction and ladies and gentlemen we'll take a recess at this time. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. please be seated You may bring the jury. All of the the jury is present. All right, thank you. You may proceed. Thank you, Your Honor. Thank you, Mr. President. Mr. Chairman, we're moving our testimony. I'm going to show you a handful of pictures. I'm going to mark. I've marked and I'm going to ask you to please identify them. Objection. You offer them all in the evidence? I am. They are admitted without objection. Okay. Permission to publish? Yes. And I think, Your Honor, I think we've already established that the drone footage has been placed into evidence and I would request permission to play that first and then I'll go to the next one. Captain Chapman, as we were discussing earlier, you did record, describe the process of what you did with the drones and why you surveilled the area. I took pictures with our drone just to give an overall. Some of the agents have different job descriptions that day. Some of my personnel had different job descriptions that day. In order to have something as a reference point to go back and work with later, we took the department-issued drone and took a couple aerial videos so that we could use them for reference later. And, Your Honor, I request permission for the witness to sort of direct the geography of the drone footage. If you would please step down. Sure. And we could identify for the jurors as the videos played what we're actually looking at. I appreciate it. Your Honor, in the image currently, what we see is the main house in the room of the residents. And that's the one that retreats would be the main driveway that comes out. If you could identify that on the video, the driveway that you're referring to. So this would be the main structure and the main driveway that comes out from it with the trees. Ladies and gentlemen, the main structure, the residential structure, and the driveway coming away from it with the trees. All right. And now looking down the road a bit, Captain Chapman, this road that veers to the left or turns left, what is that road? So that would have been the route that was described by Mr. Murdock as how he left his residence and came to the dog kennels, coming up the road with the planted trees, making a left here, ladies and gentlemen, there. And if you play the video a little farther, that road ends at the instant location with the dog kennels. And if you would please describe for us what we're actually looking at with this dog kennel area, identifying the structures and the entry point for the road, the main mailbox area. Absolutely. So this would be the area coming from the main residence. When we arrived on scene that night, or at least when I arrived, right here, positioned with the headlights facing down this way, would have been Mr. Murdock's vehicle. You keep hearing reference of the airplane hanger or the main shed. That would have been the large structure here. The dog kennels are the smaller one you see in the background that runs up the digger, and the driveway goes out to the road. Do I need to show you, ladies and gentlemen, here? Does everyone want to please do it? Sure. Just go through what these structures are. So again, the roadway coming from the main residence. Here you have what's been referred to as the hanger. Mr. Murdock's vehicle was part of this general area here with the headlights shining down this direction. This is the dog kennels. This is the large grass area that we were referring to when we were talking about the tire impressions in the dig. And this is a separate structure that sits off to the side. And where would the entry point for the Moselle Road be on this distilled shot? Following straight down between the hanger and the dog kennels, going all the way through the treeline, the Moselle Road entrance would be back here. I'm going to just play it one time without stopping. All right. Thank you, Captain Chatlin. I'm going to play the second drone video. If you would, please tell us what we're looking at from this perspective right now. Yes, sir. So this would be the back portion of the airplane hanger. The driveway, the vehicles at the bottom of the screen, this driveway goes back around and connects back to Moselle Road. And is this the hanger that you were referring to? This is the airplane hanger, as we've been referring to it. What is this structure on the top side of this image in the far back? I believe that would say cleaning shed for processing shed for animals. If you were going to process a deer that you killed and had it like a walk-in freezer, it sinks floor with drain in it. All right. Describe to us what we're looking at from this perspective, if you would. Certainly. So if you came in the Moselle entrance, which was the entrance that we were dispatched to, the 4147, and you turned by the mailbox off of Moselle Road, and you came in the dirt driveway, you would be coming up between the two structures. You have your airport or airplane hanger on your right with the red tin roof, the dog kennel on your left. That was the vehicle that Mr. Murdoch was driving when, at least, what was, he said he was driving when I arrived on scene. At the time, the flashers were, I believe they actually still are in the drone video. The hazard lights are on all the way back from where dispatch initially advised him to cut them on for arrival. The large shed in the background out there is just simply another tractor shed. And Captain Chapman, would you identify where the body of Paul Murdoch was located when you arrived on this picture? So the dog kennel is on the left of your screen, ladies and gentlemen. If you were to look towards the end of that structure, right where the gravel and the roof line are, and then step back approximately five, six feet, that would have been the location of Paul's body. And where would Maggie's body have been located? And Maggie's body would have been just beyond the roof line of the red airplane hanger on the side closest to the suburban. The trajectory of the vehicle that Mr. Murdoch was operating and actually left parked there, where would his headlights have been directed to? As it sits now, which I believe is the same it was when I arrived on scene, the headlights were pointed on Paul's body. And this structure just past the white roof, which is identified as the kennels, what's that run structure there? I believe that was like a chicken coop or a chicken pen. I mentioned before when we were talking about the tire tracks that you noticed in the dew of the grass that you were trying to identify the location of those tracks. As part of your investigation in conjunction with Detective Rutland, did you identify this black truck that we see pictured here? We did. Was the black truck, did any of the tracks line up to that black truck? No, sir, that's what got us back to that location looking at the tire impressions, was that we were trying to determine if that was the vehicle we believe that Paul may have driven to the kennels. And did you check the truck to see if it was physically warm to the touch or had it turned on? It was not. Also here, Chapman, the kennel run, I think you already identified, is that the structure with the white roof? Yes, sir. The silverish white roof in the background on this image? Yes, sir. And if you look at the feed room located where Paul actually was sort of straddled, where would that feed room be in this image? If you look at the right corner of that building, and you can see the white framed door just above the red roof, that would be the area of the feed room. And with the court's permission, I'd ask the witness to identify that on the screen if you would. Yes, sir. Please, this would be the area of the feed room here. This would be the area of the feed room here. And while you're there, Captain Chapman, would you please identify in this angle where Maggie Murdahl would have been located? Yes, sir. Maggie was in this angle here. Here. Did you become aware, through the course of your investigation, of footprints on the side of the hanger? Yes. How did that occur? What brought your attention to that first, and what did you do as a result? Detective Rutland approached me at some point in time after her arrival with the search warrant that she had located a set of prints. The prints appeared to be a flat style print, like a flip-flop or a sandal of some type, and that they were to the left of this hanger door in the dirt underneath the left lean-to of the hanger. And if you mean to the left of the door in the image, do you identify an orange lawnmower there? That's correct, in between that mower and the wall. If you would describe what you did and what you and Detective Rutland decided to do to examine these footprints. She came over and alerted me to the presence of the footprints or shoe impressions. I went over with her. We started at the side of the hanger here that you see in the image by the orange mower. At that particular point, you could only see those sets of tracks or shoe impressions in the dirt. We then walked around the other side, and you could see that they were also on the other side of the hanger, the far side of that structure. So then we made the decision to walk a line off of those tracks from one end to the other to ensure that there was no evidence of firearms, blood, anything underneath that hanger along those shoe impressions, which we did not locate anything but the single set of shoe impressions. And they appeared to go from one end of the hanger to the other, turn around and come back. I'm going to show you what's been entered to evidence as states exhibit 193. Are you familiar with that location? Yes, sir. Is that a still image of the area between the hanger and that lawn mower? It is, sir. And is that the location where you notice the treads, the footprints? It is, sir. I'm handing you what's been marked as states exhibit 194. Could you please describe what you see in that picture? This is a picture of the footprints along the edge of the hanger structure. I'm handing you what's been marked and entered into evidence as states exhibit 195. Please describe what you see in that picture. Again, another photograph depicting the shoe impressions along the edge of the wall. And those are the shoe impressions that you personally viewed on scene at Mizzou? Yes, sir. I'm also handing you what's been entered into evidence as states exhibit 200. Are you familiar with what that is a picture of? These are the shoes that were on Miss Maggie at the time. I believe they're crime scene or autopsy photos from afterwards. Okay. Okay. I'm Chavar. We've seen a rear view of a car operated by Mr. Myrtle that night. Is that accurate? Yes, sir. And is that, are those headlines directly aligned with where Paul's body would have been laid? Yes, sir. And from this perspective, where was Maggie's body located? Close to the front of the Green Ranger to the left of the vehicle. And did Mr. Myrtle indicate he drove to the scene from? Which direction would that have come from? Bottom right hand corner of the picture that you're seeing now. I can switch to. All right, Captain Chapman, I'm just asking you to identify just very quickly. These are stills from the video feed. What does that show? That's the dirt road between the hanger and the dog kennels. Okay, that would be states exhibit 192. This is states exhibit 191. And what does that show? That's the, like we said, a cleaning shed, processing shed for animals, had a walk-in freezer floor with a drain in it. I'm showing you states exhibit 190. What is that image of? Looks like the area of the first two kennels closest to the... Does that reflect the two kennels with the two dogs on either side closest to the feed room? Closest to the feed room. And I'm showing you what's marked as states exhibit 189. That's the... Is that another close up of the water? That's close up of the water just outside the feed room. And I'm referring to the pictures we just reviewed. This would be states exhibit 193. Is that where you physically walked with Detective Rutland? It is, sir. And to be clear, when you observed the footsteps in the sand there, were they the only footsteps present? There was only one style of shoe impression when we first observed that went from one side of the hanger to the other and back. And it was that smooth style shoe impression. And you say there and back, does that mean the footprints to you indicated they had walked one direction and then walked the opposite direction back? Is that what you're referring to? Yes, sir. We weren't able to tell at which point which side they entered initially, but they walked completely from one side of the hanger all the way underneath the lean to the other side of the hanger, turn around and come back. I'm now showing you what's been marked as states exhibit 194. Describe the types of treads we're seeing in this picture, if you could. Certainly. If you remember, I stated earlier that after locating the shoe impressions, Detective Rutland let me know that the impressions were there. I went over, we checked both sides and realized that they ran what we could tell with a flashlight from one side to the other. So we made the decision to walk straight through keeping the shoe impressions that we were concerned about in between ourselves and the wall of the hanger structure, never crossing those actual shoe impressions. We went from one end to the other just to see if they were joined by any other shoe impressions, if there was any blood, if there any weapons, so forth. We made one trip down and back and we did not locate anything. And I'm now showing you what's been marked as states exhibit 195. Would that be a close up of these impressions that you observed? It is, sir. And specifically the items in the middle with the flat tread, would those be the footprints that you noticed that night? Those were the ones initially identified by Detective Rutland and pointed out to myself. The ones with the shoe impressions with the actual designs that would be left of those in this photograph, those are myself and Detective Rutland. I'm going to move to publish what's been marked as entered into evidence as states exhibit 196 and 197. These are images of sensitive nature, have the cover sheet on the advice council and our table to obscure the monitors. Showing you what's been marked and entered into evidence as states exhibit 196. Are you familiar with what this is an image of? Yes, sir. What does this show? That's the lower portion of victim Maggie's body. And specifically referring to the lower portion of the body that are footwear. Are these the footwear that you observed on her that evening? Those appear to be an accurate reflection of what she was wearing the night I was there. Were you able to compare those general size and shape of those foot treads to the ones that you personally observed on the side of that hanger? General impression, they are similar in nature and design and size. There were no measurements physically taken by myself or Detective Rutland. Thank you. I'm publishing what's been marked and placed into evidence as states exhibit 197. And this is a similar photograph with just a slightly different angle. Is that the same treads and same footwear that you observed previously? Again, we believe that what we saw on the side of the building is a very close match as far as design and size as to those. I'm showing you now what's been marked and placed into evidence as states exhibit 200. Are you familiar with that? I know you already described it, but tell us again what we're looking at. Again, those were the shoes that were removed from victim Maggie's body at the scene and the ones that we were visibly comparing the shoe impressions to. Did you at one point have a Be On The Lookout or a Molo placed in particular in a vehicle that night? Yes, sir. I believe I explained earlier that we had asked if anything was missing from the scene and trying to determine how Maggie and Paul got to the dog kennels. And after checking the F-150 that was in the picture we showed you earlier, the dark colored F-150, and the Ranger had a flat tire, neither one of those matched up. I actually asked Mr. Murdock if he knew how they got down there, and he said he wasn't sure, but they should have driven Paul's truck, which was described as a white Ford F-250. We noticed that the truck wasn't there. It wasn't up until that point that Mr. Murdock, probably with everything going on, did not realize the truck wasn't there. And at that point in time to our units at our agency it was followed out as possibly having been taken from the scene or removed from the scene. And what happened? Were you able to locate the car eventually? That, again, that was done sometime that night while we were on scene the very following morning, and I'd have to look back at notes to tell you exactly, but I believe it was around 1030, 1045 the next morning. That vehicle was located just inside Hampton County off of Highway 63. Captain Chapman, referring back to the tire tracks, I know you spent some effort trying to identify the source and origin of those tire tracks. When you were attempting to investigate those tire tracks with Detective Rotland, did you have a chance to then observe Mr. Murdock's demeanor? Yes, sir. And we discussed, you know, there were changes at the time. What kind of changes? Again, he did appear very upset, heavy breathing, distraught. When we asked the specific questions in regards to the tire impressions and we began looking at the tire impressions, it was just a change. The breathing slowed and he began to watch us work more closely, sometimes out the corner of his eye. And after we moved away from that area with the tire impressions, the demeanor change returned back to upset. Thank the court's indulgence. No further questions from the state. Thank you, Captain Chapman. Sir. My name is Dick Harpoogian. I don't think we've met before. No, sir. I represent Alex Murdock. And let me ask you a couple questions. One, and let me deal with these in a different order. But you indicated that if Mr. Murdock had taken the pulse, had tried to take the pulse of his dead son on his neck or his wrists were under him, did he indicate to you he tried to roll his son over? To me, no, sir. He did not. Okay, tried to move him at all. Secondly, if he did get blood on his fingers or hands, were you aware that there was blood found on his shorts? I was not, sir. Again, I was asked only about my visible observations and just did not see anything at the time. Right, nothing on his shirt that he indicated. No, sir. Okay. And I was unaware that anything was found. But you're not saying that he, I mean, you didn't see anything that would confirm, but he didn't smear blood on himself. That's correct. Right. That is correct. But you're not saying that you have evidence he didn't try to check the pulse of his dead son. I am not, no, sir. Okay. So, and I think you indicated that his demeanor was consistent with somebody who had just found his wife and son Butcher. His demeanor upon my arrival and initial conversation with him was one of someone who was upset. Okay, now let's talk, just a moment ago you said something about when you started looking at the tire tracks on the grass, in the grass. It was a change of demeanor, yes, sir. Well, a change of demeanor that perhaps he thought you had some evidence that would point to the killers of his killers or killer of his wife and child. Are you asking me if that was the change? Was the demeanor consistent with that? It was simply a change in demeanor. Right. It could be. Yes. Sure, it absolutely could be. It was just a noted change of demeanor. It's interesting. Exactly. Right. Yes, sir. You were over there looking at tire tracks and perhaps you had discovered a different car or a different tire track or, and did you follow all those tire tracks? We attempted to follow out everything we could as mentioned earlier. It was just impressions, due impressions, wet impressions, not actual tracks. Did you take pictures? By the time that we did that, the rain started and Sled's crime scene was arrived. Again, we were rushing against the weather. The images, I believe, we discussed earlier were the only ones captured by body cam. Right. And it's the body cam is not. Our focus at the time was to secure the largest items of evidence that were identifiable to make sure that the weather didn't damage them and by that time Sled's team was on scene. Okay. And now there was two other sets of tracks, one of them coming out of the shed. I believe your notes indicate that was the caretaker or the caretakers. Now, was that the caretaker that took care of the dogs or somebody else? There was a set of tire tracks or impressions that went through the dirt underneath the hanger. Right. Leaned to. Initially, we didn't know who they were, what vehicle had left those tracks, and the drone footage, you can actually see the agent still processing those. I believe that later I was told that they matched the tire tracks of someone that came to take care of the dogs. Okay. Now, we heard from the fire chief a little while ago. Were you here in the courtroom? No, sir, I was not. Okay. He indicated that there were on the road that led out to the Moselle Highway. You know what I'm talking about? Yes, sir. No. Overview of the housing camera. Okay. So were you informed that the chief of police had found some tire tracks on the road leading in or out from to the Moselle Highway behind, and if you look at the screen, this road where the cars are parked on either side of the road, that is that road, correct? For clarification, the chief of the fire department or chief of the police department? I'm sorry, chief of the fire department. I just want to make sure I was answering correctly, sir. Yes, I was not made aware by Chief McCroy of anything back there, but it doesn't mean that he didn't see something. He apparently informed your deputies of that. They never communicated that to you? I was not made aware of any tire impressions of potential evidence down that driveway. And I think Sergeant Green indicated that it was communicated to him by the fire chief. Were you aware of that? I was not, sir. Until I just said it, you were not aware of that? I was not made aware of anything that they believe was a possible extension of the scene that went down that driveway. No, sir, I wasn't. If the fire chief had seen and he was testified he saw distinct tire tracks on that road, he thought it had some evidentiary value, not a police officer. Had you been made aware of them, would you have taken photographs or I guess they don't use plaster casts anymore, yes? We still do. Yes, sir. I would have done my best to preserve it, whether that meant photographic form or protection by other means from the approach, I would have. Okay, so go ahead and let that run for a minute. I may want to stop it and deal with another issue. Okay, stop it right there. Yeah, right there is good. Now, if you'll watch where I'm pointing to. Yes, sir. These are the dog, that's the dog shed right there, right? That is correct, sir. And right around in here would have been where Paul's body was. Close to the end of that structure, yes, sir. And Maggie's body would have been on which side of Alex Carr? The end of the red roof on the driver's side. Right, now are you aware that he discovered the bodies, called 911, drove back up to the house and then came back down? From listening to his statement and from the 911 call, I was aware of it, yes. And he went and got a shotgun and came back. Yes, sir. And the shotgun was there, which sort of corroborates his statement, right? I was made aware of that, yes, sir, that Sergeant Green took the shotgun from him upon his arrival on security. And you can also hear the seatbelt dinging going on as he drives away, you know? You can hear that in the background of the 911 call. Right, so this is where he came back, not necessarily when he pulled up to begin with, correct? My understanding, that is the way the vehicle was when he returned and the initial officers arrived on scene. Right, so you don't know where the car was positioned. We first came down and discovered Maggie's body and Paul's body, correct? My knowledge to it would be limited to his description of having taken a very similar route back to the house, but I'd... Close? Close, but not exact, yes, sir. Now, what is this green hedge or whatever? If I'm not mistaken, it was a grapevine, but the structure on the other side of it, a chicken coop. Okay, and do you remember how tall that grapevine was? I don't know exactly, but looking at the image, it's fairly tall. Ten feet? I would say at least. At least. Now, if you were at the house looking down this way, there's some pine trees between this area and the house? There are, sir. And then there's, if you're trying to look at the dog pens, there's obviously a ten-foot, at least... What'd you call it? The kennels? No, the vine. Grapevines? Grapevines. Yes, sir. Ten feet tall. So you could not see from the house the dog kennels because of the pine trees and the grapevine, correct? I would venture to say you could not see the position of Paul or Maggie's body from the house. At night? At night. Right. And this is not a well-lit area down there, is it? I don't recall it being extremely well lit, no, sir. There was some artificial light, but I wouldn't call it extremely well lit. Okay. So... Go ahead and continue running the video, please. And this was on the next morning? Yes, sir. Okay. Okay, stop. That black truck. Whose black truck is that? That's the vehicle that we checked that evening that I believe was titled as a farm truck, just around the farm truck. And is that the one you checked to see if it had been driven lately? That's the one that Detective Rutland and I looked to see if those wet tire impressions matched up to the position of that vehicle when we arrived. Those particular impressions did not, and the vehicle was not warm to the touch. Okay, but that would have been the night, previous night? The night of the incident when we arrived, yes, sir. The night prior to this. But that, could Paul have driven that truck down there? It would have been on what time he drove the truck down there, but the impressions that we were looking at that we referenced when asked earlier by the Assistant Attorney General, they did not come to the back of that vehicle. They didn't come from that vehicle. Did he drive that vehicle to the scene? I can't tell you that, yes or no, but the impressions that she and I were looking at did not match the position of that vehicle. Right. Yes, sir. But if Paul earlier could have driven that down there? He could have. It's very feasible he could have driven anything out there that night, earlier in that day, but just not that vehicle for those particular set of impressions. Okay, go ahead. Okay, back that up just a little bit please. Back it up. Now, stop. So the tracks that you found from the caretaker, where were they? In the image that you're looking at now, ladies and gentlemen, they would have been to the right of the open door in the center, underneath that large lean-to section. Could you come down here and point it out for me? Yes. Thank you, sir. You can actually see the agent's feet there, where she's still actually processing. Okay. Were there any other tire tracks? Any other tire tracks? Go ahead and take it. Thanks. Did they actually process all of the other tire tracks? No, they didn't. They were all processed other than those tire tracks. To my knowledge, that was the only set that they actually, I believe the only set that they actually processed by then. The only one left that wasn't damaged by weather as well. Okay. Go ahead. So, and this road here goes out to Moselle Highway, right? If you were to take the right T there by the silver trucks, if you took the right, that would go out to Moselle Road. The left just loops around the airplane hanger. Okay. And if the Fire Chief had indicated there were tire impressions back here in the dirt, he would have taken pictures or gotten plastic ass or something, right? If I had been made aware that there was something there that someone thought may possibly be evidence, I would have done my best to secure it. But I was not made aware of any of that. Thank you. Yes. Can you put the other one up, please? That's the main house, the white building there. Yes, sir. And that, if you kept going straight, you'd hit the Moselle Highway, right? If you continued straight out the driveway with the planted trees on either side, that would be a separate entrance from the farm entrance. It would have been the main entrance to the residence itself off of Moselle Road. Right, the main entrance would come to the residence. That's correct. If you're going to the residence, you'd come in that entrance. That is correct. Going down to the dog pens, that area, the farm area, you take the entrance with the post office box on. Okay, go ahead. That's actually all I need to add on. Thank you. Let me ask you a few more questions. The photos of the footwear, I think the flip-flops or whatever, in one of your reports, you described that as it looked to you like someone had been pacing. Is that correct? I did describe it as pacing, I believe. Is that accurate? Simply because it goes down, turns around, and comes back. It doesn't appear to veer off anywhere in between. And there's nothing, it doesn't start anywhere in particular, and anywhere in particular, it goes all the way across, turns around, and comes all the way back. Okay, and the pictures that were put into evidence a moment ago. Can I use the helmet, please? Is that more? 195. So as we see in this picture, we see these flat marks, right? That would be the flip-flops. The impressions we were following, yes, sir. Yes. So they're like right here and here and here, and in some instances, these look like, actually we blew one up and it's got an REI symbol in the middle of them. And they're in at least one instance over the flip-flop. So how do you use that? The only prints that I'm aware of that we could see that night without blowing anything up was the image of the flat shoe wear that you see, and then what Detective Rutland and myself were wearing when we crossed through. I mean, is this y'all? Would you have walked over there or here? Presumably so, because those images weren't there prior to us walking through. I don't remember exactly what shoe style Detective Rutland was wearing and myself. So let me put this one up. And you can see the pattern of flip-flops, but you also see these patterned boots or shoes over the flip-flops. Are you telling me those were not there the night before or you couldn't see them? No, sir. What I'm telling you is when Detective Rutland and I first observed those impressions, there was nothing but a smooth, small flip-flop style impression. Went down from one end, all crossed underneath the hanger all the way to the other, turned around and came back, which is the reason that I represent as being a pace. Had it simply crossed underneath, I would have just said crossed underneath. But those were the only impressions. Then she and I walked down the shed keeping those tire, or excuse me, shoe impressions between us and the wall without stepping on them. So those were not? But we did not photograph them. That information from that point was relayed to crime scene because we had not done any photographs of all at all at that point. We were waiting on crime scene. So anything else that came through after that would presumably be crime scene that would have come and taken a look at the impressions, not us. You kind of get two issues. Two issues, first issue. Were those patterned shoe prints there the night before when you walked through? The only print there were the flat, smooth ones. I'm just trying, I'm not trying to belabor it. So those pattern prints came after you saw them the night before? Correct. The only impressions were the flat smooth ones. And you left and turned it over to Sled to process the scene? While we were there, again, that was at some point in time while we were there that evening. I didn't leave until like 10 o'clock the next morning. At some point in time that information was relayed so that they could photograph it. And I don't know whose prints those are. I would assume that they would have been agents that came down behind us and photographed or collected or did whatever. So we were talking about crime scene integrity earlier? Yes, sir. Those aren't your footprints, right? The ones that are, there is a set that would be myself and Detective Rutland's, but they're not going to cross over any of them. That's correct. The prints that cross over, they're not your prints? No, sir. If it cross over one of theirs, it's not mine. Okay. Who took this picture, do you know? I do not know. But it was taken, do you think, the next day? It was taken relatively soon afterwards because it still shows the smooth prints. So it was either taken upon daylight, because again, we didn't leave until like 10 o'clock. Right. So I don't actually know. So is this best practices to walk over evidence before you photograph it? Can't say that because it wasn't myself or my detective that did that. I'm just saying, you've been- If they were doing so while processing or while collecting, then inadvertently stepped on one, it's okay because they have other ones to use. But, you know, I'm sure that you would have to probably ask the person that stepped on them and took the photographs. If one of your detectives had done this, he would not be happy, correct? I wouldn't be happy, no, sir. Okay. Not unless it was done after it was processed and for a reason. Well, this is, these are the crime scene photographs taken by, we think, Swed or Swister Duffy Stone took some pictures the next day. Sure. One of, some agency other than yours, but certainly nobody ought to be walking across this stuff, right? No, again, like I said, they weren't like that when we were there, sir. Let me then go to one of the other pictures you were showing a moment ago. Oh, this water? Yes, sir. These pictures taken of the water, do you know when they were taken? I'm sorry. 189, 190. Do you know when they were taken? I know they were taken that evening, sir, but I'm not sure if you're looking at stills off of a body cam or an actual crime scene photograph. I don't know exactly when, but they were taken that evening, obviously. In this picture right here, water seems to be coming from the pen, right? From the dog pen? It appears so, yes, sir. And there's two full bottles, I mean, two full pails of water there for the dogs, right? In the picture, absolutely. Okay. And then there's some additional water in, and this is 189, that I'm not quite sure where that is, but that's consistent with the water you saw that night, right? The water that I saw that night, and it was captured very well on Sergeant Green's body-worn camera, came out of the first two kennels, traveled down a short distance, and then over to where, at the time, Paul's body was left. So the water that was around Paul came out of the kennels, correct? I don't know if that's where it came from, but it did come from that direction, and I did not see a hose or a jug or anything else, but it did tail from those first two kennels down to where Paul's body was. Okay. Let me, this is item under seal, 196. Okay. This was introduced to show what shoes she had on, right? Previously, yes. Yes, it was. Now, on the back of her leg, right here, did you, that night, look at that dirt? I did. Did you see a footwear impression, partial footwear impression, in that dirt? I saw what could very well be an impression. As if somebody put their foot on the back of her leg. It was something out of mud that very well could have been a shoe impression. On the back of her leg. On the back of her leg. As if they put their foot on the back of her leg. Do you know what analysis, if any, was done by SLED or any other law enforcement agency to determine if that was a shoe impression, and if so, what kind of shoe? Do you know? I do not know, sir. Okay. Thank you. You can turn the lights on, and I'll turn, how do I turn this on? So, let me ask you, I've got just a couple more questions. So, okay, so when you left that night for that early next morning, had you come to a conclusion as to any suspect? Had I come, no, sir. So, you're aware that the next day, the next morning, that your department issued a statement that said, at this time, there is no danger to the public. If information is received that dictates otherwise, we immediately notify the public. Are you aware of that? The Carlton County Sheriff's Office issued that. Carlton County Sheriff's Department, yes. I'm unaware, no, sir. Let me hand this article up to you. Post and courier. Judge, should I have received this or not? With anything, counsels referencing. Thank you. Thank you. Okay. Media article question posed was whether he was familiar with the statement made. He said no. Media article contains all sorts of information, not in the record. I haven't heard any exhibit being offered in the evidence. Post and courier story, June 8th, the next morning, 2021, which contains the quote, which I've just read. So was there a danger to the public the next morning? Were you afraid some serial killer was out there with a shotgun? AR type weapon. I can't effectively answer whether or not there's a danger to the public when I don't have all the pieces of the puzzle. I am fairly certain that statement wasn't issued by us, and the reason I can state that is because we were not primary, and it is a big no-no for us to issue anything when we're not the primary body. So where that information came from, I'm unaware, and it was never asked for me to approve dissent of the sheriff. It would have never came from us. If that statement had run, because it did, in the post and courier on the 8th, would the sheriff's department have pushed back on that and said that's not accurate? Could it be a subsequent story I haven't seen? I wouldn't have. I can't state that. The only thing I can tell you that when I left that morning, I didn't have any information that proved one thing or the other. So when you left that morning, was Alec Murdahl a suspect, killing his wife and son? When I left that morning, I wasn't the primary investigator. Who was? That would have been Sled. So you gave the whole case went to Sled? The whole case went to Sled. We were an assisting body at that time. And you were never consulted after that by Sled? I was not consulted in the sense that anything was provided to me. We have assisted. I have stored vehicles. I have stored property for them. I have stood by while they executed search warrants. But it was not in a manner in which the information or knowledge they had on the case was shared with me. It was the exact opposite. On the night of the murders, did your department obtain a search warrant? We did, sir. For all the property, the house, all of it? It was obtained for the entire 1,700-acre property. Including the house? Including the house. And was that executed? It was executed beginning at the Dole Kennels at the primary scene. But did you go to the house? I did not. Did your department? We did not. Who actually executed the search warrant? The search warrant was provided that evening to Crime Scene, which is standard protocol. When they come, they're going to ask for it. We have to show it. Sled's Crime Scene. It was given to them. And we stayed, myself and several of my detectives, several were sent home so they could come in the next morning. And we stayed and assisted. I didn't leave until 9 or 10 o'clock the next morning. Did you go in the residence? But no, sir. The drone footage that you saw was the last thing I did at that scene that morning. And then I left and went home. What about that night? Was the search warrant executed that night? After that, I had, after that incident there, or that search warrant was executed, I did come back later that day and did a walk around of the property that we've been discussing all afternoon. I have never been to the main house. Never been in it? I have not been in the main house. Not during this incident or any other incident. Did someone from your department go in the main house? Not that I'm aware of. It wouldn't have been, not as an investigator, let's put it that way. None of my detectives went over there under my direction. So, so, but, so you gave the search warrant to Sled, the crime safety? Yes, sir. That gave them the authority to go in the house, correct? It gave them, it was signed off on to cover the 1700 acres. Right, but I'm specifically talking about the residence. Any structure. Any structure. Any structure. They could have gone in the residence. They could have. Look, taken all his clothes to check if they wanted, right? They could have. I don't know that they didn't. Well, I, well, we're going to talk about that later on. They could have, you're familiar with trace evidence on many, many cases where they check showers or sinks to see if there's a trace evidence of blood, right? Am I? Yes, sir. Yes. And do you know whether they did that or not? I do not. Again. I know that you can, with the appropriate technology, use, look at microscopic evidence, see whether it be blood or tissue, or if somebody tried to wash something, you can actually still, in a washed piece of clothing, detect blood or detect tissue, even after it's been washed. Do you wear that? Am I aware of that? Yes, I am. Do you know whether Sled did that? I do not. Again. But they could have, at night, done all of those things under that search warrant. Presumably so. And I'm not saying they didn't. Again, Mr. Orville. But they could have. I'm not saying they didn't either. We're going to find out. Sure. But under the search warrant, your department obtained, they had the authority to go in the house, any of the buildings, anywhere on that property, and look for guns, evidence of any sort of crime. Evidence of, again, in the shower, in the sinks, trace evidence. They had the authority to do that. To answer your question, as long as they stayed within the scope of the actual warrant that was signed, I don't have that search warrant, and Detective Rutland is the one that actually got it. If they stay within the scope of that search warrant, and they're only searching inside that scope, they had the ability to search structures, vehicles, only 1,700 acres, as long as they're within the scope. Well, I believe we'll hear from Detective Rutland tomorrow. Yes, sir. And I'll ask her these questions. Thank you, sir. Having said that, Your Honor, I have no further questions. Any redirects? No. Captain Chapman, the footsteps that you noticed, I know we've been through quite a bit of it, but counsel raised this issue. The path you followed, were they consistent with someone who, with a person who started back beyond this area, and then where did they go from there? I'm asking where they went. Where did they originate, where did they go to, and where did they end? That's not the question. The objection is sustained as to the form of the question. Thank you. If you could please explain to us where in your estimation, having traced the tracks, where they originated from, where they ultimately went to, and where they ended up? The shoe impressions crossed completely from one side all the way to the other, with the building to the right going down, coming back the opposite direction. The only reason I can say that we're fairly certain that it started from the grass side and went through, turned around and came back, is because we never saw any impressions similar to that running beyond the airport hangar on the backside. In the location, in reference to where these footprints ended, ultimately, and where Maggie's body is located, how did that line up, describe how they lined up? If you take a step back from there to the right of that image would have been on the opposite side of the hangar door, would have been Maggie's body. I'm referencing State's Exhibit 190. Captain Chapman, do you notice blood marks here in the water? Objection, Your Honor. The objection is sustained. Did you observe blood marks in the water when you were there that evening? Calling for speculation. He is calling for speculation as to what discoloration in the water, if there is any, is caused by. I'll lay more of a foundation, Your Honor. Captain Chapman, were you familiar with the scene as this picture depicts? Yes. Did you personally view what this picture depicts? I did. Are you familiar with the discoloration, and did you observe the discoloration in this photograph on two different areas? I did see that. Was that discoloration, in your opinion, consistent? Objection. He's not been qualified to give an opinion about this matter. I didn't hear the complete question. In your estimation, in your opinion? Your Honor, objection, and if he's going to pursue this frivolous line of questioning, I'd ask the jury be excused. If no evidence whatsoever. The objection is on the roof. Let's pause the question. In your experience and observation, having observed the scene and all the matter that was there, were those lines in the water consistent with blood? Objection. The objection is sustained. Thank you. I don't need to be thanked for any ruling. I'm sorry, Your Honor, expressing my gratitude is improper. I appreciate that. Thank you, Your Honor. Just one last question, and I understand the court's ruling. Captain Chapman, are the substance there that you identified as having observed, are they in a straight line? Are they in straight lines? Yes. Thank you. I'd like to strike his questions about blood from the record and the jury be instructed to disregard those questions. I've informed the jury that they are to disregard any question when I sustain the objection. They were previously instructed on that. Yes, thanks. Yes. Any further cross-examination? Thank you, sir. You may step down. If you'll turn the lights up, please. Ladies and gentlemen, we've come to the end of this day. Thank you all very much. We'll resume at 930 tomorrow morning. Have a good evening. Please remember you're not to discuss the case with anyone or allow anyone to discuss it in your presence, nor are you to engage in any or be exposed to any other information other than what you have received in the courtroom and will receive in the courtroom. Have a good evening. Thank you. We're in recess until 930 tomorrow morning. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 32426\n","\n","Link  156 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/elRRxMbx3Cw\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/elRRxMbx3Cw\n","[youtube] elRRxMbx3Cw: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] elRRxMbx3Cw: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 4.27MiB in 01:19\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  For more on this, we're joined now by retired NYPD inspector and attorney Paul Morrow. Paul, you did an amazing job last night on our air with our friend Jesse Waters. It's sort of in real time reacting to the video as it was released last night on Waters' prime time. Now you've had some time to reflect. What are your thoughts this morning? Well, I think very clearly the tactics were way over the top. Everybody is in agreement upon that. You know, I think we're in the stage now where we have to start to assess the reaction. And one of the things I think is worth bringing up is that we have to look larger than just the five officers who have been fired and charged. And I think you have to go all the way to the top. At this point, you have to start to say, is there something intrinsic to the Memphis PD? And that's not an aspersion on the men and women of Memphis PD that are out there every day. I'm talking more bureaucratically. Because police departments generally take on the persona and atmospherics of their overhead right up to the top of the chain. And at this point, the fact that the police chief seems to be triangulating against these five officers without ever taking any responsibility by saying, look, the buck stops with me. We have to do an assessment here. We have to look at the supervision. We have to look at our training. I'm not hearing that. And I think many of us in the police world would like to hear something more than I'm very upset from the very top of the food chain down there in the Memphis PD. That's a very interesting point you're making, Paul. And of course, we have heard that it was obviously a good move on behalf of authorities there from Chief Davis to Mayor Strickland in the DA trying to get out there. These officers were charged, fired and charged way earlier in previous cases, as we saw was the case in, say, Ferguson or Baltimore or Minneapolis. But specifically to your point about going larger than these five officers, is it your view then that this wasn't just five rogue officers? This is perhaps larger, more pattern or policy based? I mean, it's possible. And I'll tell you why I sort of come to that is the fact that there are five of them together, right? This is a specialized unit, Scorpion unit. Generally, these specialized units are very heavily supervised because it's recognized in police practice that they're sort of the point of the spear. NYPD has had units like this as well and still does. And they're very heavily supervised. So five of them together, I don't know if that was their practice, but that's a lot of cops in one place for a specialized unit without a sergeant being nearby. Takes a while from what I see for any supervision to arrive. And you know, you have to say that it does seem like they felt very free to react the way they did. And you have to say to yourself, has this happened in the past? Why did it go the way they went? And you know, I think you do have to look a little bit larger. They clearly had little regard for knowing they were on camera, multiple cameras there in the number of things that they cross the line on in the video we see. I want to ask you, though, before I run out of time, so where does this go? We know the DOJ is launching an investigation. Where are we headed? Yeah. So unusually, DOJ now has announced a, looks like they're announcing a parallel investigation that is going to run contemporaneous here with the investigation going on at the state level. I view that as a complication at this point. Generally, the DOJ investigations come along as a follow on. And the problem with that is that what the DOJ investigations generally default to is a federal monitorship, which means that a law firm is put in charge of keeping an eye on the police department and reforming it. And those monitorships never go away. And the law firm gets rich. There's nothing like municipal money. Those checks come in regularly. They'll charge $500, $600, $700 an hour, even after their job is kind of done. I mean, you know, I'm not pointing to anybody specifically, but I just know how this goes. And I'm not sure at this point, so early in the game, it's necessarily helpful for DOJ to be poking at this, particularly the civil rights division. They have an investigation going on. These guys are criminally charged. Let it play out. Let it play out. We shall see where it goes. Paul Morrow, thank you for your insight and joining us today. Thank you. I'm Steve Ducey.

They wanted to get to the bottom of what was going on and help the folks where it's needed. The general kind enough to join us. General, obviously you have probably a lot of jet lag and we appreciate you sharing your journey with us. What can you tell us? What did you learn? Yeah, Neil, thanks for having me this morning. Bottom line, Ukrainians want to fight. They don't want U.S. troops. They don't want NATO troops. All they want is equipment and they're going to fight this to the end. It's very clear to them that this is a very aggressive Russia move. It's targeted on civilians. It's targeted on infrastructure. We went out pretty far to the Northeast and we saw some absolute incredible destruction out there by the Russians. It was targeted on infrastructure. It was targeted on hospitals. It was targeted on schools. In fact, the mayor of Kiev told us later that this is genocide. And I think when we look at what's going to happen over there, I believe it's very important we get them the equipment to fight because I think now we're right on the cusp. I think it's going to come out probably in just a couple of months when we get into the spring and the summer and then into the fall. This is going to be a fight to the end. Ukraine is not going to negotiate. They have no intention to negotiate. They want to eject Russian forces from Ukraine. I don't care if it's a Donbass. I don't care if it's Crimea. And they're committed to it. I've talked to a lot of government officials, military officials, civilians that are out there. It's a very committed nation. If anybody doubts their loyalty to Ukraine, they're badly mistaken. And again, as I said, I think it's a fight to the finish. You've been right along the way here. And generally, the only thing is if they're adamant about not giving up an inch of land or letting the Russians have an inch of land, Vladimir Putin is equally adamant about unleashing holy hell on civilians. He's not going anywhere. What's the end game here? Yeah, here's what I think the end game is, Neil. I think evicting the Russians from Ukraine, I think they've got the capacity to do it, the Ukrainians, with their fighting spirit. It's not only giving them the kid, because I think they've got the Russians at least at a stalemate and possibly on their heels. And I think why this is important geostrategically, if we can, if the Ukrainians can defeat Russia in the field and eject them from the Donbass or Crimea, Putin falls. And it changes Europe for a generation to come. People need to realize Ukraine is the second largest country in Europe. I saw that just driving it. And they're very committed to freedom and democracy. They recognize they've got some issues with things that have happened in the past, with illegal activities going on. They understand that. They're trying to correct it. But, boy, I'll tell you, their military is a fighting military. I saw it firsthand. We got pretty darn close to the area where what they call the zero line is, which is what we used to call the line of contact. And there's no doubt in my mind that they're committed to this fight and fight to the end. So one of these two sides is going to win. I don't think there's going to be anything to negotiate. I don't think there's going to be any negotiations, despite what people want to talk about. Zelensky's not going to do it, and neither is Putin. We don't have a lot of time, gentlemen, but I'd like to get your thoughts on something else that Vladimir Putin had said, that we crossed a red line. That is, us, the United States, and by extension, Germany, by providing tanks, Abrams tanks on our parts, and obviously these advanced tanks that the Germans are providing. That was a red line. What did he mean by that, and what is he threatening? Well, I don't know what he means by it, but he's the one who crossed the red line. He is the one who invaded Ukraine. Ukraine did not invade Russia. And when he talks about it, he's trying to intimidate the alliance in the United States as well. But because they crossed the red line, he keeps talking about it. He's kind of shifting the red line. And I think he's trying to get us afraid of his nuclear option. I wouldn't be afraid of that at all. I think we're in a good position to push back on him. I think Ukraine's in a good position to put back on him. But his talk is all bluster right now. He knows he's got a major problem. He's on his fifth military commander right now in Ukraine, with Gerasimov filling in now as a senior four-star fighting for the Russians there. And his military's been badly damaged. I think the estimates are around 150,000 killed and blood on the wounded out there. And he's fighting in human waves right now. He's gone back to a traditional way the Russians fight, which has a lot of use for artillery and mass-wave attacks. It's crazy, General. You're a top brave man. You are. Thank you for this, and thank you for your service to this country. General Keith Kellogg on all of that.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 942\n","\n","Link  158 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/8pFY4GMrU_4\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/8pFY4GMrU_4\n","[youtube] 8pFY4GMrU_4: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 8pFY4GMrU_4: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 11.04MiB in 02:34\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  All right. All right. It's me, Tom Shalhou. Let's welcome tonight's guests. She put herself through college running moonshine, co-host of the bottom line on Fox Business, Dagan McDowell. He rides a bike and he's from Philadelphia, yet somehow he's still alive. CEO of Electric Bike Technologies, Jason Kraft. She's an expert on politics, which for this show makes her unique. Fox News correspondent, Gillian Turner. By night, she's a popular TV personality. By day, she's a professional dog walker. Fox News contributor, Kat Timp. Well, it's been a minute since we cleaned out the fridge, so before we get to some new stories, let's do this. Greg's Leftovers. Yeah, it's Leftovers where I read some recent jokes we didn't use. And just like when Greg does it, it's my first time reading these. Here we go. During a recent jail interview, Jelaine Maxwell claimed Jeffrey Epstein was indeed murdered in his cell. She says she knows this because he never really liked to hang by himself. All right. Jeff Bezos' girlfriend, Lauren Sanchez, revealed in an interview that in 1999, she was devastated after finding out that she didn't land a job as one of the co-hosts of The View. But TV industry experts say it's likely she didn't meet the show's minimum weight requirement. Wait a minute. I don't know if I would have okayed that one. President Biden is rolling out a renter's bill of rights. The press says he was deeply moved after hearing about a drug addict who lived with his parents in Delaware, yet still paid 50 grand a month in rent. At least $20 stores in Detroit have been robbed this month. Police have asked the public to keep an eye out for a criminal who lacks ambition. Go on. A Denver area public library is investigating traces of methamphetamine found in their restrooms. It's a sad thought to think of drugs in a library, although it does explain the success of their speed reading program. Because of rampant crime, Nike has chosen to permanently shut down its flagship store in downtown Seattle. And in a related story, Nike is also introducing a brand new slogan, just give up. Tech mogul named Brian Johnson, who's 45 years old, says he spends $2 million a year to have the body of an 18-year-old. But we found a picture and it's not working. That's an ACDC joke. Okay. Take a dig into it. Former President Barack Obama refused to say this week whether or not he's searching for classified documents in his home. So I'm pretty sure it was Barack Obama who once said, if you like your classified documents, you can keep your classified documents. According to NASA, 2022 was the fifth hottest year in history. In fact, it was so hot, three New York City cab drivers actually flirted with the idea of turning the air conditioning on. All right. It's a local joke. First Grace cryptocurrency mogul Sam Bankman Freed has reportedly enlisted the services of a 75-pound dog trained to attack on command using a secret code word. Let me guess, pudding? And finally, under Biden's art dealer, Jorge Berges has claimed that Biden will be among the most consequential artists in this century because his art gives us hope. Yes, it really does. We hope he quits painting real soon. All right. All right. Okay, now to some news. Will labeling social media defective prove effective? Plaintiffs are expected to file a lawsuit next month against Metta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, for the alleged damages they've done to America's mental health. The case hinges on a legal theory that algorithms are defective products that encourage addictive behavior and are governed by existing product liability law. However, legal experts say the law traditionally applies to tangible stuff like a car or a toaster and in some cases, a presidency. The lawsuit argues social media giants knew their algorithms encouraged users to view mentally harmful posts that cause eating disorders, anxiety, and depression. Coincidentally, the same symptoms you get for working for Greg Gutfeldt. So that's the deal. Jillian, do you believe this? Obviously, social media, it's got its problems, but can you sue? Yes, you can sue because a whole slew of states are now suing various social media platforms. There's been this effort across the government to ban various platforms on government devices. I will also say for somebody who wants to be sensitive to the issues of the daytime, you had a lot of fat jokes. I know. I didn't. I'm trying to decide how I feel about that. Yeah. I mean, look, it's what you got to do whatever the writers tell you on this show, apparently. Another word about this lawsuit, if I may. They are not just accusing these social media companies of encouraging addictive behavior. Remember, these platforms, by design, according to their own founders, are literally created in order to perpetuate addiction. The algorithms are all geared towards instigating more clicks as addictive behavior. They've admitted it. Don't they do that? Jason, I think Zuckerberg at Metta, he's bragged about it when he goes to advertisers. He says, we've cracked the code. People are addicted to our platforms. Yeah, it's true. I don't think you should ban anything, though. Not any American company. Stop banning things. Why don't you ban parents who don't take care of their kids? Get some personal responsibility. It's not Facebook's fault you let your kid hang out on there all the time or something like that, right? Yeah. What do you think about there's a lot of people trying to ban TikTok. They say, oh, that's China. Well, that's why I said American. Should you single them out because of China? That's why I said American. I use WeChat a lot. I do business in China. I always know. I always know they're watching. I make electric bikes. No, I know. I'm joking. Oh. She was giving you a plug, Jason. Everyone's like, is he the guy from the Gilmore Girls? That was your moment. You missed it. Thank you. It's true. Kat, do you think this could be a successful lawsuit? No. Look, I think it's dumb. So that would be my legal ruling. It's dumb to sue. Well, no, because I'm one of those people that doesn't think guns kill people, people kill people. So I also think that if social media makes you feel bad about yourself from looking at social media, it's the people that make you feel bad about yourself from looking at social media. Because everybody looks the best on social media. You never look like that. I mean, I can totally admit that. When I post a picture of myself on Instagram, by the time you look at it, I don't look like that anymore. I look like Beth from Little Women, right before the scarlet fever takes her. But except with less hair. So you just have to acknowledge that. I try to be transparent, say I wear a lot of hair extensions, I have a lot of makeup on. This is me with bronzer, believe it or not. And you have to kind of acknowledge that because it can make you feel bad. But if you're so like, social media makes you feel bad. And wait till I tell you about people. It's so true. Dagan, it's personal responsibility, right? People have to know at this point that these things aren't good for you. And you've got to regulate, you've got to self-regulate. Well the people are defective before they ever go on the social media. And I say that as a person with major defects. I am the Ford Pinto of the McDowell family. You smack me on the ass, I explode. Like the talk and the gram and the twit, they will make your crazy worse. Because you go online, and Kat's a testament to this, you go online for positive reinforcement and reassurance from people who are equally batwing bananas. Like oh everybody loves my new Madonna look. My shaved eyebrows and my big puffed up souffle mouth and my hairline that starts somewhere back behind my ears. Everybody just thinks I'm awesome. But then again, in reverse, it can maybe take away some of the nuttiness when maybe everybody realizes that Madonna with her big puffed up souffle mouth, can I walk on the scene because she can't move her mouth. So maybe it has a positive effect on the real world. But what if you're like eight, right? None of us, we're all really young on this show today, but none of us are young enough to have grown up on these apps, right? Like what if you start looking at this stuff when you're like a kid? Imagine how crazy you're going to be when you're an adult. Well we need to burn their parents. Burn them? Well, not literally. You mean expose them, expose the parents. Well it's interesting, Gilliam, when Snapchat first came out, because the snaps disappeared, everyone said this is really nasty because people are going to use it to sext each other. But then they found out that actually Snapchat users had a healthier relationship because the things disappear. And on Instagram, a lot of especially young girls, they get obsessed with the image, whether it gets liked or not because it stays there, it's permanent. So the permanence was causing more insecurity. Does that make sense to you? I mean, I can only imagine that it does. Like Dejan said, if you're like... That's some made up research you just called for. That's what we're into on this show. You just made that up. You don't believe that? Not even burn like Salem witch trials. I meant, but who thinks that it's okay an eight year old is on social media? Yeah, no, I don't think it's good. I think a lot of them are. I'm doing the invasion of the body snatchers point and screech at any parent who is letting their small children on social... By the way, kids don't like Facebook. Like Facebook's the most uncool thing for kids. It's like LinkedIn. I have three kids. They're like, Facebook? Yeah, that's for old people, right? Yeah, we don't have to worry about the kids on Facebook. Other stuff maybe, but... In fact, I think this thing could be, this is the kind of lawsuit that I think Democrats like because they don't want us looking into the real thing that Facebook did was affect the last election because they were taking down any posts that were favorable to Republicans and boosting anything that were favorable to Democrats. Am I right about that audience? Yeah. Yeah. I know where to go at the end of the segment.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1814\n","\n","Link  159 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/Fn1zMGdkM0w\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fn1zMGdkM0w\n","[youtube] Fn1zMGdkM0w: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] Fn1zMGdkM0w: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 2.45MiB in 00:36\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Hi, everyone. Welcome to One Nation. I'm Brian Kilmeade. We start tonight with a Fox News alert. Within the last 24 hours, the Memphis Police Department released body cam footage of the police-involved death of Tyree Nichols. We were warned before the release that this video would be heinous, would be savage. It is. Everything they prepared us for, true. Just beyond anything I've ever seen. In the first, you see, body cam video, you see an officer approach Tyree Nichols with their guns drawn and aggressively yank him out of his vehicle. Officers throw Nichols to the ground, yelling at him repeatedly, get to the ground. He was on the ground, put his hands behind his back. He did that. A few moments later, you see Nichols get up and run. They tase him, he takes off his shirt, runs away. When officers do catch up to him, they restrain him on the ground. Multiple officers repeatedly punch him and pepper spray him. At one point, you see an officer walk up and kick Nichols in the head at least two times. The officers then proceed to basically pass him around, again punching him in the face, striking him with a baton, over and over again, before he collapses, later dragged and propped up against a police car. It doesn't look conscious to me. It's given no medical attention, even though there was medical experts there. Nichols would die a few days later in the hospital. He was 29 years old with no criminal record. So far, the reaction to this video has been outrageous, but it has been an outrage, but it has not been outrageous. People in Memphis and across the country are protesting, but there is no widespread violence, but fear of it does remain. An almost universal agreement that this is unacceptable. Now, the five officers, well, they're black. They're all members of an elite unit that requires specific qualifications and training. The Scorpion unit, it's an acronym. It's a unit that's been inactive now since Nichols has passed away on January 5th. The police officers have been fired, charged with second degree murder, all are out in bail except one. They will face trial, they will face punishment, and eventually, if they're found guilty, and eventually tell their side of the story. But for now, we're all set to wonder how in the world this could happen.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 403\n","\n","Link  160 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/Fm0w7tf0HXA\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/Fm0w7tf0HXA\n","[youtube] Fm0w7tf0HXA: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] Fm0w7tf0HXA: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 508.27KiB in 00:06\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Biden defied all the odds when he was elected a U.S. senator at 29, but to him, it didn't get any easier from there.

A ban on Adam Schiff while a pundit swings and whiffs. Matt Gaetz has introduced the pencil resolution to bar congressman and, look, I knew that would get it, and U.S. Senate candidate Adam Schiff from Accessing Classified Information. PENCIL stands for Preventing Extreme Negligence with Classified Information Licenses. The resolution aims to bar Schiff from getting his hands on classified docs and calls for a house ethics investigation into him, stemming from his role in the Trump-Russia collusion hoax, a theory with bigger holes in it than Hunter's Biden septum. But of course, pencil also cleverly refers to Schiff's skinny neck. Can I make skinny neck jokes? Cat? I don't know if I can. Physician, heal thyself. I haven't seen a troll that good since Stelter left CNN. Speaking of trolls, Washington Post columnist Jennifer Rubin, she recently wrote an op-ed slamming America's governor Ron DeSantis, calling him a full-blown white supremacist, banning the College Board's Advanced Placement for African American Studies course from Florida schools. Wait, they're already calling Ron DeSantis a white supremacist? I didn't see that coming until at least May. She's referring to the Sunshine State's Education Department rejection of the Advanced Placement African American Studies class due to its focus on black queer studies. Then again, if I worked for the Washington Post, I wouldn't like reading either. Many consider DeSantis a front-runner in the 2024 presidential election, so we want to get Joe's take on it. Hey, I hope these guys get together and get things done. Work together, cross the aisle. I like them all. I don't really like those Florida guys too much. I like Schiff. California? Yeah, I'm from Calif- no, I'm from- I know where I'm from! I'm aware. I'm Delaware. I got it! That's how I remember it! I deserve an ice cream for that. He does! Let him have an ice cream. Kat, you told me in the green room that you wish you married Adam Schiff instead of your husband. You told me that too, actually, to be fair. Ew. What do you think of this here? First of all, what do you think of Gates' clever little thing? Will it pass? Clever little thing. Yeah, I think, I mean, obviously it is a trolling thing, right? It's to get attention and people talk about it, so in that sense, it absolutely did work. But also, yeah, Adam Schiff, that's government, right? You can be really bad at something over and over and over again and still keep your job. And only in the government can you kind of do that, so I mean, there's many reasons why you shouldn't have access to classified information, but also everybody apparently just has classified information hanging out in their house. There's also, I think, a problem with over-classification of documents. So basically, I just take the uplifting view that it's just all so hopeless. That's the best way to go, I think, Kat. Dagan, the Schiff is, I mean, we make fun of Schiff on the show all the time. It's hard for people to take him seriously, but when you talk to Democrats, especially kind of left-wing Democrats from California, they really like the guy, he was endlessly on Donald Trump, and Donald Trump makes them crazy. So what do you think of his future? He's running for the Senate now. Do you think that Schiff is maybe not as silly as we think he is in terms of Democratic politics? Oh, no, he's irretrievably stupid, too, because he was using Chinese spyware, which has been banned on government devices just a few weeks ago, to bemoan getting kicked off an intelligence community, proving to the American people that he should be kicked off the intelligence community, because he doesn't know he's using Chinese spyware that's been banned on government devices. I digress. I love the pencil insult, though. Yeah, Gates is good. Not just for him, but just in general, pencil neck... Uh... Um, no man likes being called pencil skinny. Like, every dude would want to have a little bit of peck, a little bit of bicep, something. They don't want to be that thin. And also, it's just not, you look like a pencil and you smell like one, too, because the eraser is kind of funky smelling. Like, just the idea of, like, what does a pencil eraser smell like? And then pencil shavings, what do pencil shavings smell like? Vauban. You remember vauban? It's the powder that they use in schools to clean up vomit. Oh, my God. I remember that stuff. Pencil shavings smell like vauban. How weird is it that in school, people were just vomiting all the time? They were. And then there was always somebody at Freddy with some vauban to just... It's like sawdust, right? Yeah. Can you blame the vauban, though? If someone threw up here at work just even one time, they'd talk about it forever, but in school, it's like, ah, again. It did happen a lot. Again, you call somebody, you know, a pencil, from here on out, mark my words, you're gonna think about vauban. Yeah, so true. Jason, the, uh, I think that Matt Gaetz might have been... I don't want to, you know, give credit where credit is due, but maybe he was on the phone with somebody who gave him that idea for the pencil legislation. What do you think? Do you know who I'm talking about, Jason? I think I know who I'm talking about. I'm thinking about that guy. I'm thinking about that guy. I'm thinking about that guy somewhere. Yeah, the pencil thing's an easy one on this guy, but I got to tell you, well, I'm thinking about that time at the Franklin Institute that I puked on the floor right now, but Hawaiian Punch, warm day. Who hasn't? That's why you go to the Franklin Institute, right? This guy's shift makes me want to puke. Like, not many people make my skin crawl. But how did we elect these people? And Gaetz has his own problems. He is a little bit weirdo. Why are you bringing the porn stepdad? Right? I took the suit off. You got to get away from that one. But, Jillian, in a political sense, he's running for Senate now. He wants to be the senator from California. He is a congressman right now. Correct. Do you think, you know, I think he has a good shot, because I do think that the left kind of likes this guy. First of all, I don't know if we can get through the segment without at least mentioning that Matt Gaetz has some issues to work out. So let's just start with that. However, I will also say, his whole rationale for not wanting Schiff to serve on the Intel committee is that he says Schiff got it dead wrong, right, with the Trump-Russia collusion narrative. Fine. But if the bar for seating members of Congress on committees was that they could never have been dead wrong about something, we would literally have no committees in Washington. So it's a little bit of a slippery slope to go down. Yeah. I want to start from a political standpoint. I would think, you know, if I were McCarthy, I would let these guys, including Swalwell, on these committees, because you always see these hearings, and because they were in the minority, they didn't have a chance to challenge these guys. But now that they're running the committees, go ahead, you know, let Adam Schiff get up there, and then when he says a Russia collusion, you can say, you've got to give me the goods now, because we're running the committee. What do you think of that, Kat? I mean, I think you can try, but I think he had... Think about how long of a time he spent being able to talk about it when he also really had nothing. I don't know that it would be that simple or go that way. Swalwell is not the talking, it was the schtupen of a Chinese spy that was the problem. Yeah, that usually does you in when you're... Isn't it politics? Yeah, like sticking it in a spa. I get it, I get it, Dagan.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1406\n","\n","Link  162 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/eujZ7kk9reA\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/eujZ7kk9reA\n","[youtube] eujZ7kk9reA: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] eujZ7kk9reA: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 5.10MiB in 01:18\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Joining us now, Pat Ryder, Nassau County Police Commissioner and Randy Sutton, retired police lieutenant with the Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department and the founder of the Wounded Blue. Okay, Commissioner, this video is brutal. There's been a conversation about why release it tonight on a Friday night. There has been a buildup. We've been warned about how bad it was. And those of us who have watched it now know, unfortunately, that accurate, the description was very accurate. It seems so far tonight that people are peacefully protesting. But what do you make of the timing of this release and how it's playing out? Well, there's a lot that goes on behind the scenes that the world doesn't get to see. Chief Davis and her team down in Memphis did a great job. They briefed us three times this week. All the law enforcement agencies around the country, major city chiefs, got a briefing from the chief and her team, giving us the heads up so we can prepare, as she was also preparing for possible unrest in our community. So the timing of it, it's a difficult choice. You know, nobody can pick the right time. There's never a right time to give bad news to anybody. But Chief Davis and her team did a good job getting it out tonight. And as you can see so far, everybody is staying calm. The messages got out in front, and we'll see how the rest of the weekend goes. Randy, you and I have had this conversation, unfortunately, because there have been other cases like this, and we fear there will be cases like this in the future. But we've talked about, my late father was a law enforcement officer. There's nobody who hates a bad cop worse than a good cop, because this now colors the ability for everybody to get out there safely and do their jobs. When you've got a community, when you've got people who have been hurt, who are wary of you and don't want to cooperate with police, how much bad has this case done for the good men and women in uniform? Well, you've hit a very important point. And, you know, what we have seen here is another watershed moment, I'm afraid, in law enforcement. Rodney King was a watershed moment, George Floyd. And now we have this debacle in Memphis. As a police trainer, I spent many, many years as a trainer watching what unfolded here in Memphis was actually shocking to me. I saw horrible policing. I saw bad techniques. I saw out-of-control officers, no supervision, no leadership. And this is a recipe for what just took place. There was just, there was just, it was a feeding frenzy. And it was it was policing at its worst. Now, I can tell you this, that from my sources in Memphis, the rank and file realized that these individuals went way, way overboard, and they support the actions of the chief. And that doesn't always happen. So, I'm proud of the Memphis officers recognizing this misconduct. But there's a lot of other issues here, Shannon, that we can go into, reference their training, reference hiring, reference—you know, there's a—an investigation needs to take place into the hiring practices that were taking place when these—none of these cops have more than two or three years on. So, you know, if they're all hired about the same time, and you have a—it's a symptom. So, it really needs to be addressed. And that's something down the road that the Memphis police leadership needs to take a look at. Yeah. And there are a number of investigations, state and federal, that will dig into these issues and clearly make suggestions about what should come next. I want to play what Benjamin Crump, the attorney for the Nichols family, said about race and police culture. Here's his take. Racism and bias. It is the institutionalized police culture. It's not just the police culture. It's the justice system. You don't see officers doing this to white citizens, because our court system has said that they value white life more than any other life. Now, against that backdrop, I thought it was interesting that the police chief there in Memphis, C.J. Davis, said she thinks this actually is not an issue of race. What she said is it's about human dignity, integrity, and accountability, and the duty to protect our community. Commissioner, what do you make of that part of the conversation? Well, they want to make it about race, but the truth of the matter is, our job is to protect and serve all the people, no matter your race, religion, your gender. We're out there to serve the public. These five officers, they threw that out the window today. They decided that they were going to go above and be better than the law. And what they did in the attack on Mr. Tyree there is way above the training, muscle memory, practice how you play. Everything went out the window. They let their emotions take over, and then they tarnished the shield. They ruined the reputation of all the good men and women out there in law enforcement that work hard every single day and go out there and take the risk. It's hard enough to retain. It's hard enough to recruit. And now it makes it even more difficult. That's why we need the support of our local politicians like we do here in Nassau County. Yeah, for the good folks that are out there in uniform trying to serve the community. Commissioner Randy, we thank you both very much.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 948\n","\n","Link  163 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/oAXdbK1DI30\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/oAXdbK1DI30\n","[youtube] oAXdbK1DI30: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] oAXdbK1DI30: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 1.87MiB in 00:29\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  This is a Fox News alert protesters marching in cities across the country. After tonight's release of that body cam footage of the arrest and beating of 29 year old Tyree Nichols, he died three days later. Five former Memphis police officers are facing charges of second degree murder, kidnapping and assault. Let's go back now to Memphis where Fox News senior correspondent Steve Harrigan has been standing by tonight. Sounds like so far, so good, Steve. Shannon, about three or four hundred protesters managed to block a section of Interstate 55 for about three hours. Police really just let them take control of that section of highway and chant for a few hours. That crowd has pretty much melted away. You can see the downtown area functioning normally here. There were real concerns that that tape could spark violence here in Memphis. So far, it simply has not happened. A number of merchants boarded up their windows, but there have been no reports of violence, no reports of injuries. There are also real concerns that releasing that tape of violence on a Friday night could play into protesters hands. Officials were worried about school children being disturbed if it was in the middle of the week. So far, that bet seems to have paid off a quiet Friday night here on the most part, in part because the government seems to have acted really swiftly. They're getting praise both from the family and from the family's attorneys saying on the one hand, they fired the police officers, they arrested them, they charged all five with murder, both the family and their attorneys basically saying this was a good first step so far. We're going to need to seek convictions. But that fear of widespread and serious violence here has not materialized. Shannon, back to you. Steve, thank you. So glad to hear that so far.

So tonight we begin in Memphis with the disturbing footage of five black police officers beating Tyree Nichols to death. But before he was a victim, Tyree was a father. Tyree loved skateboarding. He was an artist, a photographer who loved capturing the sunset. His mother said he was on his way home from taking pictures of the sky on the night of January the 7th. He called for his mother just hours later. Watch out, watch out! Mom! Mom! So according to one friend, the 29-year-old wanted to be a police officer himself. Now I've been inundated by folks asking for my take, my opinion, but this goes so far beyond just one point of view. Law enforcement officers in Tennessee and across the country, frankly, are absolutely appalled by the countless policies these former officers ignored. They were members of the now disbanded elite unit, but they broke basic safety protocols. It just makes you question what happened before the cameras started rolling because they arrived at the scene totally out of control. Calls are going louder for better police training, and yes, there is a need for that, but these men failed in simple policing one-on-one. I'm not sure training would help them here. They've dishonored their badge, and while they face punishment for their crimes, it's their fellow officers who will face the fallout. Now we know there are still conversations still to be had, because at its core, what happened to Tyree isn't a cop issue. It's a humanity issue. His life had zero value to them, and there is a racial component, even if both the victim and perpetrator of this heinous crime are black. And despite what you may hear from the liberal media, it's not about white supremacy. We can't ignore the complicated relationship between cops and black America, but these cops were black and blue. They were supposed to bridge the gap. Instead, they further strained an already fractured relationship. The death of Tyree Nichols will fuel more rage, more cops leaving the job, more hateful rhetoric, if we let it. But I implore you, America, there is a silver lining here. If we choose to look for it, justice worked, our system worked, if we trust in it, these officers were fired and charged immediately. There was no doubt, no hesitation, and we should applaud that swift action. What we can't control is how these disgraceful officers have hurt the American family. But it's up to us to decide how we react. It is up to us to decide how we heal. We'll do that tonight.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 439\n","\n","Link  166 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/o4k9jX6zBOo\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/o4k9jX6zBOo\n","[youtube] o4k9jX6zBOo: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] o4k9jX6zBOo: Downloading webpage\n"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["ERROR: unable to download video data: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden\n"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Skipped 166\n","\n","\n","Link  167 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/hvPiq2Flwks\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/hvPiq2Flwks\n","[youtube] hvPiq2Flwks: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] hvPiq2Flwks: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 6.73MiB in 01:31\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  The video was violent and disturbing the protest anything but what to make of the fallout of the release of disturbing images that show the eventual beating and death of Tyree Nichols. We've got Alveda King with us right now. The niece of Martin Luther King, the daughter of A.D. King, the civil rights activist kind enough to join us. Alveda, I was thinking of you and thinking of your uncle Martin Luther King, of course, assassinated in Memphis in 1968. So we're sensitive. That area is sensitive to issues like this, particularly issues like this. But they handled it calmly and retrospectively a lot goes back to the mother who somehow was able to urge protesters think peacefully, act rightfully, but think peacefully. What do you think? When you think of the heart of that precious mother who's calling for peace in the midst of that grief, I'm very familiar with that. My uncle was killed, my dad, my grandmother, of course, and it's very difficult. So first it's important to have that relationship with God. But you can be comforted and get comfort others. And so our hearts and prayers are to Tyree's family. Now, this is very important. I'm going to say it, Neil, you have to really think about it. You and I have had this discussion and we always said that it wasn't about racism and skin color. Most of the time, even though that issue could be there, this is not because these officers were African American men, the victim. Well, not victim, the suspect. Let me be clear with my language. Also African American. But what we have when we have a shoot first, ask question later mentality, whether that be with military or with law enforcement or in any situation, we have to step back and think. Martin Luther King Jr. Talked about man's inhumanity to man. We may not think about the fact, even in these situations, that we are dealing with human beings that have families that have parents, might be parents, all of this. The officers themselves sometimes are endangered themselves when they go out to do their job. So I'm calling for peace. I'm joining the mother. Let's be peaceful. Let's be prayerful and take a real examination of what's happening with this escalated violence, the pepper spray, the violence with him on the ground. Oh, my God, my heart was broken. And I want to remember that myself that we're one blood, one human race. There can be man's inhumanity to man, whether we are women, children, men, women, any of that. So, Neil, it's time for America to pray and reexamine how we treat each other. We have to learn to live together as brothers and sisters. We must not perish together. We just can't do it. But this was, you acknowledge, an overreaction, right? I mean, the way they pulled him out of the car, whatever prompted this, whether it was driving radically. Whatever he had done or was suspected of doing. Yes, it's an overreaction. Absolutely. But I was thinking, if this, one of my sons or even me driving recklessly, you know, I don't think they would be treated the same way. I don't think I would be treated the same way. And it feeds a suspicion out there that there's a different sense of justice or legal treatment or police treatment as a result. Do you think that's a fair criticism? And how do you advise young African American males, for example, to deal with this? Well, in our community, if the officers have been blended or ethnically blended, a white, Latino, and black or Asian, any of that, we could bring that into play. And there's a saying that we have, driving while black. But in this case, you're driving while you're black, and you're apprehended by officers who are black. And so just to try to pin racially define it again, this is man's inhumanity to man. Human beings being inhumane to other human beings. Whether or not the suspect had done whatever he may have been guilty of or not, I do believe that often our officers overreact because they're taught to shoot first and ask questions later. To not consider the humanity of the suspects. I believe that's a problem. It has to be dealt with. There has to be some compassionate training. You know, I talked on one of your shows before about a lady who was driving. She was anxious. She was pulled over. She happened to have been Caucasian. And they were rough. The officers were rough with her and yelling at her and all of this. And she was worried she had gotten a report about something was wrong with her child at school. So nothing was considered except she was speeding and she was breaking the law. And what's wrong with her? And nobody even thought about the lady's berets. So do we see human beings in these situations on either side? I believe we've got to look at it from a human perspective. God will remind us we are one blood, one human race, Acts 17, 26. So let's treat each other like human beings. Let's stop being inhumane towards each other. No, you're right about that. In a moment like this, I mean, there's very little time for self-reflection. But I was reminded that even from Benjamin Crump, the lawyer for the family, he was praising local officials how they quickly fired these five police officers. And they drew up charges and they suspended the so-called Scorpion Unit program for the time being. We don't have much, much time, Elvia, but I'm just wondering whether their proactive response saved, you know, what could have been some pretty violent protests last night. From the violent protest. You're right. And I believe in every situation, regardless of the ethnicity or genders of the officers who are in play, if there is overreaction and it should be dealt with swiftly, regardless of skin color, ethnicity and other social issues. So the message from your family when you remember your dad and you remember your uncle, they were alive today reacting to this now. What would they say? They would join me in prayer for the family, for the mother, call for peace, get answers before rushing to a justice that we make up. Let's see what really happened fully in the situation.

It comes a day after a Palestinian gunman killed seven people near a synagogue. Israeli police say they have arrested 42 people in connection with Friday's shooting. The gunman was killed. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has urged Israelis not to take matters into their own hands. On Thursday, nine Palestinians were killed during an Israeli military raid in the West Bank town of Jenin. Our Middle East correspondent, Tom Bateman, reports. They came to pray as the Jewish Sabbath had just got underway. As the night ended, police were counting their bodies in the street. Security forces say the gunman arrived at the synagogue and opened fire. Some people were hit in the panic to get out before the attacker managed to escape and drove off. Then security forces shot him. Well, this is just a few meters from where the shooting took place close to the synagogue. Forensics teams and police now looking at this car, you can clearly see the bullet holes on the driver's side. Witnesses told the BBC the driver then managed to get out and run before being shot dead. I heard shots. There were flashes. And then I saw a car here open, body of the terrorist down. He yelled, Ali Akbar, there's no security in the streets. We need to go down and find these terrorists, ruin their houses, take them out of Israel. At the scene, the head of the Jerusalem police said the attack was one of the worst Israel has seen in years. The attacker is a resident of East Jerusalem. We are completing operations at the scene. Right now, unfortunately, we are talking about seven people killed and another three seriously wounded. As the wounded were taken to hospital, security forces closed off nearby areas searching to see if anyone else was involved. A deadly attack on a Jerusalem synagogue as the world marked International Holocaust Memorial Day. It comes as tensions flare in the region. On Thursday, nine Palestinians were killed by Israeli forces during a raid into Jenin refugee camp in the occupied West Bank. The dead included militants and at least two civilians, according to health officials. Israel said it acted on intelligence of imminent attacks by Islamic Jihad, a Palestinian militant group. They called it a counter-terror operation. In the aftermath, the group vowed to respond. Several rockets were fired on Thursday night from the Gaza Strip, shot down by Israel, which then launched airstrikes on a base operated by Hamas. The escalating violence follows the most deadly period in years in Israel and the West Bank. In Jerusalem, the Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived at the scene of the synagogue shooting, as did his controversial new police minister, while some residents called for revenge. Now, security forces are piecing together exactly who was behind this deadly attack. Tom Bateman, BBC News, Jerusalem. And I'm joined now by our Middle East correspondent, Yolande Nel, who is in Jerusalem. Yolande, first of all, what can you tell us about this latest incident that we're getting reports about? Israeli police saying two people wounded just outside the old city. Yes, this was in Silwan, which is very close to the walled old city in Jerusalem. It's a flashpoint neighborhood because of the presence of Jewish settlers there alongside Palestinian residents. What we're hearing quite shockingly is that a Palestinian boy of 13 was the gunman in this case. That's coming from the police and some mixed reports about where exactly he is from. There are pictures that we've seen from there that show the young boy has been injured and apprehended. At the same time, there are also pictures of the paramedics taking away the two Israeli men who were shot. They're now having hospital treatment. So this is an extremely worrying development with police already on high alert, especially across Jerusalem. We have seen that there are more than 50 arrests in relation to last night's attack, including a lot of members of the family of the 21-year-old Palestinian man who is said to have been responsible. Yolande, we see this happening in cycles, it seems, in the region. Periods where there are clashes, yes, but then punctuated by bloodshed, by lots of deaths. What's behind this latest cycle? I mean, if you look back for at least nine months now, we have seen increasing violence, particularly in the West Bank. And it followed on from a series of deadly attacks that happened in Israel early last year. Then Israel's military launch, what it said, was a counterterrorism offensive in the West Bank, near nightly raids in Palestinian towns and cities. A lot of them are concentrated actually in Jenin, the refugee camp there. Tensions have been extremely high in the background to all of this. And I think if you look at the even wider picture, there is just a sense of people giving up hope. There's been 14 years since peace negotiations stalled. Palestinians don't see any hope of a political solution to this at the moment. They don't have faith in their own political leadership. The security situation fed a lot into Israel's election last year, which brought Benjamin Netanyahu back to power with the support of his far-right allies. If you ask voters, they thought that a lot of these new ministers would have the answers to the security situation. But at the same time, they are within that cabinet, people who have ideas about expanding Israeli settlements in the West Bank, ideas that would end all hopes of a two-state solution here, the idea of creating a Palestinian state alongside Israel. That's the international formula for peace. And we seem to have moved further and further away from it. Yuland, thank you very much. Yuland Nel in Jerusalem, our Middle East correspondent. And we can speak now to Mark Weiss, reporter at the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, KAN News. Mark Weiss, thank you for joining us. So Yuland, just reporting that police are saying the gunman, and I use the word gunman advisedly, in this latest incident is in fact a 13-year-old boy appeals for restraint. But as I was discussing with Yuland, we see these outbreaks of violence. And when I say violence, I mean whether it is serious loss of life from time to time in the region. Do you think there is going to be restraint? How difficult is it going to be to restore some sense of order or calm? Look, let's see how events unfold over the next few days. But it does appear at this juncture that we are at the beginning of a new wave of terrorist attacks. The police have already flooded the areas of Jerusalem that are close to Palestinian neighborhoods with extra forces. Security now at its highest level. Extra troops have been sent to the West Bank. Tonight, Prime Minister Netanyahu will convene a special meeting, an emergency meeting of the Security Cabinet to consider Israel's response. The intelligence community are now working overtime to determine if either of the perpetrators of the last two attacks were connected to any of the militant groups. As you just mentioned, horrifically, the gunman in this morning's attack in Jerusalem was only aged 13. So it's highly unlikely that he was connected to any terrorist group. However, it's possible that one of those groups was behind the attack, gave him the weapon, instructed him how to carry out the attack. Initially, it appears that the man who carried out the synagogue shooting was also unaffiliated. He had no previous history of militant activity. And as far as we know, at this juncture, he wasn't connected to either Hamas, Islamic Jihad or any other group. In this climate, what more do you think the government should or ought to be doing, given that Benjamin Netanyahu now leads a government which includes far-right allies, which has drawn a lot of criticism from many Israelis themselves? Yes, this country is divided down the middle into those who support this new hardline government and those who oppose it quite strongly. Both last weekends have seen massive demonstrations in Tel Aviv, although that was focused particularly on Netanyahu's plans to overhaul the judiciary and hand more powers to the Knesset. This is the first major security challenge facing the new government. And the security cabinet that takes the decisions is unlike any previous security cabinet. It contains many militants, ultra-nationalists who will be demanding a hardline position. Now, they presumably will want to expand Israel's presence in the West Bank, create more settlements, authorize illegal outposts. That would be likely their desired response to a wave of Palestinian terror. But the danger is, of course, that any such moves like this may just inflame tensions further and increase the desire of Palestinian groups to carry out more attacks. So, difficult decisions facing the new government. Mark Weiss, reporter at the Israeli Public Broadcasting Corporation, KAN News. Thank you very much. And of course, here at BBC News, we will be bringing you more reaction to what's going on in the region, more voices on this story throughout the day.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1554\n","\n","Link  169 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/A9ijyOMzlBo\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/A9ijyOMzlBo\n","[youtube] A9ijyOMzlBo: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] A9ijyOMzlBo: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 9.14MiB in 03:02\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Graphic footage has been released of police officers in the US city of Memphis beating a black motorist who died three days after his arrest. The video shows Tyree Nicholls, who was 29, being repeatedly kicked, punched and pepper sprayed as he lies on the ground calling out for his mother. President Biden expressed outrage and deep pain after viewing the footage. Five black officers who've all been fired since the incident a year ago are facing murder charges. A warning, you may find the footage in Neda Taufik's report distressing. Video of the incident is disturbing right from the start. Everything about the officer's approach is aggressive in this initial traffic stop. Taken aback, Tyree Nicholls is heard protesting his innocence. I didn't do anything. I didn't turn your brown. Alright, alright, alright. After officers wrestle him to the ground, he seems to comply with their commands. I'm on the ground. But as this encounter continues, Mr. Nicholls breaks away and flees. The next videos capture the moment five black officers charged with his murder find him and what follows is extremely graphic. At this point, they surround him and brutalize him. Repeatedly, they kick him in the head, strike him with a baton and punch him. I'm a baton the f*** out of you. He the f*** is. In distress, he calls out for his mother. Footage from later shows the officers talking to one another and recounting their version of events. Tyree Nicholls was ultimately taken to the hospital in a critical condition and died three days later from his injuries. We're all being castrated. Officials warned about the video's horrific nature in advance, but nothing could prepare people we met in Memphis for what they would see. As a man of color, it was extremely hard because it could have been me. You know, I've been pulled over for speeding, you know, five, ten miles over, nothing excessive, but you never know what kind of situation that could turn into. No justice! No peace! Protests have been peaceful, perhaps a result of the family's call for calm and the fact that all five black police officers have been charged in Tyree Nicholls' death. After the video's release, the Shelby County Sheriff announced two deputies who responded to the scene have also been relieved of duty. President Biden said he was outraged and deeply pained by the video and echoed Tyree Nicholls' family's calls for peaceful protests. What's at stake is, first of all, innocent people live, number one. Number two, it has a lot to say and do with the image of America. It's an image not helped by these videos. The need for police reform is again at the forefront of people's minds. And we can speak to Neda, who's in Memphis, joins us from Memphis right now. Neda, this video has gripped the national consciousness, hasn't it? Absolutely, Tanya. I mean, who would have thought after the death of George Floyd and the worldwide protests and reckoning for, you know, more reform against police brutality, who would have thought we would see such a graphic video again? And we've heard the family, the family's lawyers and others really compare this to the beating of Rodney King in L.A. back in the 90s. So we're talking decades ago. And this is still such a huge problem in the United States. You know, one organization that tracks police incidents like these found that last year was the highest on record. Now, of course, when we talk about these videos, we also have to talk about the fact that they are, in a way, a progress on one sense, in that they provide evidence of this happening. And it allows authorities to be able to go after officers involved in this type of conduct. But nevertheless, Tanya, it is re-traumatizing for so many people to again have to witness a black man killed and beaten in this way. And there have been protests. That's right. Here in Memphis, people have gathered, a small group, they have taken to the streets peacefully, holding up signs saying justice for Tyree. You know, it was really important to Tyree Nichols' mother that the protesters remained peaceful. She said, if this is really about my son, then you will honor him. He was someone who was, she said, pretty near perfect. And she said, this is the city that we all have to live in. So we have to go about this in a way that we express how we feel, but together as a community. And that's exactly what we've seen earlier. There were people out in the streets protesting peacefully. In fact, they've all gone home now. It's pretty quiet here in Memphis. And there have been protests in other cities as well. But I think the reason, again, a lot of what we're seeing has been peaceful is because in this case, at least, the family has said they're happy with how swiftly the officers are now having to face accountability and how swiftly the police department worked on this investigation. Neda, thank you very much indeed. Well, let's now go to Jimmy Kundu, who is a lawyer and has worked with Crime Stoppers in Houston. Welcome to the program. Thanks for joining us. When you watch this video, what do you deduce from it? I deduce from it that we have a problem in this country that we must address with all necessary haste. The struggle against police brutality must be addressed on a local level, meaning cities, counties, states must be addressed on a local level. There's thousands of law enforcement agencies throughout the United States, and they essentially operate independently, which makes it very difficult for federal oversight. And that's why we have to get involved on the grassroots level and address these problems there. What do you conclude from the fact that these officers were themselves black? When a person becomes a police officer, they're no longer a black police officer. They're not a white police officer or Hispanic police officer. They are a blue police officer. And that is the culture. And it is blue against everybody else. The problem is, in the training that some of these police officers are getting, is they are training to police persons of different colors and nationalities in a very improper and very different way. And that's what needs to stop. But even if that is the case, then what is seen on the video is completely unprofessional. Absolutely, it's completely unprofessional. There's good police officers out there. The majority of police officers out there are good police officers. But it's not a profession where you can afford to have a bad police officer because people's lives are at stake. And what the police officers did here has led to the swift firing of these police officers, a record time indictment, 19 days from the time of the interaction to the time of the indictment and charges, where the officers now are facing serious allegations for second degree murder, assault, kidnapping, official misconduct. And things of that nature. And historically, what you see when a police officer has been charged or has been accused of a certain crime involving police brutality, there's been lots of frustration. The information from the police departments has been slow. Prosecution has been slow, if any at all indictments are issued. Here, I see it as a moment of progress and perhaps this becomes a new pattern for holding public officials accountable because the prosecution moved in a record time. But where we are talking about a situation where it's not just a question of a few individuals, but a culture that is endemic in police forces around the country, that's a very difficult problem to fix, isn't it? It's a very difficult problem. It's essential that law enforcement includes treating all persons of equal amounts of care, all persons of different backgrounds, ethnicities, colors, with equal amounts of care, equal amounts of dignity, equal amounts of concern. Every person has the same right to life and humane treatment. And that's what needs to be taught to police officers in order to institute change. But there's other methods of deterrence available as well. We've talked about the criminal prosecution aspect, but there are civil actions which are available to families and survivors of police brutality as well. On the state level, a police officer can be sued individually and a police department can be sued for police brutality. On the federal level, under our federal statutes here, which are 42 USC 1983, it's harder to sue an individual police officer successfully. But what families can often do is look to sue the department or agency which supervises those police officers. And when a judgment is rendered, it impacts the funding of that agency. And that agency has to then look internally at what it's teaching and how it's recruiting and monitoring its officers. And that's a form of deterrent that is available to victims of police brutality.

Because of the unique nature of the government over there, we have all seen the BBC documentary which has been banned in the biggest democracy of the world, the professed biggest democracy of the world.

They're fun, entertaining. You giggle with it, you laugh with it, you share it with your friends. But then after you watch the video, you realize that, hey, Nurse John is crying in his video and having a mental breakdown. I've just had that exact mental breakdown yesterday from work because of how hard it is working in a short staff condition.

This was the Battle of Kursk, which saw thousands of Nazi and Soviet tanks fight in fields not far from the current conflict in Ukraine. Hundreds of thousands died in this battle alone. The horrors of the Second World War, the horrors they inflicted on their neighbors, have guided German foreign policy ever since. So in the German tank, I would say, it's really the symbolism of the first part of the Second World War, the Wehrmacht overrunning Europe. And we all know what then comes. So therefore, in a way, you could say it's a very strong symbol. After the war, the Germans said never again. The guiding principles in Berlin were Ostpolitik, East politics, and Vandeldurck Handel, change through trade. The idea was that by engaging with Russia, by building economic links, war in Europe could be avoided. But the invasion of Ukraine showed that was an illusion. Chancellor Olaf Scholz ripped up decades of consensus with his Zeitung vendor turning point speech, although some do question quite how radical a shift that represented. So they will always see what the partners are doing. And one of the German reference points in their security policy is never alone. So one is never again, never be perpetrator, never war again. But if the alliance goes to war or the partners goes to war, then Germany follows, but not from the front, but more from the rear. That reluctance fed through to decisions at the start of the war about arming Ukraine. Germany was mocked and criticized in equal measure for offering to send helmets. Since then, there's been growing pressure to arm Ukraine, including with heavy weapons like the Leopard 2 tank and to allow others to do the same. Today that finally happened. The Leopard tank is the most in demand by Ukrainians because it is relatively easy to operate and maintain. And it exists in large numbers. There are something like 2000 in Europe. And that means that there are plenty of spares, plenty of maintenance expertise, plenty of maintenance facilities. So it's the easiest thing to give to Ukraine that gives them advanced capability in a supportable way. But the Leopard 2 isn't the only tank being promised. The U.S. have said they will send Abrams. The U.K. are sending these, the massive Challenger 2. The French could send their Leclercs. And while the Ukrainians say they do welcome all the assistance, there are real problems from having so many different tanks all operating on the same battlefield. No nation wants to operate different fleets of tanks because these are really big and complex machines and they require their own supply chains for spares and their own maintenance expertise. And where we've ended up in Ukraine is that Ukraine will operate the M1 Abrams with its own supply chain, the Leopard with its own supply chain, the Challenger with its own supply chain and require to train people specifically to maintain those types of tanks. So what about the numbers? Well, the Ukrainians say that they need 300 main battle tanks like this to turn the tide of this war. So what's being offered? The U.K. is sending 14 main battle tanks, the U.S. 31, Germany also 14. When you add in other promises, it comes to just over 130, significant but short of what the Ukrainians say they need. And there is another problem. They have to get to Ukraine. That's the easy part. The hard part is training Ukrainians to fight the tank and repair them and refuel them. That is going to take some months to get a critical mass of each type. And Russia is likely to be ready to mount its own offensive in Ukraine this summer before Ukraine has assembled this newly offered equipment and got it ready to fight. This is an original piece of the Berlin Wall. And in many ways, the relationship between Russia and Germany helped shape the 20th century. It is already having an impact in the 21st. Eighty years on from the Battle of Kursk, and we may soon see German tanks heading east again, although this time the context could not be more different. There is no overstating the symbolic importance of this moment. Whether it will prove decisive on the battlefield is another matter entirely.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 740\n","\n","Link  175 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/crGNMSNV0-k\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/crGNMSNV0-k\n","[youtube] crGNMSNV0-k: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] crGNMSNV0-k: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 5.63MiB in 01:41\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Shwa wewe Lafole?

Bilal al-Sudani is alleged to have been central to the group's operations right across Africa. Well, joining me now from Nairobi is our deputy Africa editor, Anne Sawyer. And just give me a little more detail on what it appears US special forces did. Well, the fact that the special forces actually went there, set aside resources to either kill or capture al-Sudani just shows you the significance of this figure in the region. However, we're talking about ISIS in Somalia. This is a very small, one of the smallest parts of ISIS. However, it is thought that they are more important in that region for financial reasons. They're a conduit for finances going to other regions of the world for ISIS. He was thought to be number two in the ISIS in Somalia wing. The group has dwindled over the years because there is a bigger group, the al-Qaeda-linked al-Shabaab militant group that is more active in Somalia. And they have been engaged in attacks against each other in the past. Now under our previous US presidents, it wasn't unusual to see US special forces make these direct interventions in Somalia. It hasn't happened in Somalia under the Biden administration. What kind of reaction do you think there will be from inside the country and indeed elsewhere in the region? Well, you will remember that during the Trump administration, the forces were withdrawn from Somalia. And however, they did not go far. They have been near the border in Kenya, and then they returned there. Over the past couple of weeks, we have seen increasing activity where they have been backing the Somali national forces in its growing and intensifying fight against al-Shabaab. And just a word on what actually is quite an extraordinary claim coming from US officials that al-Sudani, his network, didn't just reach into other parts of Africa. There's also a claim that he had links to the al-Kharasan group in Afghanistan. What can you tell me about that, Anne? Yes, we are seeing analysis coming out. He wasn't a figure that was very well known outside, but he was clearly in the radar of the Americans. And it's because of that financial hub activity in the north of Somalia that has been not only going to Afghanistan, but you also understand some of it has been going to Iraq and the Levant. And so it is an important group in that sense. He is part of a group that is headed by al-Kharar Abdul-Kadir Mumin in northern Somalia. And it's a very remote location. So some of the information has been trickling out of that remote location very slowly. However, ordinarily, what we have seen more in Somalia, a lot of the American activity in Somalia has been drone attacks. But in this particular case, they did send the special forces there. So it was an important operation for them. All right.

It was a big week for the online moderation and censorship debate, particularly with the suppression of a BBC documentary about Prime Minister Narendra Modi. Here's Peter O'Brien for a closer look. Hi, Peter. Hi, Monty. So what's the latest on this Modi documentary? Well, it's highly critical of Narendra Modi's role during the 2002 anti-Muslim riots in Gujarat, which killed more than a thousand people. There are people interviewed in the documentary that say he directly enabled the killing. And last weekend, the Indian federal government thought they could kind of do away with some of the embarrassment of this documentary by banning people from sharing clips of it online, citing emergency powers. They also ordered social media platforms to take down clips and links of the documentary and claimed that Twitter and YouTube complied with that. So did it work? Well, talk about the Streisand effect. Reports about how successful the takedown was vary. The Guardian says about 50 Twitter accounts had content removed and an unspecified number of YouTube accounts had content removed. Some people say in India today, if you look on Twitter, you can't find stuff on the documentary at all. But what is clear is that the internet has done what it does so well so often, which is circumvent these sorts of bans and has found a way to blow up the documentary, perhaps beyond the popularity that it would have even achieved had the ban not been put in place. So clips have spread like wildfire, especially on alternative messaging channels, things like WhatsApp, where there isn't sort of public view on all the chats that people are having. And the appetite is such that we've seen activists and students actually continue to organise screenings of the documentary that you can see here in public. This is even after riot police turned up at Jami Amilia University in New Delhi and detained a number of students who were planning their own screening. Let's hear from Aloysius Savier, a student union leader in Kerala, about how important the documentary is to them. Trying to wiping out the or they're trying to ban the particular documentary from the public domain or the mainstream media. The government has something to hide from this particular incident. Otherwise, they are afraid of being streaming across the country. Well, so Peter, you mentioned the emergency powers the Indian government is using to justify this. What exactly are they? So that will be the information technology rules passed in 2021, which give the government the power to get rid of any content that it sees as threatening the unity, integrity, defence, security or sovereignty of India. These rules have been criticised by rights groups for being overzealous draconian, but it's actually more of a cementing of existing and ongoing policy research done by the Indian Express newspaper showed that legal demands made by the Modi government to remove content from Twitter increased by a staggering 48000 percent from 2014 to 2020. That's before the law even came into effect. It also doesn't hurt the Modi government that there's a new man in charge of Twitter. The Intercept reports that before Elon Musk took over in October, Twitter was fairly reluctant to remove content, only removing about a fifth of the stuff that the Indian government requested would be removed. Some think that the action to the BBC documentaries are sign that Modi is now winning the fight against Twitter. In the past, it had threatened to jail Twitter staff if they didn't comply with orders to take down accounts. And now, well, there aren't much stuff left since since Musk took over 90 percent of Twitter staff in India has been let go. Well, so how have Twitter and YouTube both responded to these claims of censorship? Elon Musk's response is very much, I'm too busy. He paints himself as a crusader of free speech, as we all know. So understandably, he's come under criticism for this. But he tweeted in response that it's not possible for me to fix every aspect of Twitter worldwide overnight while still running Tesla and SpaceX. It's a bit harder to pin down YouTube. They've not responded to questions about Modi's intervention specifically, but have said that the documentary was removed in certain cases because of a copyright claim by the BBC. And Modi has a big fan who's back on Twitter. Yes, that's right. Bollywood actress Ranganar Ranaut has been reinstated after a two year ban for violating policies on hateful and abusive content on Twitter. She's a huge supporter of Modi. She was kicked off Twitter in May 2021 for controversial statements following post-election violence in Bengal. Now, she joins thousands of previously banned accounts who've come in since Musk took over, of course, including that of former president, US President Donald Trump. Incidentally, Metta announced on Thursday that Donald Trump would be coming back to Facebook and Instagram, or at least his accounts would be reactivated. Since he's been reinstalled on Twitter, he's actually not tweeted a single thing. He's kept Shtem. So we'll see if that remains the case now that he's on more platforms. Yeah, he may stick to his own platform. We'll have to see. Okay, Peter, thanks so much. Thank you.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 890\n","\n","Link  180 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/vkXcMmhYzSY\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/vkXcMmhYzSY\n","[youtube] vkXcMmhYzSY: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] vkXcMmhYzSY: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 3.56MiB in 01:09\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  The contentious BBC documentary on Prime Minister Modi has left the opinion divided not just in India but also outside. British MP Bob Blackman has described the documentary as disgraceful and a hatchet job on Prime Minister Modi. Here's more. If the movie doesn't complete today, we will call you tomorrow or the day after. One minute, one hour call. One hour call. Wildcat screenings. Some successful, some not. The BBC documentary on Prime Minister Modi has left the opinion divided not just in India but also overseas. Mr Speaker, the UK government's position on this has been clear and long standing and hasn't changed. Of course, we don't tolerate persecution where it appears anywhere, but I'm not sure I agree at all with the characterisation that the Honourable Gentleman has put forward. The BBC's programme critiqued overtly and covertly even in the UK. Conservative MP Bob Blackman, the latest lawmaker in Britain, to voice his criticism of the controversial documentary, calling it disgraceful. The BBC documentary on the Prime Minister Modi has left the opinion divided not just in India but also overseas. The BBC documentary on the Prime Minister Modi has left the opinion divided not just in the UK. The final issue I just want to touch on is the absolute disgraceful BBC propaganda programmes that have been on over the last two weeks. Now, last week we had what can only be described as a major shock to us on Srinivasa Modi when he was Chief Minister of Gujarat. Black man was speaking at an event on the plight of Kashmiri Pandits. He also appreciated the Modi government's measures like the abrogation of Jammu and Kashmir's special status. Back home though, some students attempts to screen the BBC documentary on campus prompted institutions to issue advisories. The Tata Institute of Social Sciences in Mumbai put out a notice prohibiting any such activity over law and order concerns. Police had to intervene when similar attempts were made at the Delhi University allegedly by outsiders. But political opponents of the Modi government maintained their defiant stance. Congress MP Karti Chidambaram endorsed the screening in a tweet insisting it's must watch for every young citizen.

Palestinian media has shown video of explosions and heavy gunfire in the camp. The Health Ministry said the situation was critical, with many people wounded and ambulances unable to get to them. Israeli reports say security forces went into Jenin to arrest a member of the armed group Islamic Jihad, said to have been planning an attack. Our Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman reports. A storm of gunfire and tear gas in a packed urban refugee camp. Israel's raid began early this morning. More than 100 military vehicles entered the camp, say witnesses. It is the most deadly single Israeli raid into Jenin since a new wave of violence hit the region last spring. We heard gunshots, we fled into the Jenin club and we stayed under siege there for three hours. The army besieged us in the club and we heard the sounds of clashes. After about an hour, military bulldozers destroyed cars on both sides of the road, then destroyed the club's wall. Palestinians say that for some time the Israelis stopped ambulances reaching the wounded, describing the situation as critical. In the aftermath, another part of Jenin camp is seen reduced to wreckage. The Israeli army says it surrounded a building to capture Islamic Jihad militants. A huge gunfight then erupted. A children's ward of a local hospital was hit by tear gas, say health officials, and Palestinian leaders have called for urgent international help, calling this a massacre. Israel says it acted based on precise intelligence of major attacks by Islamic Jihad. The army raids have been near nightly for months now, as Israel says it's been acting to stem the worst spate of attacks in years against its citizens. It had already been a deadly month for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank, with 20 killed so far in January, militants and civilians. A boy like this should have been able to have his childhood. What happened to that right? In Deheisha refugee camp during a raid last week, soldiers shot dead a 13-year-old boy, Amr al-Khomor. The army said some Palestinians threw stones, petrol bombs and explosive devices, but gave no specific account of why the teenager was shot. At the family home, neighbours arrived to mourn. If a boy hits me with a stone, should I get a pistol and shoot him? There are things that the mind can comprehend. It's beyond belief. To kill a child, to kill a boy. I'm helpless. I'm speechless. Here, national flags hang beside those of the PFLP, a political and armed faction seen by Palestinians as part of their resistance. It's listed by Israel and the West as a terrorist group. America's top diplomat arrives in the region in days. The US has already said it is deeply concerned about escalating violence. It worries too about a political crisis in Israel, as fears mount of a much further flare-up.

Newsreader Mahmoud Al-Masalami has been the station's signature voice for 30 years. Fittingly, he read the final bulletin. Cost cutting has led to nearly 400 job losses at the BBC's World Service and the number of foreign language radio channels being brought to a close. Al-Masalami, fresh from that final broadcast, is full of memories from his time at the service and before that, his time as a listener in Cairo. The old people used to go in the room and close it because they are not allowed and put their ears and they suffer to listen. The only voice different from the official voice. You lost 85 years of being on air, you lost millions of listeners, you lost this credibility, you lost very strong soft power. It was in 1938 when the BBC itself was only 16 years old that Arabic became its first foreign language service. Saudi, Yemeni, Iraqi and Egyptian dignitaries were invited for the occasion. Its popularity grew fast, famous voices bringing news of era-defining events in a form unmediated, uncensored by the audience's rulers. One former staffer I spoke to this week called the decision to end the service a gift to dictators. The radio service ends with nearly five million listeners a week, some of them particularly devoted. Abdullah Abdelrahman says without it, there is no point in keeping his radio. If they end the broadcast, they have ended our lives. This station has become an addiction to us. The news and the London broadcast are all we know. We are old, I am 80 years old. I have been listening to it for more than 30 years. The broadcaster says it is part of a digital first strategy. Arabic language audio programmes and podcasts will still be found on its website and the TV service will continue as before. So the legacy itself will not be lost.

Pressures on the BBC's finances have been mounting, requiring ever harder choices, but for many inside and outside the organisation, this has been a sad day.

Auckland's mayors declared a state of emergency on Friday as rising floodwaters left streets and homes swamped. New Zealand's Meteorological Service issued severe weather warnings as the torrential rain continued to fall. Ricardo Menendez-March is a New Zealand Green MP who was forced to evacuate his own home in Auckland. He says floodwaters were rising rapidly. This is not something that we are used to, but climate change is inevitably making these sort of events more frequent in the city and in the country. When it started raining, many of us did not expect our neighbourhoods to get so flooded, but in a matter of an hour, my local area was already flooded and the water was coming all the way almost to our shoulders. So we had to make a prompt evacuation. It was relatively quick and I was privileged enough to have given shelter by a mate who lived nearby, but there were people who were unfortunately not as lucky, low-income communities, disabled people, migrant communities as well, and there's already been a casualty reported in the city. We know that the rain is going to continue overnight and even though there's been a state of emergency declared, it's only recently that shelters have been open to the general population. And so for many people, they have some time ahead when there will be some uncertainty. And it goes without saying that we need to have a conversation about how climate change is making these events more frequent and how cities like Auckland are massively underprepared to deal with flooding events, which are going to become more frequent.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 296\n","\n","Link  187 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/5Fqu3_X2AlE\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Fqu3_X2AlE\n","[youtube] 5Fqu3_X2AlE: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 5Fqu3_X2AlE: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 2.90MiB in 00:58\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  This has not been screened in India, so I have only got to comment on the context of what I have heard about the, or what my colleagues have seen.

Now at the age of 61, Petr Pavel has been elected president of the Czech Republic. He's promised to be a dignified president for all the country's 10.5 million people. I understand that there are some who are disappointed because their favorite candidate did not win. But I also see that in this country we do not have winning or losing voters. I see that values won in this election. Values such as truth, dignity, respect and humility. As predicted, Pavel easily beat his 68-year-old rival, Andrei Babiš, a billionaire who served as prime minister between 2017 and 2021. Babiš's closeness to outgoing president Miloš Zeman may have hindered him. Zeman's a divisive figure who developed close ties with Moscow before making a U-turn when Russia invaded Ukraine last year. Petr Pavel, unlike his rival, came out strongly in favor of further military aid for Ukraine. He was always the favorite despite revelations he'd received training in military intelligence in the former Czechoslovakia when it was ruled by communists backed by Moscow. The Czech president appoints the prime minister as well as constitutional judges, but the results are unlikely to significantly change the country's foreign policy.

The IMF is sending a team next week amid a standoff with the government over reforms. So how is this crisis affecting Pakistan's people and what does the future hold. This is Inside Story. Hello and welcome to the program. I'm fully back to both Pakistan's economic crisis is deepening with the rupee this week hitting its lowest level on record against the US dollar. Foreign exchange reserves are running out. The state is holding only enough to pay for vital imports such as fuel for another three weeks. The IMF has cut off funding in a standoff with the government over reforms. That's money the country needs to keep going. An IMF team will visit next week for what are expected to be tough talks. Now all this comes as the country is reeling from its most devastating floods in living memory. It faces deep political divisions too along with high inflation during an uncertain global economic climate. We'll be looking at what's behind the crisis with our guests. But before that our correspondent Kamal Haider has this report from Islamabad on how people there are feeling. It's another day at Islamabad Friday Bazaar as people go around shopping for essential goods. But there is bad news on the economic front. The Pakistani rupee tumbled against the US dollar by almost 10 percent. And that too from a government which was promising to bring change to Pakistan. According to the Financial Times the country is on the brink of collapse and an economic crisis which could be comparable to what happened to Sri Lanka which ran out of foreign exchange reserves. Pakistan's foreign exchange reserves are at an all time low and the country is trying to negotiate with the IMF which after the devaluation of the rupee has agreed to come to Pakistan to discuss its conditionality is to resume that bailout package for Pakistan. But economists warn that money will not be enough to address Pakistan's key economic problems. Industry is shutting down because energy costs have been going up. Imports are stuck at the ports because the banks will not open the letter of credit because of a acute shortage of foreign exchange particularly US dollars. We've been speaking to people on the ground and this is what they tell us. Where I was earning 500 rupees a day even then I was happy as things were affordable. But now even if I'm earning three times that still it's hard to survive as prices are beyond our reach. Both buyers and sellers are worried due to high inflation. Look at the devaluation of the rupee. Obviously that'll increase the petrol prices and other commodities. Unfortunately there's a total fail to the current government and wrong policies which has brought the country to the verge of collapse. The devaluation of the rupee will hit the people hard. They're already struggling to survive with essential commodities and they of course will be apprehensive because of the knock on effect on the prices of essential items. Pakistan is importing wheat which is a staple in this country because of acute shortages. And this of course will mean that every essential commodity will see a price hike. Something that the people of Pakistan can afford. Well Pakistan has been hit by a series of shocks all contributing to its economic problems. The worst floods in living memory killed around 1700 people with widespread devastation costing around 30 billion dollars. There's deep political division to Prime Minister Shabar Sharif and his predecessor Imran Khan who was ousted in a no confidence vote blame each other for the crisis. Power outages to save money have caused chaos and hit businesses. The state's foreign exchange reserves have shrunk to just over three and a half billion dollars. Well let's bring in our guests now for today's show from Islamabad. Nila for a free because she is a disaster management professional from Peshawar. Acta Ali Shah a political analyst and a former secretary to Pakistan's government home and tribal affairs department and also in Islamabad. Abid Hassan an economist and a former adviser to the World Bank. Welcome to Inside Story. Thank you so much for joining us. Mr. Abid Hassan in Islamabad. If I can start with you. What led to such a significant drop in the value of the Pakistani rupee. And what does it mean for a country that's already facing multiple crises. Well I mean it's a culmination of following terrible policies economic policies especially fiscal policies monetary exchange rate over maybe three four decades. So for the last one decade and a half knowledgeable people policy analysts have been writing about it. I've been speaking about it that unless reforms take place Pakistan is headed for a crisis. And surely this was predicted. Now the thing is if you look back 30 years earlier the crisis was every five years. The duration of that crisis has been narrowing shortening and the magnitude has been increasing. So now I mean even if the IMF were to bail us out and we will probably have another crisis in two years or even less than that because the whole economy is now hardwired for a boom and bust cycle. So unless we have deep reforms which will be painful we will have another crisis. I don't know in 12 months 18 months despite the IMF program. But just looking at the more recent crisis and the plunge of the rupee Pakistan abandoned control of its control of its currency in order to meet the IMF's demand right to liberalize the exchange rate. Will that be enough to bring the IMF on board in your opinion now and get this bail out going. I think one of the fundamental pillars of any IMF program is there should not be a multiple exchange policy. And Pakistan had three exchange rates over the last eight nine months. I think that was a bad policy. So so clearly I mean it seems that the government has decided to unify the exchange rate and make it market based. The other is for decades Pakistan was following a very bad pricing policy on energy even though most of energy is imported. We were selling it at below import costs. We were selling it at below production costs and for at least two decades the IMF and the World Bank have been pushing Pakistan to rationalize energy prices. I think that's the second thing on the table which they will require Pakistan to adjust energy prices. And of course all these things will lead to inflation. The key thing here is that at this point in time it's a bit like cancer. Anything there is no treatment without pain. So the important thing is and the IMF continues to sort of press any country on that. Look one needs to protect the poor from loss of income or high inflation and the rich must be a large burden of that pain. And that's the important thing that one hopes that the government of the day and the political system and the key stakeholders are able to figure out a program that protects the poor while having the rich pay for the burden. All right. Nilo fair in Islamabad. You have today more than 9000 containers that are stuck at ports which are carrying essential goods. How bad is the situation today for the average Pakistani citizen. How are people able to cope on a daily basis with the skyrocketing inflation. They are not. Thank you for inviting me on the program. I would like to add to what Abid Hassan was saying. The IMF bailout is only a stopgap. The average Pakistani is poor. And so the reforms that the IMF suggest is suggesting is only for an injection for money which will not actually feed the poor which is the vast majority of Pakistanis. And the question that you have asked of me and all the natural disasters that we have only multiply the existing problematic in Pakistan where the average person is unable to earn unable to pay taxes unable to be self sustainable in the best of times let alone when there's an international crisis etc. The question to be asked is in an agricultural based polity in an agricultural based economy why are we importing essential goods. Why have why have the international community and the government of Pakistan which it follows its lead because it borrows so much. Why are the structural reforms that we are constantly being asked don't focus on fundamental reforms not only in the energy sector or tax sector. So you offer who or Nelofa who or what do you blame for the crisis. I blame the the class that is the permanent state managers of Pakistan for the last 70 years. Their priorities of where they want to invest in Pakistan's economy quality human development has resulted that the vast majority of this country cannot look after itself and all the international aid whether it's IMF bilateral or stopgap measures just as Abed Hassan just mentioned whether we get the IMF or whether we get China or America the EU ADB to help us. That is just a stopgap for one year two year. OK. It does not address our investment lack of investment in Pakistan. In Pakistan OK. OK. Aqtar Ali Shah. Let me bring you into the conversation. As Abed said an economic crisis in Pakistan comes around every few years but this time around the internal political crisis and the recent flooding seems to have made things worse. To what extent are the political tension that tensions that we've seen the ouster of former prime minister Imran Khan in a no confidence vote. The protests that we've seen to what extent is the political instability shaping these economic problems. Certainly politics can not be isolated from economics and economics can't be divorced from politics. We call it political economy. Today's issues of economics are tomorrow's and all political parties when they go to the people they have their manifestos where they promise good things of life to the people when they come to the power. And today this economic growth is not development as is defined and has a wider connotation. It is not merely measurement of the economic growth but it also includes social development as mentioned by Madam Qazi. So if there is instability naturally the there will be strikes slowdowns then there will be disturbance for supply chain. Right. In the whole of the country. And there will be no productions. So a conducive environment is always required for economic growth. Right. Well what about the security situation. Can I ask you about the security situation please because it would seem that the Pakistani Taliban have been emboldened by a Taliban ruled Afghanistan nearby. To what extent is that a concern for investors today who are looking at Pakistan. Of course when we compare the statistics compared to the last year there is a surge as far as terrorist activities within Pakistan and particularly the province of Khyber and Balochistan. And they are without increasingly targeting the law enforcing agencies. So now there is a fear and sense of insecurity among even the general citizens and the traders and the businessmen. Those are prosperous. They are being threatened and extortion calls are being given to them across the border even. And even you see the the provincial assembly of the province that has been dissolved. And according to the constitution there was a requirement to apply the day within 90 days. But so far the government of Khyber and the governor who is under obligation under the constitution to announce the day. OK. But he is on record that the elections may be postponed due to due to economic emergency and incidents of terrorism. And when the governor of the province and I will come back Mr. Ali Akhtar I'll come back to the issue of elections later because of course Imran Khan the former prime minister wants elections to be held. I'll come back to that in a moment. But I want to come back to the economic situation and ask Mr. Abir Hassan in Islamabad whether Pakistan today is at risk of becoming another Sri Lanka and defaulting. I think I would you know hate to say this but the probability is very high. Unless immediately a government is able to satisfy the IMF and they sort of disperse their next tranche. Once the IMF disperses a billion dollars then there are other bilateral countries especially Saudi Arabia China maybe I don't know some Gulf countries who basically suggest we will put in a billion two billion once Pakistan you know has a program. Do you think the government is in a better position. Today our reserves would probably go up from three. Sorry to interrupt you. But do you think the Pakistani government is in a better position to comply with the demands of the IMF. Is the government in a better position today to meet those demands. Look the thing is they've come in. Now they are sitting in the saddle. If they don't comply and Pakistan goes the Sri Lanka route I think the chances of ever coming back into politics is zero. If they comply sure enough it'll be painful but at least there's some probability that when the elections come around they could still contest. So from the government's perspective I think for that they were kind of you know I mean resisting all these changes hoping against hope that somebody will build them out. And ultimately you know none of the friendly countries came forward to the tune that was needed. OK. So my point is it's a bitter pill but they'll have to swallow that. OK. Nila Far I want to come back to you and ask you more about the situation of the average Pakistani citizen. And I know you've worked in flood affected areas. You've been you know involved in relief operations there. So I wanted if you can to you to tell us about give us concrete examples of how Pakistanis today are suffering whether it's in big cities like Islamabad or Peshawar or whether it's in flood affected areas. How are people living on a day to day basis. OK we'll focus on the flood affected areas but the crunch is being felt amongst ninety nine percent of the country. The permanent powers are and those who live off government subsidies those who have enriched themselves over the last 70 years they are insulated from the shocks of this country. But the average person and those who are affected in this round of floods 2022. Don't forget we also have had floods in 2010 and then we have regular flooding as well which doesn't capture the national or the international imagination. But since 2022 has we talk about that that has hit the most destitute parts of Balochistan and Sindh. These two and a little bit of KPK as well and a tiny portion of southern Punjab as well. But the vast majority that were hit were in Sindh and in Balochistan and in areas where the human development indicators are abysmal and by any standard by the national standard but also the global UN standards for living. Government of Pakistan and the provincial governments of Pakistan have let down these citizens for the last 70 years. The floods has only exacerbated it. So for example women have given birth without housing. They continue to remain without a roof over their head. Children are without doctors. You have no hospitals. There is not enough medicine. You have high malaria incidents like 80 percent communities 90 percent communities with massive critical health care needs with absolutely no medicines no doctors no housing food insecure. They are malnourished. I mean it's really a raft of issues. Yeah. Let me ask you Nila for if the IMF were to put the money in today. Do you think it would get to the people who need it the most. No it will not. And why do you think that is. And how can we change that. Because the reason why is the allocation and the so called structural reform is focusing on areas which benefit primarily the upper and the middle class in the urban areas. They where government chooses not to invest in the social development sector and the human investment human development investment that requires to pull up the average citizen. More than half this country is illiterate. This is a multi generational investment that you need to develop. And that is not the concern of IMF. OK. That is the concern of government of Pakistan. And not this government alone. The previous government and the government before that and the government before that they are frankly part of the problem. So it's a deep noted problem. OK. Let me ask Abir Hassan. So what do you think is the way out for Pakistan Abir Hassan and what economic policy should the Pakistani government adopt to address these economic difficulties. So I mean in the most immediate term the only policy they need to do is follow the IMF sort of reform program in in letter and spirit. So they get immediate inflow of foreign exchange so that they don't default. And in some sort of normalcy comes to the importation of goods. But beyond that when I say beyond that I mean in the next six to twelve months they'll have to address the whole issue of energy pricing because the energy sector is bleeding billions of rupees a day. And that's part of the reason of this crisis. They've kept energy prices cheap. So when the energy prices are cheap you suck in more imports. So you have to price energy right so that the demand for energy goes down and imports go down. So that's the next one. You see the important thing is you can't think medium term or long term if you're going to sink in the short term. So in the short term the important thing is you don't sink. And the only way you to avoid sinking is you have to implement the IMF program in letter and spirit. And then as you get a breathing space I think the key stakeholders of this country need to get together and agree on a common platform of economic reforms. OK. Let me know that this thing will just keep coming back and haunting. Yeah. Let me give the final word if I can. Yeah. What is the way forward for Pakistan for Pakistan to avoid sinking. As Abed said there. And I know that the former prime minister Imran Khan is pushing for elections to be held this year as soon as possible. They're scheduled for October. Will holding elections change the direction in which Pakistan is headed. We have a constitution in Pakistan and the constitution has demarcated all the areas including the elections as far as Imran Khan's party is concerned. They the day war in Punjab and have a lot of fun. The assemblies of both the process have been dissolved. And now there is a stipulated period within the Constitution and Election Act 2017 where in the elections are required to be held within 90 days. But the governments are avoiding to hold the election on one protection or the other. So the way forward to my mind is let let there be elections with the province and later on then elections to the National Assembly can be considered. But first and foremost is the elections to the provincial assembly. And the promise of Punjab. OK. But if these elections are avoided it would send wrong signals rather negative signals from the investors all over the world and our economy will further suffer. OK. Let's leave it. I'm sorry to interrupt you. We'll leave it there. We've run out of time. Unfortunately thank you so much for joining us today on this very important discussion.

The Russian oligarch who owns a mercenary army and enlists courts overseas to keep the truth contained. Plus, the working class versus the mass media. Makes me laugh that your level of journalism has descended so far that you can't think of any other question. The union leader who's exposing biased British journalism. Hello, I'm Richard Gisbert and you're at The Listening Post where we dig into the coverage and analyze how news gets reported. We begin with the BBC series about Narendra Modi, the Indian government's decision to ban the documentaries and the fallout. The first installment of the series takes viewers back 20 years to 2002 and communal rioting in the state of Gujarat in which more than a thousand people, the vast majority of the Muslim, were killed. The film features a British government investigation which concluded that Modi, who was in charge of Gujarat at the time as its chief minister, was directly responsible for those murders. That the riots which police stood by and let happen bore the hallmarks of ethnic cleansing. India's Supreme Court later cleared Modi of wrongdoing and since his election as prime minister in 2014, journalists have treated this story as a red line not to be crossed. The government's decision to ban the BBC documentary, which extends to social media, has become its own story. It has also drawn global attention to Modi's record in office and the subsequent decline of media freedom in the world's largest democracy. In this digital world where brevity is king and short punchy news stories are designed for shrinking attention spans, the BBC's series India, The Modi Question, speaks to the impact that long form investigative journalism can still have. Episode 1 of the series focuses on 2002 and the communal violence between Hindus and Muslims that shook the western state of Gujarat. Gujarat was led at the time by Narendra Modi, who 12 years later was elected India's prime minister, having tried and mostly succeeded in putting allegations of complicity in the riots behind him, until now. Modi has spent a lot of time refurbishing his image on the international stage. This was a man who was once banned from entering the US and the UK. He's now remade his image as someone who is on the world stage and welcomed and looked up to. And this documentary brings back in very stark terms what they have worked very hard to suppress and bury. The Supreme Court has essentially dismissed all cases against Prime Minister Modi in the context of the Gujarat riots. So even domestic audiences don't talk about it very often. So why is the BBC bringing this up? What could be the motivation? That's the reaction from the Indian government. We think this is a propaganda piece designed to push a particular discredited narrative. The bias, lack of objectivity and frankly a continuing colonial mindset is blatantly visible. Every possible allegation that has been leveled against the prime minister and how his government handled Gujarat riots has been repeated ad nauseum. And the truth is that nothing has really hurt the prime minister. In fact, the Gujarat riots and the way it has been handled has been the reason why the BJP keeps returning to power. The Gujarat riots were set off when a train there was set on fire and 59 Hindus were killed. Members of the Muslim minority were blamed. Revenge was quick in coming. For three days, Muslims were targeted. Nearly a thousand of them were killed. Journalists from various news outlets, not just the BBC, reported that police mostly stood by and let it happen. It was assumed they were following orders from on high. Just how high has always been the question. The BBC documentary revealed that because three of the Muslims killed were British citizens, the UK government conducted its own investigation into what happened. The report, sent as a diplomatic cable and marked restricted, has never been published before. Investigators concluded that Narendra Modi was directly responsible for the pogrom, which they said met the definition of ethnic cleansing. When preview clips of the film started circulating on social media, Modi's BJP government acted, preemptively banning the BBC series and forbidding the sharing of it online. In this day and age, it is like a fool's errand to try and stop the circulation of something like a documentary. And I think the desire to control the terms of the debate has led to the ban, which in my view is entirely counterproductive, not just because bans never work, but also it is quite damaging for India's international image as a multicultural liberal democracy. If you look at the print media, it has been rather critical of the way the government has decided to clamp down on the documentary. But the television media trashed the BBC in every which way. The BBC, Rahul, is a methane spewing landfill of lies, fraud and selectivity. And every now and then, the methane self-combusts and the putrid smell is all pervasive. And the BBC, because it is not just Western, but also British part of the empire, you know, a colonial mindset is a term. I find it disappointing as an Indian and a young Indian to see our old colonial rulers still trying to dabble in this country. Is it a disproportionate response? Of course it is. When things are banned, when you block access to certain things, public curiosity rises. So Indians are relying on pirate sites, surreptitiously sharing links. When students in New Delhi set up a screening at their university, the authorities cut off the electricity. We contacted multiple government officials, as well as pro-BJP voices in the media requesting interviews. None of them agreed. Some people have been accusing you of... The BBC series also explores the approach Prime Minister Modi has taken with the Indian news media, starting with what he said about that in 2002. Do you think there's anything that you should have done differently? Yes. One area where I was very, very weak, and that was how to handle the media. Since becoming Prime Minister in 2014, Modi has made up for lost time. His BJP government has been heavy-handed with the Indian media and voices of dissent. Most of the country's hundreds of news channels do not need policing. Many echo Modi's brand of Hindu nationalism, usually at the expense of Muslims. Print and online journalists, who are more balanced, have it tougher, routinely facing harassment, intimidation, and sometimes legal charges and jail terms. Reporters are mindful of the red lines, and many news outlets have grown dependent on government ad revenues for survival. Under Modi's prime ministership, India has fallen to 150th out of the 180 countries on the Reporters Without Borders World Press Freedom Index. According to the NGO, there are autocracies that have better freedom of the press than Narendra Modi's India, which calls itself the world's largest democracy. Mr Modi has not held a single press conference since he has been prime minister. He doesn't occasionally sit down with a chosen journalist. That's more about his personality rather than about politics. And then you have the story of the Indian media itself. The Indian media have undergone a tremendous shift in the last 10 years or so, where political debate on the media seems very one-sided. The Indian media depends very heavily on government advertising. You pick up a newspaper in the capital, and the first four pages will be government ads. Either the prime minister or a state chief minister beaming down at you from what should be the front page. And this obviously puts pressure on editorial positions. The government has used all kinds of methods, including enforcement directorate raids, including intimidation of critics, activists, academics, including imprisonment of journalists. This is a cross-the-board method. And it has resulted in a kind of media climate in which they don't have to do all that much. Before people will back down themselves. But when they don't back down, the government does not shy away from coming down very hard. And the government is making legal changes to allow for more of that. Through one of the laws it's using to force social media companies to take down links to the BBC series, the Information Technology Rules Act. The changes will bar those platforms from hosting any information the authorities identify as false. The Editors Guild of India, which presumably doesn't have a colonial mindset, says the amended law will stifle legitimate criticism and the ability of the press to hold governments to account. And that was how to handle the media. Two decades ago, Narendra Modi provided a strong hint of what his approach to the Indian media would be. And now he has all those news channels helping him and the BJP divide the country, pitting Hindus against Muslims. Indians have seen this before, in 2002, but not on a national scale, with so many more media outlets involved. BJP's MO, this is what they do, this is their way of winning elections, is to polarise the country along religious lines. The Home Minister, Amit Shah, said in an election rally in Gujarat last year that those who were taught a lesson in 2002 will never do it again, or words to that effect. That is an admission of what happened in 2002, that there was a deliberate intent to teach a lesson to Muslims. And it works electorally for the BJP because many people who want to see this happen will rally behind it. To the United Kingdom now, where two investigations have pulled back the curtain on libel lawyers in London and how they have helped one of Vladimir Putin's key allies to go after his critics, including journalists, in the British courts. Tarak Nafa has been following the story. Yevgeny Progozhin runs a mercenary group called Wagner that's fighting alongside Russian forces in Ukraine. And wherever Wagner forces go, allegations of war crimes follow. In November last year, when a video surfaced appearing to show a Wagner deserter in Ukraine being killed with a sledgehammer, Progozhin called it excellent directorial work that's watchable in one sitting. Until quite recently, the oligarch denied any links to Wagner. Back in 2020, when investigative organizations like Bellingcat began to reveal those links, Progozhin faced international sanctions as a consequence. According to investigations by Open Democracy and the Financial Times, that's when Progozhin hired a London firm, Discrete Law, to pursue a libel case against Bellingcat's director Elliot Higgins. Discrete Law was licensed, approved by the UK government to do that work. The libel case was dropped after Russia invaded Ukraine. Progozhin eventually admitted he was the man behind Wagner, and Bellingcat's journalism was proven accurate. Which raises serious questions. Why was a sanctioned warlord given the UK government's approval to abuse the court system in a legal attack on a journalist, what Higgins calls an act of revenge by Progozhin? One MP proposed his own piece of legislation this week aimed at the slaps culture in London, what he called a form of legal gangsterism. Thanks Tardoch. Staying with the United Kingdom now, which is in a state of political disarray, having gone through three prime ministers in the past six months and counting, with citizens dealing with a cost of living crunch. That has fueled a wave of work stoppages that has put trade unions and the news media's treatment of them into the spotlight. As successive strikes have hit rail networks, influential right-wing newspapers, including those owned by Rupert Murdoch, have sided with the paymasters, the government, vilifying the union for travel disruptions. Then came a series of hostile interviews with the union's leader, Nick Lynch. But Lynch has turned the tables, putting journalists on the defensive over their habitual anti-union approach. Combative exchanges have gone viral, boosting public support for striking workers and exposing the kind of journalistic animosity that has undermined the UK's working classes for decades. The listening posts, Daniel Tury now on the coverage of labour issues in the British news media. More than 100,000 Royal Mail postal workers have gone on strike in a dispute over pay. We're in an unprecedented moment in British politics. For the first time in 40 years, we're having a significant burst of inflation. Workers at the country's largest container shipping port, Feelecstoke, have joined the list of those on strike for more. Prices are rising by something like 10%, 12%, 13% a year. Baristers have been taking action for over a month, escalating now with a vote for all-out action. And we've been through something like 15 years of repeated squeezes on people's wages. It's the biggest train strike in over three decades. And into this moment, trade unions suddenly have this huge central significance. At the forefront of the strikes sweeping across Britain is the Rail, Maritime and Transport Union, the RMT. In June, its members walked out for the sixth time in as many months over pay and planned job cuts. For three days, much of the country's metro and rail network was at a standstill. And in the news coverage, the RMT was feeling the heat. For a lot of our viewers, you are the face of the stress, the disruption that they're going to face. And when the union's leader, Mick Lynch, hit the TV studios, the tables began to turn. Mick Lynch is someone who is prepared to take on the media in a way that we don't often see. However much the journalists try to attack him, he can stand up to it. Are you or are you not a Marxist? Because if you are a Marxist, then you're into revolution and into bringing down capitalism. Richard, you do come up with the most remarkable twaddle sometimes. His technique is very much to question the questioner. Does it look like the miners' shrine? What are you talking about? No, it doesn't, Mr Lynch. I'm just asking. I'm just a clarifying. Richard got off into the world of the surreal. It's very rare for a trade union leader to be able to stand up to media pressure. The way a TV interview used to go with a trading leader is a trading leader would turn up in the studio and would basically be bullied by a TV presenter. You see the marginalised role of trade unions in many areas of life. You're a dinosaur. Well, you know, at the end of the day, that was around for a long while. You watch Mick Lynch do a TV interview. A TV presenter might have one or two facts and Mick Lynch knows the book on his own dispute, but interestingly, what he's doing is he's talking directly past the interviewer to the public. Because people can't take it anymore. You've got people who are doing full-time jobs who are having to take state benefits and use food banks. That is a national disgrace. He's making clear that the dispute has got something to do with everyone sat at home watching this interview. It's a sort of message that really has struck a chord because of inflation. There are a lot of frightened people in this country and they see at last here's a union leader who can stand up for them in the media and they like it. By the time the rail strike was ending and Mick Lynch was done sparring with the media, something highly unusual had happened. Public opinion had swung behind the RMT. But it wasn't enough to force the government and the rail companies it owns to offer a deal. Industrial disputes take time and in the past, hostile news coverage has helped to break strikes much larger than the RMTs. Good evening. A critical week for the miners' strike. Will it flare up into an all-out war between the unions and the government or will it fizzle out? In the 1980s, the Conservative Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher privatised British industries and took on trade unions that stood in her way. The coal miners' union led by Arthur Scargill was among the largest and most militant and when they went on strike, Thatcher made an example of them. In the year-long nationwide dispute that followed, the media would play a pivotal role, starting with Thatcher's allies in the press. The trade unions were operating in the 1980s against a back cloth of an unsympathetic press and that's putting it mildly. The interests of the owners of the newspapers was themselves to limit the power of the trade unions before the 1980s. The print unions decided whether or not the newspapers came out and the proprietors resented that. The miners' strike was defined by battles outside coal works between strikers trying to shut down production and the police. Police officers committed the worst of the violence, sometimes unprovoked, but it was the violence of Scargill's strikers that dominated the headlines, producing a powerful media narrative of the miners as an angry mob and Scargill as a public enemy. What was so exceptional about the miners' strike was that we had a government that understood how to use the media. If you can use the newspapers to set up the agenda, this will also be reflected in what appears on radio and television. After two hours the police were tired of being pushed and pelted with house bricks. The pickets knew what to expect. They'd been warned it could turn nasty and it did. These were the strikers who were threatening law and order. These were the strikers who were the Marxists who wanted to bring down the government of the day. I found out that Scargill was demonised to a degree that no other union leader has in my lifetime. To a certain extent, Scargill, Arthur Scargill was his own worst enemy. To hell with an industry that can't pay higher wages. He cast himself in a very aggressive role and that enabled the press to make him out as some sort of devil incarnate who was there to try to take the country down. I look back as a broadcaster, I was with the BBC and I really realised that although I was inadvertent, I'd become almost a cheerleader for Mrs Thatcher because I was following her agenda. She was determined to get half the miners back at work and then she could declare victory, which she did, and it was done on the back of the news media. Britain's trade unions still live in the shadow cast by the Thatcher years, fenced in by some of the strictest anti-strike laws in Europe, their membership has declined by half since their peak in the late 70s. The journalists who used to cover them, industrial correspondents, have all but vanished too, replaced by business reporters or generalists like the presenters Mick Lynch has faced, who are often better at generating heat for ratings and clicks than they are at shedding light. It makes me laugh, honestly, that you have the hood as your profile picture because that's a man who wreaked havoc on the world. Well, it makes me laugh that your level of journalism has descended so far that you can't think of any other question rather than a thing about it. I'm here at the picket line for the latest rail strike in central London. It's the RMT's seventh strike so far this year and I've come here to ask Mick Lynch how he sees the British media today compared to the days of Arthur Scargill. Well, back in those days we had the newspaper media and we had a couple of channels, BBC and ITV, but what we've got now is a flourishing of outlets. There's lots of different digital channels but also the social media channels and it allows trade unionists to have more of a say. Whether it gets across or not is another way because the written media is still a very important aspect in this country. So you now have a lot more public support for your cause than you did at the time of the last strike. Do you secretly want to thank those TV presenters? Well, there's been a turn. I think what happened to those journalists, they weren't with it because they regurgitate the press releases that they get and an editorial line. It's changed actually. Some of those mainstream journalists have shown a bit more respect frankly and have been a bit more cynical about what they've been told by the government. And so we've seen a bit of a change of attitude but we still have to work hard to find our voice. Get your members motivated. Nick Lynch's handling of the UK media has given the country's trade unions a boost as they continue their strikes. But like Arthur Scargill and the miners, Lynch, the RMT and the rest of Britain's unions face a conservative government that is refusing to back down and is now threatening a new anti-union crackdown. The stage looks set for another conflict, one in which the media will again be participants as well as observers. And finally, back to India. For more on the impact the Modi government and its Hindu nationalist narrative has had on the country's news media, we'd recommend watching an episode of The Listening Post that we produced in August of last year. It's a deep dive into the rise of hate speech in the Indian media and the toxic impact that's having on the multicultural, multi-religious fabric of the country. We're leaving you now with an excerpt from that film, a sound bite about the kinds of things that get said on Indian news channels, the idea of the enemy within. You can find the full episode on our YouTube channel or via Al Jazeera's website. We'll see you next time here at The Listening Post. You have a Hindu community that the media are doing their very best to try and unite. How do they do that? Well, firstly, by positioning the sense of an external enemy, right, against whom then you're all supposed to be united. Most importantly, you don't have to look inside and ask, what actually unites all of us Hindus together? So, here you have these anchors telling people what they should think, whom they should approve of and whom they should disapprove of. And it kind of works.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 3773\n","\n","Link  191 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/xvRt7prjIQc\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/xvRt7prjIQc\n","[youtube] xvRt7prjIQc: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] xvRt7prjIQc: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 2.11MiB in 00:31\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  He has no staff, no budget, and gets no paycheck. But Nasir Ahmed Fayegh still comes to work in Afghanistan's mission to the United Nations. This was the area for our entrance. This was the office of some of the colleagues. As the Chargé d'affaires, he is now his country's highest ranking official in New York, even if the de facto Taliban government in Afghanistan doesn't recognize him. For the past 20 years, people have been suffering, and I don't want to leave my country. I don't want to leave my job. I want to stay and serve my country and my people under a legitimate government, under a government that is elected based on the people's will. It is Fayegh who represents his country in official UN meetings. A graduate of Kabul University, he describes himself as a civil servant representing his country's professional class. The Taliban has named its own spokesman to serve as ambassador to the United Nations, but so far the Credentials Committee, which consists of nine member countries, including the United States, Russia and China, has refused to consider the request. After the Taliban took control, the Security Council called for an inclusive negotiated political settlement, one that includes the participation of women. With no progress on those contentious issues, the UN has yet to recognize the de facto government. UN Secretary General Amina Mohammed says the Taliban's desire to have a representative at the United Nations was made clear when she traveled to Kabul recently, hoping to convince them to reverse bans on women working and going to school. I went into Afghanistan thinking perhaps the most conservative of them didn't care about recognition. They do. Recognition is one leverage that we have and we should hold on to it. Fayegh says he hopes to return home someday. The picture is very gloomy in the future. It's uncertain, but we are still hopeful. And that's why we are trying our best as Afghans. For now, his job in New York appears secure, even if his country's future isn't.

خلال الفترة هذه بعث لي مبلغين ماليات أولها بحيث أني أتعالج في تركيا والمرة الثالثة بعث لي بحيث نكمل إجراءات الفيزا لما عرض علي أني أخرج لبريطانيا ليتم معرض حالتي على حبيب معروف في بريطانيا وهل قام بعمل فيزا؟ في الفترة هذهكة خلاني أتواصل مع شخص سمى حاله بيير لما رن عليه كان واضح جدا من لهجته إسرائيل أو يهود ريدي أتعالج إذا سمحت إذا سمحت أنا أريد أن أتعالج بمسيح ميري هل أتعالج بمسيح الفيزا؟ أتعالج بمسيح الفيزا أنا أريد أن أتعالج أيضا مسيح ميري وشخصاً مننا ونحبه نحبه جدا كل هذه المعاملة الخاصة خاصة لك أنا أطلب منك لا تتحدث عن المعاملة لأي واحد وبعد ذلك عندما استمر هذا التواصل أولاً طلبوا مني شراء تلفونين فقط لهم غير الإيميلات والخطوطات للهاتف حتى أنك لم تستطع تدبر فنحن ندبر لك وصاروا يطلبوا دراسات وعلىها حولوا مصاري أولاً على الوستر يونيون ثم على شركة حوالات ثم عندما أصبحت المبالغ أعلى أولاً حوالي 500 دولار ثم أصلت 2300 دولار حوله فكان يبعتوني شخص يأتي ويعطينيه في اليد الطرق التي أرسلناها ليست أفضل من الوستر يونيون ربما أرسلك 1000 دولار نترك كل شهرين 3 أو 4 أرسلك 3000 دولار هل

بالتاريخ الأمور هي كلها للمنظومات السيطرة التركية أن تستطيع تركي المال موضوع المصادر المدخلين كانت مدخل مهم وقد أتعلموا أنه كان من أجل مدخل مختلف دول أوروبيين وفقاً من تسلسل هذه المساعدة كانوا مستطيعين أن تدخل ونقل عدد من الأجنب المتسلطة أجنبها ستكتب أكثر عن أدنائها من أخرين في الوطن أرى يا أخي أنا مخبرات إسرائيل قادم ومساعدتك قادميتك وقالت لهم أبو أحمد ألو نصف ساعة سأكون في المكان إن شاء الله تمام تمام صالح تامر ألمس هال أبو أحمد لتعرف أكثر عن المساعدة الأخرى أبو أحمد شخصيتك كانت وهمية وأيضا الجمعية التي قدمتمها لهم أيضاً وهمية نعم صحيح شخصيط أبو أحمد وهمية وأيضاً الجمعية كانت وهمية تحت ما يسمى جمعية الطلب المبدعين يعني أوهمتهم أن هذه جمعية تعمل في قطاع الطلاب في تركيا صحيح أنها جمعية موجودة في تركيا وتعمل مع الطلاب ولكن طبعاً على العكس هي ليست موجودة أساساً طب التواصل كيف بدأ في البداية؟ كيف عرفوا أن هذه الجمعية؟ كانوا يحاولون التواصل مع أي أشخاص لهم علاقة في العمل الطلابي في القدرة على الوصول لشريحة الخلسطينيين في تركيا فكان التواصل معهم على أن هذا الشخص في تركيا أبو أحمد هو معني في الطلاب عبر هذه الجمعية اللي هم حاولوا أن يدخلوا عليه حتى يساعدوا الطلاب يدخلوا على الناس فيها هو أن كل الطلاب في تركيا هم يتواصلون مع هذا الشخص هو أنت؟ نعم صحيح هو أبو أحمد فحتى احنا لما ترتبنا مع الشباب الطلاب موجودين أن أي تواصل يتمعك وإذا سألوكم عن أي حد مسؤول عن الطلاب أو من يقابلكم في موضوع عمل الطلابي لهذه الجمعية أن يبلغوا بإسم أبو أحمد المصادر المدخلين أخذوا هذه المساعدة وبدأوا في تحديد أبو أحمد أطلبوا من أجنبهم الذين عيشوا في المكان نفسه أبو أحمد لإعلانه حتى أخذوا أحدهم من مكان آخر لتفقد المعلومات المحلقة التي أحصلت عن أبو أحمد لا تدعوا أنه كان يعمل بعمل مع المصادر المدخلين أبو أحمد وعندما أتواصلوا معهم بعدما سألوا عن مان المعنى في هذه الأعمال في تركيا أخبرواهم بأنه أبو أحمد مباشرة بعد هذا الأخبار كفقوا على ذلك وإرسلوا له مبلغ 700 دولار أمريكي في الوقت المصادر أصبحت ملابساتهم إسمها ألسواوك تحديات المصادر لحاول أن تتحقق المصادر حيث لا توجد اكتشاف مصادر إلى بالنسبة إلى관وان الذي استخدموا في التواصل قالوا إنها جمعية موجودة في بلجيكا في بروكسل نعم في منطقة بروكسل أرسلتم أحد للتأكد من أن هذه الجمعية حقيقة أم لا ذهب أحد من طرفنا إلى بلجكا إلى بروكسل وذهب إلى العنوان نفسه ولم يجد أي جمعية هناك أصلا لم تكن موجودة هذا مثلاً هون هذا موقع اللي كانوا معتندينه بداية هذا اسم الجمعية؟ نعم السواك السواك للمساعدات الخيرية حتى قد تطلع ببديهيات المواقع حتى مش مكلفين أنفسهم يعملوا تصميم محترم بالنسبة لهذا الموقع هل مزال متاح؟ الموقع بقي متاح لحوالي السنة الماضية

التركية تلقى مرور مصدر مروره من نفس المساعدة المصادر الذي كان في موصدر مع أدنان في أبريلسيس المساعدة تعلق بأن أدنان كانت ممتنة في التعليق وكان كله بخير تفصلوا عليه لأي لأ راك تسلح لكفالة التي سأسلح له قبعنا اليوم ب-8 ندبر يمكنهم أن يتعاملوا مع المكتب من الجمهور الآخر أو ربما المنطقة لكنها تحت مرورة قوية لأي من لكن يمكنهم أن يكونوا يتعاملون مع المساعدة ربما يكونوا مجموعة منها ويمكنهم أن يسلحوا المتعامل على الأخر hand إذا كان هناك نوع من المفادلة كما هو الحال الحكومة المهمة التي تعتبرها مدينة تدريب يجب أن يبدأ التحدي إذا كان المدينة التي تدريب هذه المدينة مستقبلة أو لا إذا لم يعلنوا كل شيء وقالوا أن كل شيء كان بشكل عاد هذا يعني أن الحكومة تتحكم ألجزيرا تتواجد المكتب السويسي في إستمبول وطلبهم أن يتعاملوا بأنهم أرسلوا مزيد من المفادلة على أخر من المتعامل مع المساعدة وقالوا أن الوحيد العامل لا يتعامل عن المفادلة هناك مستقبلة أن يكون المفادلة موجودة مع المساعدة في أخر مكان لكن المساعدة في تركيا أعتقد أن أكثر من هذا أن تتعامل مع المفادلة لا يريدون أن يتعامل مع المساعدة في موصد وأن يتعامل مع المساعدة في إلتماد دائل لأنه يتعامل مع المفادلة ومن الأمور الموجودة بين إسرائيل أو بين الدول المختلفة في الدنيا تتأثر أيضا على الشور المساد إذا كان المساد يريد أن يعمل في بريطانيا أو في ألمانيا فالاسلوب هناك مختلف من نوع الشور المساد يتدعم تركيا هناك عشر مجتمع ومسالك مختلفة بين الدولتين ومسالك مختلفة بالنسبة لعلاقات إسرائيل مع تركيا ومحساسيات مختلفة ومحدودة لتركيا وإسرائيل المساعدات الأمنية التركية أطلبت من أدنى أن لا تتحرك إلى السويتسلند وقد تتطلب هل ذهبت إلى السويتسلند؟ لا لم أسأل الجهات المعنية رفضت وقطعت التواصل قالت لي قطعت التواصل وتم قطعت التواصل بالفعل من وقتها لم يحاولوا بعد ذلك الوصول إليك؟ طبعاً يحاولون بشكل دوري تقريباً لليوم؟ يعني من أخر مرة من شهرين حتى اليوم تعتقد أن ضباط المساد يعتقدون أنك مجمد لديهم؟ نعم صحيح بعد أن طلعت الجهة المختصة على الموضوع قطعت التواصل ومن ذلك الحين لم تعد للتواصل رن بعدين أقام عليه وحاول يرجع شاسمه لكن مسكين بكراءة يهلو 200 ألف هل أيقن أنه تعرض إلى لعب مضادة؟ أيقن أنه ما يقال شيء بالنهاية هو أعرف أو لا أعرف شأن ما بهمني أنه شخص

A bustling, glamorous city. But underground a different reality appears. There are many mosquitoes and bed bugs here. You see so many. I'm getting fungal infections. He has slept here for four years and looks through rubbish bins for leftover food in takeaway boxes. Official figures released in November show the number of people experiencing homelessness is the highest in a decade, and there's a sharp rise in the number of women experiencing housing insecurity. That report also said there's a need for better services and more funds for hostel accommodation as the situation worsens. This is a very wealthy city. You know, it's extremely wealthy. One in five at this moment are having food insecurity. They cannot afford three meals a day. You know, it's an amazing city where you see the haves and the have-nots and it's in your face all the time. ImpactHK is an NGO founded in 2017. So far they've helped around 500 people find shelter. They also welcome people into their community centres for hot meals and fresh clothes. Over 90% of those individuals have no emergency contacts. They have no friend or family member in their life. And that isolation plays a huge role in their step towards becoming homeless. He says emergency shelters provided by the government don't address the needs of the city and are difficult for people to access. The Hong Kong government told Al Jazeera social workers give assistance to those willing to accept services. In Taikok Chui, there are more than 30 people sharing this underground space. It's the middle of winter here in Hong Kong and the temperature often drops below 10 degrees at night. People in this underpass are preparing for another night exposed to freezing conditions. Alick used to be one of them. He spent almost 20 years on the streets. Now I have a place to live. I have food to eat and a job. I'm happy and more cheerful now. Now he works in the community centre, distributing food and essentials to people sleeping outside, helping them through the same dark days he experienced during his time on the streets.

Israeli police say they're on their highest state of alert after fresh violence. They say the latest shooting in Silwan in East Jerusalem, filmed in this video, was carried out by a 13-year-old boy using a pistol. He's believed to have targeted two settlers, a father and son. Both were wounded. The 22-year-old son is said to be in a serious condition. The 13-year-old boy was also shot and was questioned by police in the ambulance on the way to hospital. It follows an attack on Friday near a synagogue in the settlement of Nevi Yaakov, also in East Jerusalem, where seven people were shot dead. A guy stopped here to help, got out of his car and got a bullet to the head and died next to me. His son got a bullet in the back. I tried to compose myself. I saw him right here with the gun in his hand. I saw the whites of his eyes. I looked down and went back in the house and got a bullet in the window. Police say the attacker, Haeri Alkom, aged 21, was shot dead in his car as he tried to escape from the scene. He lived in the Mount of Olives. His parents and neighbours who came to his house were arrested. 42 people in total were detained. We are here after one of the hardest attacks in recent years. I convened a situation assessment with all the security forces. We decided on several immediate actions. We have to work with determination and composure. I called on people not to take the law into their own hands, for that we have an army, police and security forces. On Thursday, Israeli forces went deep into the Jenin refugee camp, the deadliest raid since the UN started keeping records nearly two decades ago. In one day, ten Palestinians, including an elderly woman, were killed. Prime Minister Netanyahu now says there will be further action. What form it will take will probably be decided by his security cabinet, which will meet later in Tel Aviv. Near the home of the 13-year-old boy that Israeli authorities say was responsible for the latest shooting, there has been confrontation, stones have been thrown and the Israeli forces have responded with stun grenades and tear gas. Things here feel as though they are balanced on a knife edge. Earlier on, we watched two young Palestinians who were briefly detained by Israeli police and then subjected to a heavy-handed search. We saw one of them being beaten, but the officers tried to stop us filming and a settler then berated and pushed our cameraman.

Modi knows that we have very vivid memories. This wasn't like people in masks. This violence, people weren't hiding. What really haunted me as a young man watching this violence was the organization and the precision. And what really haunted me about the violence, especially now as a new father, the sight of a young Hindu man holding a baby, attacking Muslims. For the international community, I would say, dig up that evidence. Hold that in front of the Indian government and say, now hold on a second. But another thing too to the international community is also to believe Muslims. Muslims, we've been speaking about this for quite some time but we haven't been believed. What international pressure will do, it would force Modi to do what he fears most, which is when he shows up to his international symposiums or meetings, he's constantly being asked about 2002. Because the line of inquiry would be, 2002 is not an event in the past. 2002 is very much a part of 2023. But when we have this narrative that 2002, oh, it's in the past, Modi changed, the violence was short-lived, no, 2002 has continued on today. Modi continues to keep this violence alive. He needs it. It's part of his survival because he has failed to deliver economically. Cruelty is the point. It's not like a byproduct. I mean, cruelty is the point of his administration. It is impossible to ignore what India has become. And it is impossible to ignore how India is so dangerously close to ethnically cleansing its Muslims. If there's not foreign intervention, I think what we're going to see is wide-scale violence on a level that will make 2002 pale in comparison. Now, will it be gas chambers and camps? I don't think so. But we're already seeing the ethnic cleansing of Muslims. What I mean to say is Muslims are pushed into ghettos, names of cities are changed, names of buildings are changed, Muslims are using fake names. I think what we'll see is the Muslim population dwindle. Now it's a huge population. And I think what I fear is there'll be some ghastly event. And then only then will the international community really wake up. I still remember the face of that father with the toddler. I have pain from witnessing the violence. There's no question. But I have a lot of pain from not being believed for so long.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 413\n","\n","Link  196 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/eVetSoef4m4\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/eVetSoef4m4\n","[youtube] eVetSoef4m4: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] eVetSoef4m4: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 23.23MiB in 04:45\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Hello I'm Marlene Sayeed. This is Counting the Cost on Al Jazeera. This week from the coronavirus pandemic to the war in Ukraine crisis upon crisis threatens to fracture the global economy. After decades of integration is globalization breaking down. Or is it transforming. Also this week the wealth richest 1 percent pocketed nearly twice as much wealth as everyone else over the last two years. So how can the yearning inequality gap be bridged. And Sweden discovers the largest deposit of rare metals in Europe. We explore if this could help reduce the continent's dependence on China. The end of the Cold War free trade and technological advances have all helped create a global system that is acutely sensitive to what is happening on the other side of the world. Globalization has been credited for developing economies increasing incomes and lifting millions of people out of poverty. The pandemic and the war in Ukraine has exposed the fragility of that economic interdependence. Europe has reduced its reliance on Russian fossil fuels and cut off Moscow from the West financial system. The US is in a trade war with China. Protectionism is on the rise and companies are moving supply chains closer to home. The perfect storm of events is putting the world's economic order at risk. The International Monetary Fund warns that declining international cooperation could shrink global output by up to 7 percent. The issue was high on the agenda. The World Economic Forum in Davos where the UN Secretary General had some advice for the US and China. We risk what I've called a great fracture. The decoupling of the world's two largest economies. The tectonic drift that would create two different sets of trade rules to dominant currencies to Internet and to conflicting strategies artificial intelligence. This is the last thing we need. So are we seeing the demise of globalization. The percentage of trade that makes up global GDP is one important measure. Let's take a look at this chart. As you can see it peaked nearly 60 percent in 2008. Exports as a share of global output have been flat or lower since the financial crisis. They dipped sharply during the pandemic in 2020 but then they rose again in 2021 to almost 57 percent of global GDP and trade hit a record 28 and a half trillion dollars that year. To unpack all of that I'm joined now by Simon Evenette from Geneva. Simon is a professor of international trade and economic development at the University of Saint Gallen. Thank you for joining the program Simon. Are we seeing the demise of globalization. We're not seeing the demise of globalization. What you're seeing is it's kind of like a runner going from a sprint to a jog. Essentially we're seeing a deceleration in the growth along some dimensions but still a massive surge especially in digitally digitally delivered services. That's growing like the clappers. But do you think the benefits of globalization outweigh the geopolitical problems that we've seen that it's helped create. On that yes the benefits of globalization have been enormous. Just talk to the millions or hundreds of millions of Asians who've been lifted out of poverty as a result of the growth of the last 30 years. There has been dislocation especially in those Western countries that have been unable to retrain their labor forces or didn't educate them properly in the first place. So there is a problem there. As for the geopolitics yes there are some supply chains where you can find sort of critical materials in a small number of locations. But actually as people have looked into those the number of those cases are far fewer than you would often think if you if you listen to some of the commentary data does show that protectionist trade policies have been growing faster than liberalizing ones in recent years. Is the idea of free trade or trade without constraints finished. I think you are right to cite the work that my team has done on collecting that information. What we are seeing is governments I think thinking again about full throttle globalization not necessarily doing it in an unquestioned manner. Some of them have been enacting especially the big players very strategically over the past decade or so using protectionist tools. So yeah governments globalisation has become a lot messier. But I still think it's the baseline against which policy is ultimately judged. Do you think it's gone too far. Has globalisation gone too far. I would say no actually. I think there's plenty of room for going further with globalisation. But it would again. This will only ever happen if it is managed well internally. A lot of the problems we have with the backlash against globalisation is because people are fearful of losing their jobs and they don't think they're going to get a suitable job afterwards or get rehired. So we've got to find ways to support people as they transition. And in countries that do this rather well mainly the ones in northern Europe countries like Denmark there's a lot more support for globalisation. I think that's the real lesson. But if we don't get our domestic labour markets sorted out then yes there's going to be a constraint on how far globalisation will go in the future. You touched briefly on the vulnerabilities we've seen in supply chains as a result of the war in Ukraine. Covid as well. One example is the shortage of medicine that we're currently seeing in Europe. The World Trade Organisation has said that re globalisation is the answer. What exactly is re globalisation. And is that the future. So I think what the World Trade Organisation is trying to advocate here is thinking of ways in which you can use globalisation to diversify supply chains and limit the risk of being dependent on any one supplier. And I think the risk management perspective is a really smart way of looking at this because no country should be dependent on any one sort of set small set of supplies even including domestic suppliers who sometimes fall down on the job. And so I think to the extent that re globalisation is really better risk management and better diversified sourcing that makes a lot of sense. China of course one of the biggest beneficiaries of globalisation. But things have changed a lot in recent years. It's now locked in a trade war with the United States. Where do you see its relationship with the United States going. Could we see a two parallel supply chain system. The US China relationship is very fraught at the moment. I think we are beginning to see some attempt to try and define what President Biden calls boundaries or to the competition between these countries. We have to hope that process goes forward. But it has been a rocky five or 10 years between between them. And to the extent that both the United States and China decide that they want to change their sourcing patterns maybe being less global or more regional then you are going to see companies adjust. So I think that is that is potentially on the table with a lot more regionalisation of supply chains. And by the way I think a lot of the private sector is already moving in that direction. We're beginning to see that in some sectors. Are we transitioning do you think into a new economic order which is no longer dollar denominated. We are transitioning away from the globalisation economic order of the 1990s. What we're going towards is still unclear. I don't buy the argument that we're splitting into two blocks. There will definitely be a Western block probably centred around the United States and a number of English speaking nations possibly with the European Union in there. But then when you turn to the large emerging markets although they're pretty clear that they don't want to be part of the Western block it's not clear that those non-Western countries cooperate much together. So if anything I think we're going up in a pretty situation where there's a lot of fuzzy blocks between the emerging markets and maybe a Western core. So in that sense it's going to be pretty messy going forward. I think the idea that we're going to have two rigid blocks like we saw during the Cold War goes too far. It won't be that easy. A final word. What do you think the consequences of de globalization are. I mean can't can the world's economies actually survive independently. I think the consequences of de globalization are going to be very severe for the cost of producing a number of goods. So we have benefited enormously from having large production runs by concentrating production in maybe a small number of places for different types of commodities. If you start chopping up those supply chains and you end up firms with much smaller production runs unit costs will be higher. Prices will be higher. Inflation will be higher. So this will step. And I think we will see a hit to our living standards if we move towards de globalization. And this is the part of the story which the advocates of de globalization are not sharing with that with the public. Absolutely fascinating to talk to you. Simon Everett from Geneva professor of international trade and economic development at the University of St. Gallant. Thank you. Thank you. Well while globalization is credited for lifting millions of people out of poverty it's also been criticized for increasing inequality and the world's billionaires have been racking up more wealth than everyone else over the past two years. Oxfam says that the wealthiest one percent amassed more than 40 trillion dollars in new wealth during that period. That's almost twice as much as the rest of the world combined. Oxfam says the fortunes of the wealthiest one percent of the population increased two point seven billion dollars each day. A billionaire and around one point seven million dollars for every one dollar earned by the remaining 90 percent. And for the first time in a quarter of a century extreme wealth and extreme poverty increased simultaneously. The report says at least one point seven billion employees live in countries where inflation is outpacing wage growth causing hundreds of millions of people to go hungry. Oxfam is calling for higher taxes for the rich. It says a five percent levy on the wealthy would raise about one point seven trillion dollars a year. Joining me now from London is Paul Segal a reader in economics of development at the Department of International Development of King's College London. Thank you for joining the show. So we've been discussing globalization in this show. How much is it to be blamed for the wealth inequality gap. Well globalization is a complex one. I mean it's certainly true that people who are at the very top of the wealth distribution have benefited a lot from the mobility of capital and the ability of of firms to to invest across countries and and trade across countries and increasing rate over the last several decades. But globalization has also been pretty key in raising a lot of incomes at the bottom of the global income distribution. So countries like China and India that a few decades ago had very high levels of poverty they've seen very rapid growth and including very rapid growth lower down the income distribution meaning globalization has been key to reducing poverty and therefore helping to mediate some extent the rise in inequality at the same time. So what is the reason behind this massive growth in wealth. We're seeing the super rich. Why did the rich always become richer. So there's a there's a long run story and a short run story. So the long run story is that over the past four decades or so taxes on the very rich have gone down dramatically. And that means that the very rich have been able to increase their share of the pie. So as we've had global growth of the past several decades the rich have been taking an increasing share of that pie at the expense of everyone else. So that's a long run story. But then there's also the short run story of the last two or three years caused by the COVID pandemic. And then what we had was governments injected very large amounts of money into the economy in order to stimulate the economy in order to reduce the recessionary effects of the COVID pandemic. Now that was an important thing to do. Governments needed to do that to support the economy to support people's incomes. But if you like a side effect of that was that it massively inflated asset prices which meant that it massively inflated the wealth of those people who own the assets which is of course predominantly very wealthy. So there's a disproportionate effect increasing the wealth of the very rich which means now be a particularly opportune time as people are arguing to tax back some of that wealth in order to fund some of the public services that we so desperately need at this time. And where do you see this wealth gap going. I mean of course a lot of people struggling with high prices with inflation. There's the war in Ukraine. What impact is that going to have on that wealth gap. So the war in Ukraine it's led to a spike in prices of things like energy and foods. And those of course feature much more heavily in the budgets the household budgets of people lower down income distribution. Poor and middle class households spend a much higher share of their income on food and energy than do the very rich. So that increase in prices is certainly increasing inequality at the moment. Now as we see that subside hopefully well we don't know what's going to happen with the war but hopefully those prices will start to come down over the next year or two. And to some extent we might see a partial reversal of that. That's what I'm hopeful for. But of course we can't know until it happens. Has any progress been made at all in tackling inequality. I would say a very interesting case here is a case of China. China had a very rapid rise in inequality after opening up in the late 1970s and 1980s as part of its rapid growth model. Certain regions in particular grew very fast whereas others stagnated. And that meant that there's been a rapid rise in inequality in China until a little bit after 2000 until the early 2000s. Since then China has been quite successful in increasing social spending on poorer sectors of society which has had a big difference. But also the key lesson I think that a lot of the world can learn from China is that China invested a lot in its poorer regions. So it took kind of a developmentalist approach to its poorer areas to increase their productivity and through that to increase the wages of of workers in poorer regions. And that's been highly successful in stabilizing and maybe even reducing inequality in China. And also more generally around the world we see there's an increased movement towards stronger or there's public pressure let's say towards stronger trade unions. There's a lot of labor activism and historically labor activism has been one of the key drivers of reducing inequality. So if we support that and if governments are willing to support increased stronger trade unions increased labor activism and simple policies like raising minimum wages those have been those policies have been proven to reduce inequality historically and they can do it again if there's political will. You touched on tax. We've heard from Oxfam and others at Davos calling for taxes on the super rich. It's not a new idea but many governments have resisted it. Why. The simple reason is that billionaires and other very wealthy people tend to lobby governments to persuade them not to do it. I mean they're always inviting senior politicians to parties on their yachts. We know that happens. It's well documented. It's not even surprised to hear it. But it's not that we shouldn't be surprised either that after they come back from those parties on yachts they're feeling rather more friendly towards those billionaires and and don't feel inclined to implement policies that are likely to compromise their interests. But actually goes deeper than that. And the bigger problem we have is not just billionaires direct access to politicians but the fact that most of our mainstream media is dominated by billionaire owners. So they are very able and do it all the time to get their media outlets to essentially promulgate their interests to promulgate arguments that are in favor of their interests. And even when you have a very popular policy like a wealth tax on the very rich would be extremely popular. The mainstream media don't cover it or they they diminish it because they owned the media outlets themselves are owned by billionaires whose interests these policies would compromise. So do you think taxing the rich or taxing the big corporations is the solution in bridging that inequality. It's definitely a big part of the solution. I mean the rich have a have a very increased share of the pie compared to 40 years ago. And and that means that simple redistribution simply taking money from those who have excessive amounts of it and redistributing redistributing it to others especially via public services and public investment that helps boost productivity and well-being throughout the economy. That's certainly a large part of of the strategy we should be pursuing to reduce inequality. Really good to talk to you. Paul Segal reading economics of development at the Department of International Development at King's College London. Thank you. Thank you. They are found in phones TVs computers and batteries rare minerals are an essential component of everyday products. Despite their name the 17 heavy metals are found in abundance in many parts of the world. But mining and extracting them is costly and harmful to the environment. China dominates the market and no rare earth elements are mined at all in Europe. The discovery in Sweden is hoping to change the continent's fortunes. A Swedish state owned mining company says it's discovered Europe's largest deposit of the minerals. The firm LK AB announced it's found more than a million tons of rare earth oxides in Karuna in the north. The US has increased investment in rare earths to rival China's dominance of the market. I'm joined now by Nabil Manchery from Louvain in Belgium. He is the executive officer and secretary general at the Global Rare Earth Industry Association. Thank you for joining the program. Mr. Manchery how significant is Sweden's discovery of rare earth by numbers. It's quite significant but we still need to see you know how how much time it takes to develop that mine and what is the quality of that mine or and how much rather element actually is there in a recoverable form. And also as you know that there are 17 elements within this rare earth group and how many of the valuable rare earths like you know ND, Neodymium, Praseodymium, Turbium and Disposium are in that deposit which is necessary for the you know for the high performance magnets which are used in modern technologies you know like our laptops mobile phones you know wind energy turbines and electric cars. So still a lot of works needs to be done to identify how economical would be this deposit to be mined. And what kind of time frame are we looking at for getting these rare earth materials into the market. The company itself says you know it takes you know 15 years at least to develop this deposit into a fully operational mine. And that's true for many you know any mining project takes long time to develop. And we see now OK we have the material now 15 to 20 years is not bad because the demand we foresee in next 25 years. So there are projects that get ready by this time when there is a huge surge in demand. Demand is actually going up. So it's a reasonable time that you know all these deposit get ready for the future demand. We talked about the potential harm to the environment in getting it out of the ground. But it's also very important for the future in terms of green energy isn't it. How do you get that balance right. I know it's a misconstruction in the general press that your mining is harmful especially mining is harmful. It's not the case. You know it's you know in some examples you have that you know mining has caused some environmental problems in countries in Asia or Myanmar. But countries like a Western country like Sweden it can be sustainably mined and produced and processed. And you said this is very important. This is called industrial vitamins. Now you don't need huge quantities like copper or aluminium. You need tiny quantities of these elements which is necessary for you know for the energy transition. If we are going to drive the electric cars in all over the world and if you if you are producing the wind energy you know new energies without carbon emissions these are the ingredients that you need to have. We know that Europe has been aiming to reduce its reliance on China when it comes to these kind of rare earth materials. We know the US wants to rival Beijing's dominance. Where do you see the market dynamics going. China has been working and China got a good deposit of these elements. And it has been working last 30 years tirelessly to develop and move in the value chain. And actually China didn't take away this from you know Western countries. Actually we gave it like any other industry because of the of the cost structure. So we gave you know all that thing to the developing world. And then then as there are also a number of projects you know coming up in in advanced countries like Australia Canada a couple of African countries and also in South America. A part of the demand demand will be so huge that no country single handedly can manage this demand and can produce. Even China says itself you know they cannot be the factory of the world especially for these elements. And so and then the energy you know the global warming climate change is a global problem. So we have to solve it and we have to find solutions globally. And so so these kind of elements produce outside China can only meet the demand in Europe or US partially. And China will still dominate the market in these elements because they have built it. You know and they have all the capacity technology to do this. And they will they will continue to drive this market in a you know in the near future. Really good to talk to you.

After a two-year hiatus, there have been at least 11 executions, all of them for drug-related offences. He was taken away. He was hanged. That shattered me. Our state decisively and persistently murders people. In Singapore, a string of executions ignites rare protests and spirited debate over the country's zero-tolerance drug policy. More Singaporean families and individuals will be harmed if we remove the death penalty. Does Singapore really want to be known as this country that gets rid of people so easily? You want to traffic drugs that are rules-involved. If you get caught with a set amount of drugs, you get hanged. Should Singapore heed calls to rethink its drug laws, 101 East investigates. His name was Nasri bin Lajim. His son, Haikal, remembers him as a loving father. I just want to believe that he's still alive. I think it's not fair for me. But it's just the law. I can't do that. I can't change anything. Nasri was hanged last year for trafficking heroin in his home country of Singapore in 2012. He was 64 years old. His sister, Nazira, is still in mourning. My brother has been taken from me very cruelly. I know now he's gone. I miss him so much. For Nazira, these pictures of her brother taken just days before his death are both a source of comfort and pain. When I see his photo, I feel the pain and I feel so hurt. The photo shoot is a privilege, granted only to inmates about to face the gallows. Nasri is smiling here, but Nazira says his final days were difficult ones. They were only informed about the impending execution one week in advance. A last-minute appeal failed. Judges also turned down his request for more time to say goodbye to his family. There's no sympathy at all. No mercy at all. My brother is a sick man. He was addicted to drugs at the age of 14. Without that drug, he cannot control his life. And yet, he's been hanged. Nasri had been caught with more than 35 grams of pure heroin. Singapore's drug laws are among the toughest in the world. Anyone who possesses more than a certain amount of illegal drugs, such as heroin, cocaine and cannabis, is presumed to be trafficking. And if the quantity of drugs is above a prescribed threshold, the judge has to impose the mandatory death penalty. The burden to prove has been shifted to the accused person when he is in possession of the drugs. So therefore, it is a violation of the presumption of innocence, where the prosecution has to prove beyond a reasonable doubt. But the accused is now supposed to prove to the contrary. Human rights lawyer M Ravi once represented Nasri, as well as many of the inmates who are now on death row. Most of the drug traffickers are drug mules. Just look at their profile. They are very poor. They are stuck in a structural poverty. We also have a high proportion of ethnic minorities being overrepresented. Singapore has a small but vocal community of anti-death penalty activists. But campaigner Kokila Annamalai says more people are joining their cause. People have been reacting to this violent spree of executions. This is after a two-year hiatus where we didn't have any executions. It definitely caught a lot of attention because the first one was of Nagin, who was an intellectually disabled man, and that struck a chord with a lot of people. Nagendran K Dhamalingam was hanged in April 2022 for trafficking 42.7 grams of pure heroin. He had an IQ of 69, a level suggesting intellectual disability. But judges ruled that he knew what he was doing. Weeks before Nagendran's execution, hundreds of people gathered for a rare protest in Singapore. We just begged her to grant him clemency. His case drew global attention, including that of British billionaire Richard Branson and of actor and author Stephen Fry, who appeared in this video. Please grant Nagendran K Dhamalingam clemency. You were his lawyer? Yes. Lawyer M Ravi remembers his first meeting with Nagendran. It was like speaking to a child. I was asking him the first question, Nagendran, do you understand that you are going to be executed? He said he's in a garden and someone is appearing and talking to him and don't worry about death. It's like he doesn't even understand he's going to die. It's common whenever people are accused of crimes to feign ignorance, to demonstrate a lower level of awareness and maybe not be as smart as they really are. Adrian Tan is a senior lawyer with a large following on social media. His posts on the death penalty have generated heated debate. He's also head of Singapore's Law Society, but he is speaking to us today in his personal capacity. In Nagendran's case, the psychologist hired by him said that he did know what he was doing and that's really the legal test because otherwise we'll start measuring each other's IQs and we'll start seeing what line we should draw. If someone is 100, are they more culpable? What if someone's IQ is 70 and Nagendran's is 69? Where do we draw the line? On the eve of Nagendran's execution, his mother, Panchalai Supermanyam, pleaded for mercy in a last-minute appeal before the Singapore court. M Ravi was on medical leave and could not represent her son. I had to tell her that I'm unwell and they have given me a medical certificate and they don't want to wait. Because of Nagendran's intellectual disability, he wasn't able to do it. So his mother filed an application on his behalf. She doesn't speak English. She has very low education. She was extremely intimidated in court and that was the evening before his scheduled execution where she had to stand up in court and fight for his son's life and begged the court to spare his life. Nagendran was hanged the following morning. At his home town in Malaysia, hundreds of mourners gathered to say goodbye and lend support to his mother. Her appeal drew a sharp response from Singapore's Attorney General's chambers. In a media statement, it described the application as an attempt to abuse the court's processes and unjustifiably delay the carrying into effect of the lawful sentence imposed on Nagendran. It's Friday night in the Malaysian capital Kuala Lumpur and sisters Shankri and Anjaliya Prathaman have a bus to catch. It's an overnight journey they've made regularly for the past eight years. Six hours to neighbouring Singapore for a one-hour visit with their brother, Paneer. We are working on Fridays so the visit is tomorrow morning 9am. So after a long it's an immediate travelling on the nights and then returning the next day so it is tiring and exhausting. Paneer Selvan Prathaman was convicted in 2017 of trafficking 51.84 grams of pure heroin into Singapore and is now on death row. Shankri says he'd been tricked by an acquaintance he barely knew. He told Paneer that the content of this parcel is illegal medicine. It's a sex medicine. So Paneer, he didn't, he blindly trusted this person and he brought the parcel inside. But the trial judge found that Paneer's evidence was inconsistent and handed him the mandatory death penalty. He's now awaiting the outcome of his latest appeal. Yes, Paneer did mistake but he should get reasonable punishment for his mistake but not taking his life. For a time the sisters held out hope that Paneer would be re-sentenced to life imprisonment. Under Singapore law, convicted drug traffickers can avoid the death penalty if they show that they were only couriers. And if the public prosecutor certifies that they've substantively assisted authorities in disrupting drug trafficking activities. Shankri says Paneer cooperated as best he could but it wasn't enough. Because the recruiter will not provide correct and more information to the mules, they know for sure that these mules will be arrested later on. If you provide them with the information, definitely to save themselves, they will pass those information to the authorities. Shankri and Anjaliya have arrived in Singapore. They grab a quick breakfast. And then there's another bus to catch. They have to be at the prison before nine. I just prepared for him to give this book and also some letters. Did you always bring him things? Did you always bring something for him? Last week my sister brought this very thick book. We gave him this book. Oh, it's a nice big book. It's thick. This much. I still keep the receipt that we bought, all the books and all, so that we hope one day Paneer will come back and see how much we only spent on his books. People will laugh at us and ask us to prepare for the worst. So we were trying to be positive and to talk positively so that even probably God will change his mind probably and save Paneer. Singapore is one of Asia's most liveable cities. Time rates are among the lowest in the world. But it wasn't always like this. In the 70s we faced a huge drug problem. Families were being broken up because of addiction. The people took a decision to be harsh on drugs. People who bring drugs into Singapore, we will send them a clear message. The message is not just a possible death penalty but a mandatory death penalty. Singapore's government says the message has been effective. It recently released the results of a survey involving respondents from six unnamed regional cities. 83% believed the death penalty deterred people from trafficking substantial amounts of drugs into Singapore. So who are the people who are trading in amounts that are above the capital threshold? People who have less knowledge, less information and less resources. Often they're either drug users or they're people who are in precarious positions for other reasons. Bruce Matthew is a Singaporean and a recovering heroin addict who has been to prison five times but not for drug trafficking. So for those people who advocate that capital punishment is useless, it doesn't deter drug trafficking. You know, guess what? It deterred me and it deterred a lot of people that I know personally from trafficking drugs. Especially in my 40s, I was on stage. I was so tempted. I tell you, so tempted to traffic drugs. I was so broke. Two things helped me back. One, the death penalty. The second reason, my daughter. The last time I was sentenced, not only was I married, I had a daughter who was back then three years and one month old. Bruce has been clean for seven years and now spends much of his time sharing an anti-drug message with young people. He's also found new appreciation for Singapore's tough laws. My daughter can walk out in the middle of the night, cross the street to 7-Eleven to buy something and I won't even bat an eyelid because I know she will come back safe and sound. If you want to do away with strict laws, something has got to give, you know? And I am not about to give the safety of my society just because someone don't want to be hanged for trafficking drugs. No, no, no, no, no. This is not a good exchange. The government says the majority of Singapore residents hold similar views. According to a survey conducted by the Ministry of Home Affairs, 65.6% agree or strongly agree that the mandatory death penalty is an appropriate punishment for trafficking a significant amount of drugs. But anti-death penalty campaigners point to a different survey on the same issue. A survey done by the National University of Singapore a few years ago in consultation with a renowned criminologist, Professor Roger Hood, shows that when it comes to drug trafficking cases, when given the correct information and background circumstances in which these accused persons commit the crime, a large majority of the respondents are opposed to the death penalty. So the state doing its own service to justify its own arguments is strange. Drug traffickers we see as people who are making money by destroying your lives. Singapore's Law and Home Affairs Minister, K Shanmugam, has been on various platforms explaining his government's position. Are these deterrents effective when the individuals who succumb to or end up being the traffickers right, more often than not they are from the lower income groups? If I were to say in Singapore, if you are poor and desperate, then we won't impose the death penalty. Anybody else, yes death penalty, but if you are poor and desperate, no death penalty. What do you think will happen? Everyone who comes in will say he's poor and desperate, right? We have to be tough on drugs, but the complete picture... In parliament, Shanmugam drew a distinction between drug traffickers and drug abusers. We are tough on those that we need to be tough on. The drug traffickers. But for example, drug abusers, we try to not even treat them as criminals. We instead treat their drug dependency through a variety of means. Most of the people I know are still relapsing. The Singapore government and its main drug enforcement agency, the Central Nargotics Bureau or CNB, declined our requests for interviews. So to better understand the state's rehabilitation program, we spoke to people who have experienced it. Those who agreed to be filmed asked that we disguise their identity. Dee was still a teenager when she tested positive for ecstasy following a police raid. She spent six months at the Drug Rehabilitation Centre or DRC. I was not an addict. I was a 19-year-old girl who had some serious problems and liked to distract herself. The whole experience was really dehumanising. We were given these numbers and never referred to by our human names. When I got into DRC, it was the biggest shock of my life. The living condition, the treatment of inmates. Jay Wai has been to DRC multiple times. This incarceration of six months, what they do is basically just to lock you up, feed you and maybe let you attend some courses. It sounds like a rehab centre. That's what they call it. Nobody said they would be treated as a prisoner. Simon says he wasn't an addict but might have been tempted to become one during his time in DRC. Because inside there, you are able to meet people with contacts. You have your suppliers, your runners, the whole thing. You get even more into the whole scene. It's very difficult to stop that cycle because you have even more contacts now. It's more available to you. The strategy that they taught us was just complete avoidance. Just don't go back to any of the places that you went to before. Just cut yourself off from everyone that you knew before and that will fix everything. It's just not realistic. You don't know what the officers will do to you. There's a fear of even speaking out. But let's say over the years, I do see slight improvement. There are more counseling programmes, there are more activities for inmates, there is more welfare. But I don't think it's enough. Dr Munidasa Winslow is an expert in addiction and impulse control disorders. Given principles and the desire to do the right thing by science and all that in Singapore, we should be the best at helping people with recovery. We should be the best in the world. But there are certain impediments at the moment to getting well. We have basically said, stop using, stay in prison or DRC or jail long enough and then go out and get a job and then you'll be all well. Dr Winslow prefers a gentler approach to rehabilitation. But it's an option that is still largely unavailable to those who cannot afford to pay. The people who are rich can access treatment programmes that provide a lot more care. But people who do not have resources then are stuck. The person who is going to cane you or going to catch you or put you into an incarceration context, you're unlikely to seek help from. You need to separate out those services. Sharifa Syed Zin remembers her brother's struggle with drug addiction. I think maybe it all started after our mother passed away. He was 16, I was 18. So I think it was too soon for her to go. It's his own way of maybe internally trying to get over the grief. Maybe had it been that when he was in DRC, he was given the help that he needed to kill the habit, then maybe he wouldn't be in this predicament right now. Syed Suhail Bin Syed Zin was handed the mandatory death penalty in 2015 for trafficking 38.84 grams of pure heroin. He said the drugs were for personal consumption, but judges were not convinced. Syed was scheduled to hang in February 2020. But he has had two stays of execution because of applications made by M. Ravi. Besides, Suhail had a serious addiction problem. Drug addiction is an illness. That's what the psychiatrists are saying. It's a mental illness. It's a mental condition. So they have to be treated, not killed. Sharifa is hoping for the best for her brother. She's also started speaking up for the dozens of other drug offenders on death row with him. We don't know when we're going to go. So the idea that the government can decide when you're going to go is so unacceptable that they think they can play God. With more executions expected soon, more Singaporeans will be confronting the issue of capital punishment and its role in their country. The conclusions they draw will be a reflection of what they value for themselves and their society. We have to step back from our personal views and respect the community's views. The majority of Singaporeans feel that this is their country. It's a safe place if it ain't broke. And don't fix it. If we chopped off people's hands with less people's steel, perhaps, shall we do it? What kind of society do we want to be? What are we willing to live with? I don't believe that I'm safe in a society that is willing to kill. That is what makes me feel unsafe.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 3085\n","\n","Link  198 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/hEuk0-HntLU\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/hEuk0-HntLU\n","[youtube] hEuk0-HntLU: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] hEuk0-HntLU: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 23.15MiB in 05:09\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Bangladesh's Prime Minister faces calls to resign. Opposition supporters demand a caretaker government oversees elections at the end of next year. What's triggered these protests and is a political rivalry stretching back decades eroding democratic freedoms? This is Inside Story. Hello there and welcome to the programme. I'm Laura Kyle. The main opposition party in Bangladesh has been holding anti-government protests for months. Witnesses say up to 100,000 people turned up to the latest BNP rally in the capital Dhaka on Saturday. A poor economy rising food and fuel prices and power cuts appear to have galvanized longstanding anger at the prime minister. The protesters want Sheikha Sinha to step down and to make way for a caretaker government ahead of elections due next year. All seven MPs from the BNP have resigned. Police stormed the BNP's headquarters earlier this week and at least one person was killed and hundreds of opposition activists were arrested. We'll bring in our guests in just a moment. First, this report from Tanvir Chowdhury in Dhaka. During the past few months, the government has clamped down on the opposition Bangladesh Nationalist Party. Several people have been shot dead by police, hundreds injured and thousands have been arrested at rallies across the country. But it didn't stop tens of thousands of opposition supporters from gathering in Dhaka on Saturday. People don't have any security here. They don't have the right to vote and they're scared to venture outdoors because of repression. We demand the autocratic government resign immediately. We want this government to resign and release former Prime Minister Khalid Aziz. We want real democracy. On Wednesday, shortly after an interview with Al Jazeera, the party's leader, Fakhrul Islam, was arrested along with 500 supporters. Bangladesh is unfortunately facing one of the most severe political crisis now because the people of this country are being deprived of their voting rights. Democracy is totally absent now in Bangladesh. Unfortunately, the whole scenario is that just an authoritarian government is ruling this country. The UN and the US have condemned the violence and called for an investigation, while 12 advocacy groups and rights watchdogs have issued a joint statement expressing concerns about gross human rights violations. In a statement, Amnesty International has accused the government of having, quote, very little regard for human life, saying its actions send a chilling message to those who dare exercise their human rights. For its part, the government accuses the opposition of trying to destabilize the country. It says protesters are gathering illegally. Under no circumstances should there be any disturbance on the roads. People don't want it, nor do we want any unruly incidents by blocking roads. It has also rejected demands for an election-time caretaker government. Security is heavily beefed up all across the capital city, Dhaka, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party. The main opposition party's headquarter is totally cornered by police. No one is allowed in the perimeter. As the economy spirals and the cost of living soars, Bangladesh now faces the additional challenge of growing calls for regime change ahead of the next general elections. Tanvir Chaudhry, Al Jazeera, Dhaka. So how did we get here? Well, Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina has had a long rivalry with BNP leader and former Prime Minister Khalid Aziz, dating back to the 1990s. In 2018, Zia was jailed in a corruption case, her supporters say was politically motivated. Hasina has headed the Awami League party that's been in power since 2009. A caretaker government act introduced in the 90s to oversee national elections was nullified under her rule. And there have been two national elections under Hasina marred by opposition boycotts and allegations of fraud. Well, let's bring in our guests now. And in Dhaka, we have Ramin Fahana. She's one of the seven BNP members of parliament who resigned on Saturday. Also in Dhaka, Tanvir Shaqil Joy, member of parliament for the governing Awami League party. And in the town of Normal in Illinois, Ali Riaz, president of the American Institute of Bangladesh Studies at the Illinois State University. A very warm welcome to all of you. Ramin, let's start with you. Why have you and all six other BNP members of parliament quit? Thank you so much. Thank you so much for inviting me. You know, this government is not elected in 2018. This election is called midnight election because it is it is it's created history, in fact, because no other country in the world has this sort of election. So we seven members, we were in the parliament with the decision of our party. And our party made this decision because we tried to use as much as we can the platform of parliament. And we tried. We tried our level best. But unfortunately, we were not given time, proper time. Our mic has been stopped by the speaker. And this is the time I believe that this decision resonate with the people of Bangladesh. The people of Bangladesh expected us to step down from the parliament and we did so. You say that the elections in 2018 were not valid. So in the last four years, what efforts have you been making whilst you've been in parliament? What are the efforts that have failed? You you must know that in last few years we were under tremendous oppression. Our chairperson is actually in jail for two and a half years and now she's house arrest. Our acting chairman is not allowed to come back to Bangladesh. Our secretary general is now in jail. Loads and lots of cases have been filed against our activists and our members and our supporters. So we are going through a very, very tough time. In fact, Bangladesh is going through a very tough time. There is no democracy. There is no freedom of speech. There is no freedom of expression. Digital Security Act is there. So there is fear, psychosis everywhere. In last four and a half years, we tried to reorganize ourselves and I think now we are on our feet and we are ready to lose now. OK, we'll come back to that in just a moment. Tanvir Shaikhil, first of all, let's get your response. The government's response to the quitting of all of the Bangladesh National Party MPs, they feel silenced. What's the government say about that? Thanks for having me on the show. First of all, my question is that like as they are saying that the government is not legitimate and the parliament is not legitimate, then what they were doing in this parliament for last four years, you know, they were attending the parliament session. They took all the benefits as a parliamentarians. And as it was accused that they were not given time, it's actually not true at all because they were given much, much more time than government lawmakers at the parliament. And in every bill that was passed in the parliament, they were given more than equal chances to give their inputs in those laws and bills. And many of their recommendations were included in the laws and bills. So we can say that they had ample chances to say their grievances, to criticize the government, whatever opinions they had. But unfortunately, when DNP was in power from 2001 to 2006, our military lawmakers, they did not have many chances in the parliament. I just want to say one incident in 2004, there was a ghastly grenade attack on now Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina. And during that time, she nearly escaped. And when she went back to parliament, that time she was the opposition leader. She wanted to discuss this matter. She was not even given the chance to discuss this matter on the parliament. OK, all right. What Rumi is saying that she has been there, she says yes, for the last four years, but she has tried to make a difference in the parliament, but those efforts have failed. I think the point that I mostly picked up on is that the BNP leader is in jail, currently now under house arrest. That's Khalidah Zia. BNP leaders were arrested ahead of the Saturday protests. There have been 2000 people, others, arrested ahead of all these protests. Many BNP members have also been abducted, disappeared, not to mention hundreds of extrajudicial killings. There is a silencing of the opposition, is there not? No, I don't agree with that. First of all, as I was mentioning, they were given ample chances and they took all the privileges that parliamentarians got and they had many chances in the parliament to talk over, but they did not take it and it was a very unwise decision for them to quit. And as you mentioned that the BNP leaders were jailed, you know, like three days before their so-called 10th December procession, they blocked the road in front of their party office. There was a total anarchy on the road. They actually attacked the police and that time for stabilizing the law and order situation, the police arrested some people and they arrested some political leaders. So that was for the sake of keeping the law and order situation. And some of them already got bail and they got released. So some case has been filed, so it will be prosecuted in accordance to the law of the country. So we don't think that there was any unlawful activities. And as you can see that their 10th December rally, the gathering was very peaceful. It was. OK. I want to bring in Ali at this point because I want to get an idea as to, first of all, whether you were surprised by the show of strength amongst the protesters despite efforts to keep them away, but also, as Tanvish Akhil says, how peaceful they ended up being. I'm not surprised because this 10th December gathering that you are referring to, it has been a build up to that. And there have been previously nine such kind of gatherings that BNP organized all around the country. And all of them tend to be very peaceful, despite the fact that there have been obstruction to joining those. There had been transport strike orchestrated by the government and it's supporting transport workers union and owners. But the point is here that it is not about BNP versus the Womili question. It is a question with respect to the governance issue. And what we have seen over the last years, the governance crisis has reached to an unprecedented proportion in the sense that you look at the economic crisis. What happened for decades, you know, or at least for a decade, that the government was claiming that they're having an enormous development and the growth is fantastic. Yet the economic crisis has, you know, befallen on the common people. So the peaceful parties that the BNP and people of Bangladesh, I would say, suggest that they would like to express their opinion. Restrictions have been imposed. Laws have been imposed. Digital Security Act is a case in point. And also we have seen extrajudicial killing and forced disappearance. So it is a question of the democracy, of having the right. Going back to 2018 election or for that matter, you can go up to 2014 election. There hasn't been any right to exercise their voting rights. What we have seen is that this is the situation. So generally speaking, the question is whether Bangladeshis would have the opportunity to express themselves, whether in the parliament or not is a secondary question to me at this point. Most importantly, it is the question of expressing, participating in assembly, right to assembly is an inalienable human rights that cannot be simply flaunted by the executive's decision. OK, Ramin, back to you and the quitting of parliament. If you are not expressing yourself in parliament, which Tambe Shaikhil said you were able to do, how are you going to how are you going to speak for the BNP? There are many ways. Parliament is one of the platforms that we were using. We have talk shows in our television channels. We can organise seminars and meetings and public meetings as well. So there are many platforms that can be used. I personally use Facebook, though I have a few cases against me under the Digital Security Act because of my writing in Facebook and my comments and sharing things against government. So, yes, we have we are under tremendous pressure, but we are trying to make the best use of the small space that we have. Tambe Shaikhil, one of the protesters key demands is a return, a reinstatement of the caretaker government. This was a non-political group that would be in power for around three months during the transfer of power during elections. Why did Shaikh Hasina get rid of that? It was a very popular system and it worked well in Bangladesh. Yeah, just answering that just two seconds. First of all, you know, right to assembly is there. And we always respect that. But for the right to assembly does not mean that you can block the road and hamper the general people's life. That's why government requested BNP. And also government party is having all the meetings in a field area, not on the roads. So that should be the norm. And when coming back to the caretaker government thing, the caretaker government was a popular system and which was actually enacted by Shaikh Hasina in 1996 when BNP had a very partial election of 15 November. Then Aomileg is the only party who peacefully actually handed over the power in the history of Bangladesh after 2001 election. But what we saw in 2006, BNP actually for some, I don't know, for some very weird reason, they increased the age limit of the chief of our court because he was supposed to become the caretaker government. And there the conflict started. And we all know what happened after that. In two years, the government had Bangladesh had a military rule due to that unrest. And caretaker government become very controversial. And for that reason, the high court, not Shaikh Hasina, the high court actually cancelled the caretaker government system, which was upheld by the apex court, supreme court. And when it came back and they said that then they send it back to the parliament and in the parliament, then upholding the judgment of the high court and the supreme court, the caretaker government were cancelled. And I just want to mention in 2014 election before the election, our honorable prime minister called late ex-prime minister Khaled Azeeha to propose that there is no caretaker government. So why don't we form a electoral election time government comprising of all the members in the parliament, all the parties? And unfortunately, Khaled Azeeha actually rejected that offer and she did not even hit to it. So that was it was cancelled by the court and then it was supported by the parliament. And we are for the first time in the history of Bangladesh has a new election commission, election commission forming law, which was actually proposed by the MP. We'll come back to that in just a moment. I just want to put this to Ramin because right now, Shaikh Hasina's government is in power. They are under fire for the abuses, alleged abuses of power that they are committing at the moment. But if we look back in history, the BMP has its own very checkered history, as Tanvir Shaikhil has just mentioned. And indeed, it could be said that the BMP Khaled Azeeha had its own role in this current political crisis by trying to bias the caretaker government in 2006. What's the response of the BMP to that? My response is very clear. There is a clear difference between our Milik regime and BMP ruling time because BMP was elected by the people. And since it was elected, it was accountable to the people. Since our Milik is not elected from 2014, it is not accountable to its people. And it is using forces like killing, extrajudicial killing, and force disappearance and stuff like that to oppress the opposition and to oppress the voice of people who criticize government and stuff like that. So you just cannot compare the time of BMP with the time of our Milik because our Milik is not elected by the people, first of all. Secondly, what I want to say is the Constitution is not a holy book. It's not Quran or Bible that you can never change. It has already been changed 16 times and it can be changed for a 17th time as well. So it cannot be a reason that the caretaker government is not in the Constitution, so it can never be implemented. You know, in 90s, there was no caretaker government in the Constitution, but there was doctrine of necessity and after the fall of Ershad regime, some sort of caretaker government was formed at that time. And we have seen the election of 91, 96, 2001, and 2006 elections, the only four elections that were accepted by more or less potipatis. So it shows that our political culture is such that we cannot have a fair free election under a partisan government. OK, OK. And I mean, it's very clear from 1973, if you want to go back to that time. Let's stick with going forward. Ali Riaz, do you agree that Bangladesh does need a caretaker government in this very polarized environment? Absolutely, absolutely. However you call it, whether you call it caretaker government, election government, what is necessary is a government which would act neutrally. There would not be a partisan bias. And if you look at the 11 elections, only four of the elections in Bangladesh, which turned out to be free and fair and acceptable, relatively acceptable to everybody, are those which were being conducted under a neutral caretaker government. The point is, number one is the mutual distrust between the two political parties, not only two political parties. As a matter of fact, it is not only demand of the BNP. If you look at the other opposition parties, they are demanding the same. They have demanded the same thing in 2014 and as a matter of fact in 2018 because of the one is the mutual distrust. Second thing is that what we have seen is the entire administration, including law enforcement agencies, have been pretty much made very much partisan. And other than having an administration that is beyond our, you know, this political reach, meaning that there is no political bias or political leaning, an election that would not be acceptable. And as a matter of fact, we have seen the lack of participation as well. I mean, if you look back into 2014 election, there hasn't been more than 23, 24% participation. And then what happened in 2018, it is reported in international media that the ballot stuffing took place with the support of the administration the night before. All these things actually indicate that there has to be a system where no political party. I'm not talking about only two political parties. I'm saying no political parties have this undue advantage and there is a level playing field. What we have seen the use of the law enforcement agencies against opposition political parties. And it is not only again what we have seen over the last 40 years, if not more, that the opposition political parties have no space. The media had very little, you know, of independence to speak out. Tanvir, Tanvir Shaikhil, we've had 15 Western embassies release a joint statement. The UN also have been calling for free and fair elections. If you had a caretaker government in place, as the protesters are demanding, would it not legitimize the elections? No, we don't think so. First of all, that, you know, as it was just being said that maybe there is distrust between political parties. But if we say that who will become the member of the caretaker government, you know, that they are from Bangladesh, right? So they are definitely having political bias to any AOM League or BNP or any other way. And we have seen that, you know, what happens with the caretaker government from 2006 to 2008. We had two years of military rules. So we strongly believe that whatever government, whatever is the name, it should have, you know, people representative there, maybe from AOM League, BNP and all other parties together. And that can be called election time government as it was proposed by honorable Prime Minister Sheikh Qassim in 2014. But we don't think because the caretaker government will be the solution because we never know that the caretaker government will bring another, you know, military government or military backed civilian government in Bangladesh. So I think that will not be a solution. And when it was talking about 2014 election, 2014 election, BNP did not participate. You have the democratic right not to participate or not to participate. Just one second. But you don't have right to burn down polling agents. You don't write, burn down living people to file the election. So I think I think, you know, our this is the first time we have a law of the election commission and election commission is very strong. We are hoping that the election commission will have all the power. OK, so you may be hoping that but the people on the streets are not hoping for that. So, Rameen, just finally, it does not sound as if the Sheikh Qassim government has heard the demands of the protesters or will act on them. So what will the BNP do next? We are now trying to strengthen our organization power. We are trying to make allies with other political parties. And at the same time, you can see that people are with us. They are expressing their support. They are coming to our meetings. They are you can see. I mean, if you see the media, you see that they are with us. So hopefully we will overcome this situation. OK, well, you say people. It will be Bangladesh remains a very polarized society. People supporting the BNP, people supporting the Awami League. It does not seem as if the middle shall be met there. We do have to leave the discussion for the moment. Thanks very much to our guests, Rameen Farhana, Tavit Hanver, Shaquille Joy and Ali Riaz. And thank you two for watching.

This is Counting the Cost on Al Jazeera, your look at the world of business and economics. This week, the US is facing a fiscal standoff that could put the nation at risk of defaulting on its debt for the first time ever. So, what's behind America's debt ceiling crisis? And should the rest of the world be worried? Also this week, it's seen as Britain's national treasure, but the country's health service system is falling apart. So, how did the NHS reach this point? And is there a way out of the crisis? Plus, the travel and tourism industry is picking up speed this year. The travellers' tastes are changing and they're increasingly going green. So, the US debt is now six times what it was at the start of this century. Despite its growing liabilities, the country has never defaulted on its payments. Now, the US has crashed through its $31.4 trillion borrowing limit. And that means the government could run out of cash to pay its bills in less than five months and puts Congress on the clock to raise or suspend the debt ceiling. But getting lawmakers to agree on that is expected to be a tough political battle on Capitol Hill. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives refuses to raise the debt limit unless President Joe Biden agrees to steep spending cuts. Democrats want it to be raised without any conditions. The Treasury Department has started taking so-called extraordinary measures, including suspending investments for retirees, to avoid missing financial obligations to bondholders. But that would give Congress and Biden until early June to resolve the issue. Well, the United States is among a few countries to set a legal limit on borrowing. So, what exactly is the debt ceiling? It's the maximum amount the government can borrow to pay bills already approved by lawmakers. It doesn't include new spending commitments. The measure was first introduced back in 1917 to make it easier for the government to finance its participation in the First World War. It has been periodically raised because the US runs large annual deficits and the revenue it collects isn't sufficient. The nation's debt is currently at more than 120 percent of GDP, but that's still lower than more than a dozen countries, including Japan, Greece and Italy. In recent years, with the US becoming more partisan, lawmakers have used the debt ceiling vote as leverage against other issues. Indeed, a standoff over the debt ceiling in 2011 led Standard & Poor's to cut the US's credit rating for the first time ever. Well, to discuss all of that, I'm joined now from London by Richard Siegel, Richard's research analyst at Ambrosia Capital. Welcome to the program, sir. So first up, I think it's worth repeating, isn't it? The US debt six times what it was at the start of the century. How come? Well, there are a number of different reasons. There's natural growth in debt anyway, with the economy growing and spending growing and with inflation and the like. But I think the problems really go to the early part of the 2000s when fiscal discipline was lost after the end of the dot com crisis. And then things really got bad in the last Republican administration when there were some major tax cuts and things got even worse at the beginning of the last administration, both because of pandemic related spending and also because of tax cuts. The difference between the Republican tax cuts and the Democratic tax cuts is that the first were corporate oriented and the second were individual oriented. All right. So we so we are where we are now. And if the debt limit is not raised, basically the federal government just runs out of cash, right? Yes, that's correct. There is a very arcane calculation which determines the debt limit. You really do have to be a specialist in order to understand it. But at a certain point, the US government can no longer borrow and therefore technically it would go into default because the consequences would be so devastating. It's pretty likely that an agreement would be reached, even if it's very painful and even if it's at the very last minute. Why does it have to be painful? Why does it have to be the last minute? Why not just raise the debt ceiling? It's politics. It has happened many times over the past 15, 20 years. In fact, the debt limit law itself dates to 1917. It doesn't really make any economic sense. Maybe it makes some economic sense, but it's it's just something that there's never been enough political will to do away with. The US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has introduced so-called extraordinary measures, I think, to buy time. How costly are these to ordinary Americans and what kind of things are we talking about? They're called extraordinary, but in fact, they're really just accounting techniques. The US government issues a lot of debt to Social Security funds and the like, which are effectively non marketable in their off balance sheet. It can effectively borrow from them for six to eight months. It's a very serious situation, but I wouldn't say that any kind of default would be imminent. We have plenty of time in order to solve this. So we brace ourselves to enter the world of partisan wrangling. What do the Republicans want and and how will compromise be reached? It will have to be reached eventually. The difficulty right now is that this is not just a battle between the Republicans and the Democrats, but it's also a battle within the Democrats, excuse me, within the Republican Party, largely because of the long battle in order for Kevin McCarthy to be nominated as House Speaker. He was required to give some concessions to some of the independent mining congressmen, and they are the ones that are holding out against the Republican Party. So it's not just the typical Republican versus Democratic struggle. But what is it on the whole that the Republicans want? Well, what they want is some concessions in terms of lower spending, which would, as one would expect, lower spending on districts that would be of benefit to the Democratic voters or perhaps in some of the swing states, as we call them. What the independent minded Republicans would like is lower spending as a whole, which wouldn't be realistic. It wouldn't be a good idea. Perhaps the pace of spending increase should be lower, but you wouldn't want to spend too much less when the economy is already very weak. You say there's no appetite for abolishing the debt limit, but it sounds like that's exactly what should be done, given the the wrangling that seems to happen all the time over this. Why is there no political appetite? It's difficult to tell. It's just one of these things that always falls by the wayside. Other priorities tend to become more important. And because it's been its place for such a long time, more than a century, it just builds its own inertia. It has actually been beneficial sometimes in the past, for example, the mid 1990s when it encouraged fiscal discipline in a bipartisan manner. But that didn't last very long. A crisis happens or something else becomes their priority and they lose that discipline. Tell us more about the U.S.'s debt to GDP ratio. Just just how does America's debt compare, say, to other countries? It is very high. It's approaching 140 percent of GDP. It will decline naturally as some pandemic related spending declines and because of what we call the inflation tax. But historically, it had been on the order of 70 to 80 percent. The European limit is 60 percent. Most countries are above that. But Germany is about 70 percent. Germany was on the wrong path, but it managed to reduce its debt load even with low growth and low inflation. So it can be done with a political will. It's much higher in countries such as Italy and Japan. However, the distinction there is that there's less private debt and savings rates in both of those countries are very high and also they have trade surpluses so they can sustain much higher debt levels. But in the U.S., it's very high. So at some point something has to be done. Is a default on debt inevitable if there is no agreement? If there is, it would be inevitable. However, I think the silver lining is that it would be so devastating that within a day or two there wouldn't there would be an emergency agreement even if it's on a bipartisan manner in order to resolve it, just because not the that there would be a great impact on the U.S. government, but there would be a great impact on the U.S. economy and the rest of the world. Richard Siegel, appreciate that. Thank you. For nearly three quarters of a century, the British government has provided mostly free health care for all Britons and the National Health Service has long been the country's most revered institution, in fact, ranking first in a 2016 survey. But the NHS is now at breaking point. Hospitals are running beyond their capacity. Ambulance waits are at record highs and stress staff are striking over pay and working conditions. Nadine Bhabha looks at the debates on the future of the system. With strikes spreading and talk of a system on its knees is Britain's reverence for its National Health Service blocking much needed reform? Sajid Javid certainly thinks so. The Conservative former health secretary and finance minister wrote recently the 75-year-old model of the NHS is unsustainable. Javid suggested people could pay for consulting a family doctor and praised Ireland's system where patients must pay around $81 to access the equivalent of the UK's accident and emergency departments, A&E, unless referred by their doctor. Now that's the sort of idea most British politicians run away from because it means scrapping the doctrine that health care should be free at the point of need. The prime minister has distanced himself from the comments that Rishi Sunak did before taking office. Talk about issuing fines to NHS patients who miss appointments. He then backtracked. The opposition Labour parties also stepped into the debate. Shadow Health Secretary Wes Streating has suggested the growing waiting lists could be tackled by the NHS sending more patients to private hospitals. Louise Irvine, a retired family doctor and anti-privatisation campaigner, thinks that's a bad idea. There isn't an infinite pool of doctors and nurses and a lot of doctors and nurses go to the private sector because they get paid more. And furthermore, when something goes wrong in the private sector, the patient is then, you know, red-lighted straight into an NHS A&E. Now, what we need is we need to build up our NHS again. Louise says she did see real improvements in patient experience in the 2000s under Labour when annual increases in NHS funding were higher than they are now. Since it was created, spending on the NHS has increased by an average 3.7 per cent per year in real terms. But from 2010 to 2018, when the Conservatives governed in coalition and then on their own, annual NHS funding growth slowed to 1.4 per cent. It's rising more quickly now, but an aging population and increasing demand for expensive treatments means nobody's noticing. If we look at the NHS compared to other OECD countries, we have fewer doctors and nurses per head of population, we have fewer hospital beds per head of population, we have lower levels of investment in things like diagnostic equipment. And all those things are not about the way in which the NHS is organised and funded. That's about the fundamental decisions we made about the level that we want to spend on health in this country. So the challenge to the politicians is this, dealing with the crises hitting the health service right now, planning for the long term and avoiding a two tier system. Nadine Barber for Counting the Cost in London. Well let's take this on. Joining me now also from London is Sam Thames, who's an economist at the New Economics Foundation Think Tank. Sam Thames, welcome to the programme. So the NHS is in crisis, even the former health secretary, Sajid Javid, says the system is unsustainable. Do you agree with that? Well no, I think the funding for the NHS is unsustainable. The model of free at the point of use funded by general taxation, that works. But over the last 13 years under the austerity policy that we've had, actually we haven't been investing enough in the NHS compared to the need that the country has. The need for the NHS has grown, but compared to our international peers, our funding into the NHS has fallen far below the average. Troubles, if you put more money into the NHS, then don't other services suffer? No, that's not necessarily true at all actually, because if you have a healthy workforce, more people can go into work and therefore they aren't necessarily in as much need of social security and they're able to pay more tax. So at the moment we've got about half a million people that are economically inactive, so kind of not looking for work, half a million more compared to before the pandemic. And we've also got about half a million people on NHS waiting lists, half a million more than before the pandemic. Now that's not a one for one, but actually there will be a large amount of overlap and by having a healthy population you can have a healthier economy. So why have we reached this point? Why is the NHS in such a state? Well there are a few different reasons. The funding that I just mentioned is a big issue, because the needs of our country have grown, we have an aging population and actually the funding into the NHS hasn't kept up. There's also a major issue of staffing, we've got something like 160,000 vacancies in the NHS, it's about one in ten positions. Part of that is because of pay for NHS staff. There's a reason why nurses are out on strike at the moment, an experienced nurse is actually worse off on their pay than they were about 10 to 15 years ago, and you have nurses going to food banks. That's not a system that is working at all and a huge amount of that comes down to the lack of pay and public sector pay freezes that we've had over the last 15 years. There's also a major issue to do with social care, which is then having an impact on the NHS as well. Right, let's look at funding. There are various ideas floating about out there, including Javid himself who proposed making NHS patients pay their doctors for doctor's appointments and even A&E emergency departments using a kind of means-tested system. I think I'm right in saying that that works to a degree, certainly in Sweden and Ireland. Realistically, that's not going to work in the UK. First of all, let's not forget that we do pay for the NHS, we pay for it through national income tax and other forms of taxation, so we are paying for the service that we get, but when you arrive at your GP, at your A&E, it's free at the point of use. If you put a charge on that, well, it's going to deter people from going to these services. That means that when you've got someone that starts to get a bit ill, they're not going to go to the GP. Instead, they're going to wait several weeks longer, possibly months longer, until they're seriously ill and then they require far more time from the NHS than they would have if the NHS was able to be there right at the start of their illness. There's something here, you mentioned the model a moment ago of the NHS, there's definitely more that the NHS can do around preventative care, about care in the community, but if you impose a charge for people going and trying to ensure that their health stays as good as it can be, we're never going to get close to that form of preventative care. All right, Sam, so then how do you reform the funding process? Well, we have to have a frank discussion here in the UK. Right now, we have American style taxes or we're trying to get towards that, but with European style welfare state. So actually, we need to have an honest discussion of how we're paying for the NHS through taxation, who's paying for it. It's well known that non-doms, for example, aren't paying their fair share of tax. Landlords as well aren't paying their fair share of national insurance or capital gains. There are lots of holes in the tax system, which are quite easy wins for a government of any colour to come in and fix. And immediately you could put that money back into the NHS. What about this idea finally of relying on the private sector and hospitals to help rescue the NHS put forward by the Labour Party? So maybe as a very short term plan, this could work, but anything longer than short term doesn't quite make sense. We have a staffing issue both in the NHS and in social care, where we've also got about 130,000 vacancies. If we can rely too much on that private model, staffing within the NHS in particular is going to get even worse. And that means a greater reliance on private health care. All right. Well, it's a battle ahead. Sam Thames, appreciate that. Thanks very much. Thank you. After two years of pandemic disruptions, the travel industry is roaring back this year. Great news for countries that rely on tourism for revenue, but bad news over concerns of rising CO2 emissions on international flights. However, a new report shows there's a shift in travellers' mindsets and many are now more encouraged to decrease their carbon footprint. More than 60 per cent of travellers surveyed in the report have chosen sustainable options in the last couple of years and three quarters of travellers plan to do so in the future. It also found the majority of high end travellers are willing to pay more money to make their trips more environmentally friendly. The survey was part of a report conducted by the World Travel and Tourism Sector, Trip.com and the global consultancy firm Deloitte. So let's dig in more into this report with Julia Simpson, the President and Executive Officer at the World Travel and Tourism Council. Joining us from London, Julia, welcome. So 69 per cent of travellers actively seeking more sustainable travel options. What's driving this rise in demand for sustainable travel? Yes, it's really interesting and thank you, Nick, for inviting me on from a very chilly London I have to say. I think after the pandemic, we saw a very big pent up demand for travel and tourism and people were looking to get back to nature, looking to get to the great outdoors and I think it was inevitable really after being all cooped up. But I think that also made people have a greater appreciation of nature and the value and the preciousness of travel. So and apart from that, sustainability has been going up everybody's, you know, personal lists of what they need to achieve this year. You know, how can I be more sustainable in every aspect of my life? But certainly we published a trend report and the very top item was people saying that they want to travel more responsibly. So the demand is there, is the supply, is the travel and tourism industry adapting to this? Are we seeing a rise in eco-friendly hotels and travel destinations? Absolutely. You know, you're seeing it all over the world. I was talking to a new member of the World Travel and Tourism Council, Beth Weston, and they said, you know, that when they make hotels, they'll often have solar panels associated at the back of the hotel and that will be powering the hotel. You're seeing hotels around the world wanting to source their food more locally from local suppliers, you know, and that helps build a strong local economy and give seasonal food rather than maybe a great big food fest where there's a lot of food waste. People in hotels now are avoiding the use of plastics, water in countries where water is very, very scarce. There are some very incredible examples of how people are recycling and reusing water in places like Africa. So, yes, very, very much. It's a top of the agenda for hoteliers globally as well. Isn't sustainable travel a lot more expensive? And, you know, times are hard. Yes, it's really interesting because the trends reports that we looked at acknowledge the fact that people are paying, you know, higher inflation. They've got, you know, their living costs are going up. And yet, really interestingly, when it looks at, you know, spend that you wouldn't necessarily have to make, people are saying that they want to keep travel top of their list. And again, I think that is very much a reaction after being sort of locked up for two to three years. You know, China's just reopened and we're seeing the bookings are going off the scale. So, yes, in a way, I'm not at all surprised that people are prioritising travel. And you're talking about does it affect costs? Interestingly, for hoteliers, for example, to become more efficient in terms of energy use, yes, it does sometimes cost an initial outlay, an initial investment. But once a hotel is set up, it will actually make the hotel cheaper to run. There is one catch here, isn't there? You have to fly to get to many of these destinations and flying currently is not sustainable travel. Well, you know, it was so interesting because I was looking at the other day that when we use the internet now, the use of the internet is now outstripping in terms of the carbon that it produces, because every time we do a search, it fires up great big data centres around the world. And that search now actually means that the carbon produced from that is more than it is in air travel. But having said all that, that's really just to put it into context. It's not about shaming one sector against another sector. We're all in this together and every human activity from the moment we wake up or indeed, you know, even if we're lying asleep in bed with the heating on, every human activity has an impact. And flying, and I come from an aviation background, we have been working since the 1970s on trying to find cleaner ways to fly. As you know, jet fuel is a very particular elite type of fuel. Why it's so important is it's so pure, is that it doesn't freeze at 30,000 feet. So we've been trying desperately to find alternatives to this. And now the really great news is there is an alternative. It's called sustainable aviation fuel and the technology exists. And what we need now is the big oil producers, when they're pumping out so much power to reserve a part of their business to produce sustainable aviation fuel, because the money's there, the technology is there, the government can do it. Because if you think about governments, they put a lot of regulation in to help people move from petrol and diesel cars to electric cars. So they've done it for ground transportation. So all that sort of regulation is readily available to be able to use for aviation as well. Yeah, it's a question of scaling it up, isn't it? That's the issue, scaling it up to the degree that it's needed. I just want to move on. Finally, I just want to ask you, given this issue about flying, are more sustainable type holidays being offered that you could take without having to board an aircraft? Yes, you know, domestic travel around the world really benefited. We all know that, you know, people in the Middle East, they stayed locally, they discovered parts of the Middle East they'd never been before. In the UK, people were, you know, traveling around to cities and towns and going to the great outdoors that they had never possibly seen before. So I think that desire for domestic travel and understanding your own culture will continue. And people are using the train. But actually, if you look at the numbers that we're looking at, people are booking now well in advance, and they're booking long haul, and they're booking to go on holidays. Actually, the advent of cities and beach holidays are coming back after wanting to be in the great outdoors and not having to be too close to another human being. Now people actually want to get back to see the culture in the cities and relax on the coast. All fascinating stuff. Appreciate that, Julia Simpson. Thank you. Thank you.

But there was to be no commitment from Germany that it would send its Leopard tanks to Ukraine. We don't fear anything. We have just responsibility for our population in Germany and in Europe. And we have to balance all the pros and cons before we decide things like that, just like that. This is nothing else. And I'm very sure that there will be a decision in the short term, but I don't know why and I don't know how the decision will look. This lack of a concrete timeline is, despite Germany's NATO allies and Ukraine itself, pressuring hard for the tanks to be sent. I encourage you to make such decisions that can deprive Russian evil of any power. You can start this policy today. It is in your power to make a Rammstein of tanks, not to bargain about different numbers of tanks, but to open a principled supply that will stop Russian evil. Some fear that sending Leopard tanks could mean an escalation of the war and drag NATO into a direct confrontation with Russia. The tanks have been sold to dozens of countries around the world. Those who want to export them to Ukraine need permission from Germany first. After weeks of international pressure, Germany has made it clear that it will take a decision on whether or not to send Leopard tanks to Ukraine in its own time. President Zelensky's plea that time is not a luxury his country has had little effect, because Germany says it's a decision that needs to be carefully weighed. Despite the setback, there have been promises of new military hardware for Ukraine. US Defense Secretary Austin urging countries not to waste too much time. This is a decisive decade for the world. And this is a decisive moment for Ukraine's struggle to defend itself. So this contact group will not slow down. We're going to continue to dig deep. And based upon the progress that we've made today, I'm confident that Ukraine's partners from around the globe are determined to meet this moment. In Berlin, a group of protesters also tried to put pressure on the government to take a decision on sending Leopard tanks sooner rather than later.

That brings the number fired by big tech companies to more than 200,000 in just over a year. Why are so many jobs being lost in the sector worldwide and is big tech in big trouble? This is Inside Story. Hello, welcome to the programme. I'm Adrian Finnegan. 12,000 Google employees opened an email on Friday telling them that their jobs are gone. The tech giant is the latest to announce big layoffs of staff. It follows others like Meta, the owner of Facebook and WhatsApp, as well as Twitter and Microsoft. Different reasons have been given for such major job cuts. Some blame over recruitment during the height of the pandemic. Others, wrong strategies for the future. Then, of course, there's the worsening economic climate. Here's a closer look at what's been happening in the industry. More than 200,000 people, as we said, have been fired in the sector in the past 12 months. Google, the latest to announce cuts, shedding 12,000 jobs. That's around 6% of its workforce. Meta, the owner of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, is cutting 11,000 jobs, or 13% of its workforce. And Microsoft is laying off 10,000 employees, many in its video game division. So let's bring in our guests for today's discussion. From Dublin, we're joined by Elaine Burke, science and technology journalist and also host of the For Tech's Sake podcast. From New York, Jim Anderson, who is the chief executive officer of Beacon Software and social media sector lead at Glasswing Ventures. And again, from Dublin, Adrienne Weckler, technology editor at the Irish Independent newspaper. Good to have all of you on Inside Story. Welcome to the programme. Elaine, let's start with you. Do these job cuts indicate that big tech is in big trouble? But if so, why? I certainly think that people will definitely feel that way, that this is a signal that all of tech is in trouble. But at the end of the day, these companies are still hiring in some areas. I mean, Amazon also announced about 18,000 jobs lost. And this weekend has announced that it's creating 1,000 jobs in Virginia with the launch of a new data center. So the areas that have growth for them will still see job creation. But it does seem that certain areas they're going to pull back on. In the case of Google, you're looking at a lot of their kind of other bets, their research and development side of things, the things that maybe won't turn a profit until they've had it on. Long, long years of development. So they may pull back on a lot of that stuff. And they may also kind of cut back on the support services that they offer in terms of their ad tech because they have agencies that can support that instead. And there's definitely been talk of that happening already and even ahead of the job cuts announcements. You talk about them perhaps cutting back on in areas that won't turn a profit for some years to come. But isn't that short sighted of them? I suppose it's not short sighted if what their goal is, is the current market and making sure that improvements are coming here. The timing of both Microsoft and Google's announcements comes just as they're about to report their full year figures for 2022. That's expected in early February. And it seems that they might be anticipating what would be stock market ripples coming from those earnings announcements. And what we see when these jobs cuts announcements are made is that the stock market price tends to go up and Google itself saw a five percent rise in its share price on the foot of this announcement. So essentially, it seems to be they are thinking in the short term of the stock market price and hedging maybe for an issue that's coming with the earnings call in February. And they're trying to anticipate those impacts. Jim Addison in New York, we listed some of the reasons why tech companies are cutting back on their workforce, one of them being the pandemic boom not carrying through after the pandemic. Why couldn't the visionaries in the tech industry have have foreseen that? Why didn't the boom continue as life returned to normal for many of us? Well, I dreamt I mean, it's interesting. You know, the phrase that comes to mind to me is what goes up, what must go down. Right. And I know the pandemic was remarkable and unprecedented in modern times. And I'm not sure anybody knew exactly what was going to happen afterwards. So in many ways, it feels like what's been changed here is is this era of expectations of inevitability that everything is going to continue to go up and to the right for these tech companies. That's clearly not true. They're public companies. They have stock prices. And when the stock prices go down, they face the same kind of pressures that the automakers and the drug manufacturers and everybody else faces. And this is sadly a well-worn playbook. When your stock's under pressure, you you cut costs. And now we're seeing it from the tech. So it's capitalism at work here. It really is. And it's really unfortunate. I mean, I don't think we should ever be glib about 10,000 or 100,000 people. These are real people losing their jobs. They have paychecks. They have families. They have mortgages. So there is a very significant human cost. The flip side of that, though, is, you know, we're so pleased when we see great job growth, when we see companies hiring. One of the expectations, at least in the United States, is different, obviously in different countries, is if I'm going to hire people and you're going to be excited when I do that, I need to actually be able to reduce and let people go when times aren't so good. So that's that's the downside. And none of us like to see that. But that's the reality. In order for people to be willing to hire when times are good, they also have to be able to let people go when times are not so good. Adrian, in Dublin, each company is cutting back somewhere between between five and 10 percent of its workforce. Is is that just coincidence? I wonder what percentage of tech sector workers are actually contractors or freelance. Are these cuts going to affect them, too? People who are not on the full time payroll, they're not full time employees. It could well do. So if you take one company that has an out cuts, for example, Google, here in Dublin, they employ 10,000 people, half of which are full time staff, half of which are contractors. Now, the full time staff, the employees could go from, say, five thousand to maybe four four thousand seven hundred. We don't know what the figure will be for the contractors or we won't know for a while. They would be big outsourcing firms like Accenture. So there is potentially a second tier effect on the contractors as well. Don't forget, though, that employment in these tech companies went up by about a third in the pandemic. So Amazon, for example, was in Seattle, was hiring five thousand people every year in addition so that the cuts we're seeing now are not good. And it may be a canary in the coal mine in terms of a wider recession, but they're bringing the tech industry back to around the levels they were a year ago. And most of them that I talk to, because they're all here in Dublin, for example, most of them that I talk to are still talking about hiring, particularly in the second half of the year. OK, so it's not necessarily going to have a detrimental impact upon the economy there in Dublin, unless, as you say, it's a canary in a coal mine and there's worse to come, not just in the tech sector. Their narratives clashing here because there was a feeling that there was overheating going on in most Western cities in the world. For example, there's a housing crisis. A good chunk of that was caused by tech tech companies that had expanded so, so quickly. Now, we mustn't overlook the fact, and Jim might have mentioned it, and you mentioned it, of a potential recession, particularly in the US, which many of the tech companies, which are shedding jobs. That's really the market they're guided by. Also, don't underestimate regulatory effects in markets like Europe. Here we've seen pieces of legislation like the Digital Services Act, companies like Meta and Google, which are deeply reliant on advertising and personalised advertising. They're taking potentially a big hit there as well. So there are many factors at play. Elaine, you touched on something a moment ago when you said that the downturn doesn't appear to be affecting all companies equally. Apple, as you say, yet to announce job losses. That doesn't mean to say that there won't be any, but it has yet to announce any. There are other companies too. Does that perhaps signal that other companies were more cautious in the first place when it came to hiring during the recession? During the pandemic, they didn't gamble on the pandemic boom. Yeah, but even those who said that they were being cautious still seem to have fallen into this trap. I mean, technically speaking, Google was externally reporting that it was on a hiring freeze for much of 2022, but then it transpires that they hired about 30,000 people, mostly at the top of that year. So maybe the hiring freeze didn't really implement it until later. But it does seem to be that even those who were attempting to be cautious and maybe outwardly saying that they were being cautious still fell into a trap that they just kind of believed the boom would continue forever and ever and hoped that it would. Shopify is another example. CEO Tobias Lutke, they had said in an earnings report that showed massive growth during the pandemic that they knew that this kind of e-commerce growth was not sustainable. It was pandemic led and it was because of the crisis situation and people being at home and e-commerce having a boom because of that. And still they then a few months later announced job cuts because they had over anticipated how much that growth would sustain. So even those who were aware of it and reported themselves being aware of it still fell into that trap. We've had companies here in Ireland that are at unicorn growth stage, growing and scaling companies and just recently hitting that billion dollar valuation like Wayfair, who are now having to pull back on very recent hiring plans. So there does seem to be that even though they're very much aware that they shouldn't fall into this trap of over hiring for what is a crisis economy, it still seems to be something that they fall it fall into. Jim, I want to come back to what you were saying earlier on as well about about this being capitalism at work. These companies are still, for the most part, making money. In some cases, they're making a lot of money. OK, sure, I get it. What you were saying. You can't have people on the payroll who are surplus to requirements. But who's driving the cutbacks? Is this is this the companies themselves, the accountants say, oh, well, right, we're a bit heavy here. We need to let people go. Or is this shareholders? This is people who are looking to profit out of the sex, the success of these tech companies. Ultimately, it is the shareholders. I think you just nailed it. And of course, the accountants keep track of what we report to the shareholders. And so if you're an executive at one of these companies, it's interesting. There is a contagion that goes on for both good and bad. You know, it's easy to talk about. We should be disciplined. We should be cautious. We shouldn't over hire. We shouldn't overeat, to use the phrase that somebody used earlier. And that's all well said and done. And that sounds good. But then when you're in a bull market and everything is going crazy, you know, your own employees are wondering, why are we not capitalizing on this opportunity? Why are we not growing? Why are we not hiring? And so everybody gets caught up in this idea that we've got to keep up. And then, of course, when inevitably the music stops and things slow down, you've got real shareholders, including activist shareholders, which largely had ignored tech companies. The activist shareholders were were not really in and around big tech. But they take a stake in your company. They start nominating new members to your board. They start putting pressure on you. Now you look like a lot of other public companies is OK, our stock price, as long as it was going up, I could get whatever air cover I needed to do that. Once it starts going down, I've got to respond to the market. So it is very much the shareholders in the stock market ultimately driving this. All right. So in terms of innovation and the impact that these tech giants have had and continue to have on all our lives, the question, Jim, is should activist shareholders be able to wield so much power? To what extent are they holding back innovation in these companies? Yeah, that's a great question about stock markets and the role of publicly traded companies and who takes what positions. I think in general, if you wanted to argue that point purely around technology, and I'll take that element of your question. I mean, these are the most innovative technology companies in the world and as painful as it is, especially if you're one of the, say, 10,000 people who've lost your job. We're talking about five percent, 10 percent, 13 percent, I think was the number you mentioned for for Facebook and Metta. So these are not, for the most part, massive cuts. Now, Twitter is a special exception, you know, a company that had other problems and Elon Musk. So let's set that aside. But but these are still amazing engines of innovation. And it would be wildly extreme to say, OK, all of a sudden, Google and Microsoft and Amazon and Facebook are no longer going to be innovative because they cut five or 10 or 13 percent of their employees. I think that's generally unlikely, unsustainable. And you from the outside looking in, you're not going to see any appreciable difference in the output of those companies in the near term. And, you know, ultimately, there certainly will be an impact, but it won't be visible to you and I, by and large. Yeah. Elaine was saying earlier on, perhaps, you know, it may be a little a little short sighted. Let's put that question into both Adrian and Elaine in terms of of of the future, Adrian, and driving the innovation that we've all lived over the last 20 years and will, we're promised, continue to change our lives for the better. Not always, but but mostly a job losses on this scale going to going to hold things back. And what's your view on this on this shareholder activist point that we were discussing? Well, two, two points on that. First of all, you probably remember the big dot com crash in 1999. And there were a few companies that were on the up at that time and who crashed along with the crash. One of them was a small company called Amazon. And everybody said that Amazon was finished and, you know, it was too ambitious. We know 20 years later, Amazon is arguably the world's dominant retail company because it exactly, as you say, it twigged the change in our behavior and how the economy works. And you may see that in effect now. I mean, Jim makes an excellent point. It's only 10 percent in most cases of staff that are being let go. Many startup companies that I talk to say that downturns like this, where there's a certain number of people being let go from the big companies are actually very good for them because they find it very difficult to hire people in normal boom times. Now they might be able to afford to hire a director of engineering and other very valuable staff. So it's very possible that actually you might see this bloodletting, if you want to call it that, you might see new blood and new companies and new ideas and new startups. That is something I want to home in on in a few moments, Adrian. First, Elaine, I want to ask you a specific question about about Metta here and Mark Zuckerberg in particular. Were they wrong to bet so heavily on on what medicals the metaverse and the rest of us might call virtual reality? What do the job losses at Metta say about about his leadership? They definitely call it into question, but Mark Zuckerberg is particularly powerful at Metta in that he's also the largest shareholder and does hold a lot of sway because of that position. But I think the question is about like we were talking about how innovative these companies truly are. I mean, they are labeled as innovative companies and they're very wealthy and powerful. So we see them that way. But a lot of the innovations these days are bought in. And even in the case of the metaverse, that's from Oculus, which was bought by Facebook a number of years ago. And it does seem to have been a bit of a passion project of Zuckerberg's for some time. And now he has this vision that we will all be operating the metaverse despite reports from people who do have to live and work in this for the sake of their jobs are not really enjoying it. There's not really a user demand side for this. So you see this kind of problem in Metta where it's a bit of a like lone tech visionary. And if you bet everything on that lone tech visionary having the right vision, well, then you're going to encounter the problems that they're facing now where they're investing a lot of money into a last making division. That doesn't seem to have the solid future that the CEO presumes it to have. In the case of Google, you have essentially an advertising business for the large part of its existence. They are now trying to compete with cloud services where Amazon Web Services absolutely takes the top spot there. And then Microsoft would be a distant second. So Google is even the third player among the big tech giants in that space. But that is a space where they do seem to see there's opportunity. They are making lots of cuts there, but not in customer facing roles, not an engineering type roles. And Google does need to find a new revenue stream because the ad tech advertising business definitely isn't going to sustain the size of the company that it is. And that seems to be where it's focusing. But then it's talking about pivoting to A.I. essentially. And that's where we get what where I question the innovativeness of these companies because they are just following trends. There's a great singularity. We now have Twitter copying and take talks interface with for you and following and you see that happen all the time across these companies. They copy and they acquire and new ideas actually aren't often brought to the fore. I think Apple is actually quite good at bringing new ideas out there, but they're very smart about it. They understand market research and all that kind of stuff. And then in terms of meta, you have Mark Zuckerberg trying to bring a new idea to the floor that he doesn't seem to understand doesn't resonate with the everyday person. Jim, do you want to join us? Say anything about Mark Zuckerberg Zuckerberg here and his leadership. To what extent do you think he's holding meta back? Well, it's interesting. His his vision for virtual reality and the metaverse, you know, I think many of us myself included question that it seems very dubious. But it was interesting. Just a few minutes ago we were talking about companies being short sighted. Right. So I mean, it's a little bit like you're going to be criticized no matter what you do. And in fairness to Mark Zuckerberg, you know, the four of us can all have our opinions. None of us has founded a company that became worth five hundred billion dollars or more. So he probably deserves the benefit of the doubt. But that being said, I'm just like most people, intensely skeptical that we that's a world we want to live in. And I think history may prove that that was really a poor judgment or it's entirely possible that he is playing the long game. Like we talked about, he's trying to be strategic and innovative for the future. And maybe the metaverse will play out in ways that we don't understand and can't predict. And I guess that's the role of a visionary. And, you know, it is true that he controls the company. He's a super he has super voting rights as a shareholder. So effectively he can ignore the outside noise, probably in a way that most other companies, including Google and even Amazon, cannot. So he can certainly insulate himself from from the criticism if that's what he choose to do. Adrian, I want to pick up on what you were saying there. And also what Jim was saying about visionaries there. Where are the future visionaries? To what extent will Nimble, smaller companies who can innovate faster than the behemoths, take a share of the businesses? We all know today about Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Metta, Netflix and so on. In 10 years time, even five years time, will other new companies have become household names at the expense of the current crop? Oh, I think so. I mean, there used to be a narrative a couple of years ago that the FAANG companies, the Facebooks and Amazons and Apples and Google's and Netflix's, were too big to disrupt every two or three years. That is complete. That is proven to be completely wrong. Five years ago, very few people had heard of a company called TikTok. Now it is by far the hottest social media company in terms of downloads. And it is it has its rivals absolutely scrambling. In the last few months, one technology has freaked Google out completely. ChatGPT, artificial intelligence. Microsoft is reportedly investing up to 10 billion in it. The search industry and the search business and how we actually search for things online within the next 18 months might be completely different to what it has been in the last five to 10 years. If you're asking me for a 10 year prediction, I would say that it's it's almost certain that two or three of the big players who we cannot have imagined ever have living without at that time will be new companies. OK, Elaine, big tech companies, of course, are global concerns. Other regions of the world that will be affected more than others in these job cuts where wages and staff costs are higher, for example. And are we likely to see the center of gravity shift? All right, these they're global concerns, but they're mostly based in Silicon Valley. Do you think that these companies should now be looking over their shoulder at places like China and India, where the competition is likely to emerge and take their crown, if you like, as the behemoths of the tech industry? Absolutely. And as Adrian printed, that had happened with Tick Tock, where Silicon Valley maybe wasn't paying too much attention to Tick Tock until it completely exploded in their faces. And they suddenly were playing rival and on the back foot to this massive Chinese tech player. And China has produced some incredible tech companies that absolutely compete at the same level of those Silicon Valley giants. And there's no reason why India couldn't do that with the level of engineering and tech talent that comes out of India. And it could be a completely different landscape in the future where we don't speak about Silicon Valley the way that we do now as this innovation center. I think the gloss of that reputation has long been worn away and it is really losing face in the current context. And I think, as Adrian pointed out as well, this pivot to AI, what you might see is that the people who have been doing the work in AI before now, before this kind of appetite grew in the last couple of months because of the recent releases, they might have a much better understanding of this technology because there's a lot of ethical and bigger considerations that have to come before its implementation. What I'm afraid we'll see is that the big tech giants will panic and start implementing this stuff willy nilly without really taking us into consideration. And that could be to the detriment of all of us, including those companies. And Jim, the final question here, I've got about a minute in which you can answer this. Will the big companies themselves, Adrian, I think brought up regulators and anti-competitive practices, will the big companies themselves be able to survive? To what extent are they going to become too big for their own good and the regulators will split them up? You know, I've long thought antitrust is probably the biggest threat that these companies face, and that's probably still true. Although it is interesting, they can argue and say, hey, look, we just laid off 10,000 people. How big and how dominant and how, you know, how in control can we really be when we're doing this? So I think that actually will ease some of their regulatory concerns. And everybody is and should be concerned about job loss, including regulators. Right. And so that's the that's always been the their rebuttal is when you try to break us up. Well, you may not have these engines of growth anymore. You may lose high paying jobs, you know, all of those kinds of things. But I do think there are still substantial regulatory issues, antitrust. We should also mention you raise China, you know, authoritarian governments we know are on the rise around the world. So it's as successful and as powerful as Tiktok is. I don't think ultimately it's a technology choice as much as it is a geopolitical choice. It's entirely likely that Tiktok could end up banned in the US. And that's again, that's political, not not technology. Fascinating. Really enjoyed this discussion. Many thanks to all of you, Elaine Burke, Jim Anderson and Adrian Weckler.

James you have some breaking news from where you are, what's happening? Yes I'm by Damascus Gate in East Jerusalem but also in occupied East Jerusalem in the Silwan area we are getting reports of a shooting. We understand that two settlers have been shot. No information yet on the scale of their injuries, the severity of their injuries but that's news in the last half hour or so that two settlers have been shot here in East Jerusalem adding to a really tense situation. I can tell you that in the last few minutes we witnessed a couple of Palestinians who were walking down here, didn't appear to be doing anything to us at all, being snatched by the Israeli police, taken into their police checkpoint. They were then searched but we saw them being beaten as they were being searched. And moments later our camera operator was filming that and a settler came up to him and pushed him away and you're not allowed to be here and started pushing at his camera. So just an indication of how tense it is right now in East Jerusalem in this area after the events that we've seen in the last 48 hours, after what we saw with regard to the seven that were killed at the synagogue in the settlement in East Jerusalem but also what we saw in Jenin, that most deadly attack on Palestinians, ten people including an elderly woman killed in that attack. The violence is continuing I'm afraid, all the calls for restraint don't seem to be having the effect that those who've made the calls in the international community would like. And the latest incident reported, Silwan and two settlers we believe shot. We're obviously chasing more information from the various sources and we ourselves, as soon as we finish talking to you, we're going to go and head a little bit closer to Silwan to find out what we can. Okay, it certainly sounds like things are reaching a boiling point. We are getting some pictures in at the moment, these are the latest pictures of potentially that shooting so we'll cross back to you with more information once we get it. In the meantime James, Netanyahu is convening a security cabinet meeting on Saturday night to discuss a further response. Yes, we don't really know what the Israeli government are planning at this stage. What we do know is that the police presence, you can perhaps see there are some police officers just going past me now, that's increased, they're on now their highest state of alert and we understand that Israeli police officers have all been told now they're working a 12 hour shift. What we don't know is what more the Israeli government are going to do. We know that in the Mount of Olives, at the place where the man the Israeli police say was responsible for the attack on the synagogue, he was shot dead at the scene in his car, his parents have been questioned by Israeli police but also other neighbouring Palestinians who had come to the house, they were arrested, 42 in total arrested there. The security cabinet will meet, we think in Tel Aviv, at the defence ministry, probably, well certainly after sundown at the end of Shabbat, the end of the Sabbath here for Jews and what they will do I think is not entirely clear. One factor in all this is the fact there's a very high profile visit coming in the coming days and that's the US Secretary of State Antony Blinken who will be here on a pre-planned visit but clearly the violent situation will be top of his agenda. He's going first to Cairo, then in Jerusalem he's going to meet with Prime Minister Netanyahu and other key members of the new hardline Israeli government and also meet members of the Palestinian Authority we're told. So that may in some way be part of the calculations for the Israeli security cabinet because I don't think want to launch huge crackdown operations at a time when there is a visit by such a high ranking official and the Israeli and the US administration position is similar to that coming from the UN and the entire international community. They want restraint by all sides right now. Thank you very much James. Certainly many moving parts and as we were speaking to you for your knowledge we are seeing some what appears to be amateur vision, maybe phone vision of that scene in Silwan and potentially someone being loaded into an ambulance that had been either injured fatally or not. So that information is still coming in and we'll give it to you as we get it. All right let's cross to Gaza now where Imran Khan is standing by for us. Imran what's been the reaction by Palestinians to that synagogue shooting on Friday night? Well before I answer that question I'm just going to stop talking for a second. You might well be able to hear the mosque loudspeakers actually announcing that incident in Silwan. So that's some reaction coming there almost immediately as we were on air from the mosque announcing the death of the two settlers via the mosque loudspeakers. It's yet to be confirmed like exactly what they're saying. It's all in the distance but that's the kind of reaction that we've been seeing here in the Gaza Strip. Ghazem Qasem who's a spokesman for Hamas actually said that Friday's attack was a response to the crime committed by the occupation in Janine and a natural response to the occupation's criminal actions and that's echoed by all of the Palestinian factions across the Gaza Strip. They've all said pretty much the same thing. They've all said this was a swift and justified response to the events in Janine. On TikTok, on Instagram, on Facebook, on social media a lot of Palestinians have been showing solidarity with the occupied West Bank, with occupied East Jerusalem saying good the Israelis will think twice about killing Palestinians but with every single attack, with every single incident that happens in the West Bank there's fear here in Gaza. There's actually a saying here. What starts in the West Bank and the occupied West Bank actually finishes in Gaza and what they mean by that is oftentimes the Gaza Strip becomes a target because of the Palestinian factions here and when the Israelis cross a red line here and they start bombing not empty targets or targets they think they can get away with but strategic targets then Islamic Jihad for example or Hamas has to react that means rockets going as far as Tel Aviv like we saw in 2000 and 21 and a mass escalation. Now so far no one has claimed responsibility for this attack and indeed the attacker at this street near the synagogue had no Israeli security file on him he was actually shot dead but there was no known political affiliations either but what people here in the Gaza Strip are worried about that the Israeli government will come up with a political affiliation perhaps to Islamic Jihad, perhaps to Hamas and that means that they will react here in the Strip. Alright keep us posted as to what happens on the ground there Imran Khan live for us in Gaza thank you.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1250\n","\n","Link  204 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/QYyeoCMV7I4\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/QYyeoCMV7I4\n","[youtube] QYyeoCMV7I4: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] QYyeoCMV7I4: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 22.38MiB in 06:29\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Germany is under pressure to supply Ukraine with its most modern battle tanks. What's behind Germany's reluctance and why are tanks seen as so crucial in the war against Russia? This is Inside Story. Hello there and welcome to the program. I'm Nick Clark. Russia's invasion of Ukraine is nearing its second year and it's been a return to conventional warfare in Europe, something that would have been unimaginable 12 months ago. While the death toll mounts, the supply of military aid to Kiev has become an international political battle in itself. Germany is under pressure to allow the supply of its modern Leopard 2 tanks to Ukraine. The new defence minister gave little away in his first meeting with his US defence secretary counterpart, Lloyd Austin. And as often during history, but especially during these times, Germany and the US are standing together when acting, but also during concrete questions. Maybe the tanks, the Patriot air defence or multiple rocket launches. German systems are proving itself in Ukraine. Well, many world political and business figures have been meeting at the World Economic Forum in Davos, where the issue of German tanks for Ukraine has been hotly debated both on stage and on the sidelines. Our diplomatic correspondent, James Bays, reports on the discussions. The World Economic Forum at Davos looks at all the issues of the world. But among the EU and NATO leaders here, a lot of the discussions have been about Ukraine, of course, and about weapons for Ukraine. As President Zelensky addressed the World Economic Forum by video link, he called for more air defence, more tanks. And the focus has been very much on those tanks and very much on Germany. Germany has a main battle tank called the Leopard 2, but it's not just in German stocks. Germany has sold those tanks to many other EU and NATO countries. Some of those countries, notably Poland, would like to give some of their tanks to Ukraine. But under the export regulations, when Germany sold them, they have to get German permission. And that permission has not come so far. So a great deal of pressure on the German Chancellor, Olaf Scholz, who was here in Davos. He was asked specifically about the Leopard 2 tanks. He dodged the question. He said that Germany had provided a great deal of weaponry in the first year of this war. He said it would operate in lockstep with its allies. And I think that means very much the United States as well as the other NATO allies. And, of course, the U.S. hasn't said it's Abrams' main battle tank either to Ukraine, because it says it would be difficult for the Ukrainians to operate in the terrain that exists on the ground in Ukraine. Chancellor Scholz also saying that he wants to avoid at any cost a full all-out war between NATO and the NATO members and Russia. And so everything now moves, I think, after all the discussions all this week that have been taking place at Davos to Ramstein, that important meeting at the U.S. Air Base in Germany where defense ministers will be meeting to decide what now to give to Ukraine. James Bates, with that update from Davos, so let's take a closer look at the specs of the Leopard 2 tank. It's been upgraded several times since it was launched in 1979. Currently, it's used by 13 European armies. The Leopard 2 is valued for its maneuverability. It's lighter than other comparable models. The tank has recent battlefield experience. NATO forces in Afghanistan use them. And Leopard tanks that Germany has supplied to other nations require approval from Berlin before they can be re-exported to a third country. And that means the tanks cannot be sent to Ukraine without Germany's permission. All right, let's bring in our guests now. Joining us live from Wiltshire in the United Kingdom, retired British Major General Arthur Donaro. He's also a former Middle East adviser to the UK Ministry of Defense from London. Domitil Sagrimoso is a senior lecturer in security and development at King's College London and from Berlin, I'm pleased to say, Benares is joining us, the founder and editor in chief of BNE IntelliNews. A warm welcome to you all. General Donaro, if I may start with you, because I just want to examine just why there's such an intense focus on this issue of tanks. One might think that tanks are part of a bygone era, certainly to a layman anyway, because in this age of long range precision missiles, you'd think that they weren't as potent as they once were. But I presume that's not the case. They're still very valid on the battleground. Yes, very valid. Please bear in mind that you're listening to a very ancient armchair general and you need to take that with all the pinch of salt. So having tanks on the battlefield contributes to what we call the all arms battle. It's the integration of that all arms battle that makes an attacking force or a defending force much more potent. The Ukrainians have got some good tanks, but as we have seen, they're not that much better than the Russians. And we have seen how damaged the Russians tanks could be with this latest anti-tank weaponry that Ukraine's been supplied with. These modern tanks, particularly the Leopard, the Challenger and the Abrams, all have very sophisticated protection against most of these modern weaponry. And having them on the battlefield in support of the infantry and under the long range support of artillery and air is a game changer. Right. A game changer. In what quantity, General, would they be required to be a game changer, would you say? Yes, in reference to the very gallant offer of Britain's squadron of tanks, 14 tanks, we have to look at much greater numbers. Way back when we went to rescue Kuwait, to liberate Kuwait from Saddam Hussein's army, we had we the allies had thousands of tanks then. The British had over 150 there. So the offer of 14 is is very symbolic. And we were first there doing it. And we hope that this might pull the others in. And I hope it does, because 14 is not enough. Indeed. And Donatella, I think I'd be right in saying the tanks would be the most powerful direct weapon provided to Ukraine so far, even though at the moment the numbers fall some way short to what is required, certainly by Ukraine. Yes. And of course, to that we have to add the the Hamas, which have proven very effective as a sort of long range artillery system. So I think we shouldn't forget about about those as well. And what is interesting is how much the Hamas really helped to turn the tides in Ukraine's favor. So I think that this clearly shows that when tanks or other sort of Western military equipment is delivered to Ukraine, it can really have an impact on the battlefield. That's why the delivery of these tanks is so relevant. And I would agree with a previous speaker that it really would help to sort of assist Ukraine in trying to sort of carry out more effective offensive operations and also be able to operate more effectively in defensive positions as a kind of also some kind of mobile artillery force. And at the moment, I think this is very important and that it also comes together with additional artillery ammunition and also possibly fighter jets so that the whole combination of armed forces can operate in a more effective offensive manner. Right. And Ben Harris, what about the Russian capability? What would it mean for the Russian side of things if you know, large convoys of tanks joined a Ukrainian offensive? How would it change things? Do you think? I think it would be significant, as the general said, if enough tanks were sent in a in number to the battlefield. I mean, you have to put this into the context. Why is this coming up now? And the battle now has sort of ground down to a stalemate. I mean, in September, we had this remarkable offensive, counteroffensive by the Ukrainians in the Harkiv region. And they broke through the Russian defenses and then went like a knife through butter, pushing them back, liberating hundreds of kilometers. And then shortly at the end of that month, they recaptured Kerson as well. But now, now the fighting has come down. The Russians have done their partial mobilization. They brought 300,000 fresh troops into the into the field. And the front line is stabilized. And, you know, the epicenter of the fighting now is around bar moods in the Donbass region and solid are which apparently has just fallen to to the Russian side. But that fight at Buckwood has been going on for months, and we're talking, you know, a couple of meters a day, if that and it goes backwards and forwards. And so the two sides now butting heads, but nobody has the advantage. If you were to bring in these powerful tanks, these offensive weapons, then that would make a huge difference if you bring them in in enough number, because then you can smash through the you can go on the offensive and attack the Russian defenses and push them back. Poland President Duda Davos yesterday called on the West to send 100 of these leopard twos. And I think there are around 2000 of them scattered throughout Europe. Poland itself has about 250 and 100 leopards on the field would make all the difference. Because, again, as the general said that there are about 20 tons heavier than anything the Russians have got the two seventy twos, which is the workhorse of the Russian side. And the armor on them is significant. And Russia doesn't have things like the American made javelins that the Ukrainians had in order to take these tanks out so that they would be a real game changer. And I think that's what people are looking at is like they're getting frustrated at this deadlock. 100000 people have died on both sides with no one making any progress. And so the Ukrainians are saying right enough with the defensive weapons with the Patriots with the javelins that you sent us. These have been very useful. Give us some offensive weapons so that we can actually win this war and push the Russians back over the 1991 borders. OK. And General we've been alluded to it just then. But any big scale offensive would need by Ukraine that is would need to be backed up by air and ground support. Yes, that. And of course the tank gives the ground forces maneuverability, which as Ben's just told us, you know, has ground to a halt in order to maneuver. We've got to have mobile, well protected, hard hitting firepower. And the only thing that can deliver that is the tank and the leopard is is perfectly formed for that one. And of course, it's handy by. So it's it's not going to take long to get it into Ukraine. And and it is relatively easy to operate compared to some aspects, certainly of Abrams and and of our challenger. But it's the maneuverability and the protection that that affords this very hard hitting bit of kit that makes it such a potent force. All right. So that's the kind of the battlefield landscape. Donatella, why do you think Germany has been just so reticent, so reluctant in committing to providing these German made tanks? Well, first of all, it's important to know that the reluctance has come primarily from the chancellor, all of Schultz. I think he and others in his party are very worried about about an escalation, about the potential conflict between Russia and NATO and Germany being involved in that. And now I think a bit exaggerated because, you know, Germany could even start by authorizing the delivery of these levels by those countries which have them already. And that wouldn't necessarily involve Germany itself. There is a lot of concern in Germany of being seen, you know, in certain quarters as being seen as being sort of part of enough of our so-called offensive. But I think that is really the wrong approach. But there is, I think, a very strong, in a way, sort of pacifist tradition in Germany. And what is interesting is that all of Schultz, you know, in his youth, really was part of this pacifist tradition. And he was sort of very much as an anti-NATO politician, although, you know, he evolved a lot throughout his political career. And as we know, he gave his famous speech on, you know, at the start of the war in Ukraine, where he talked about, you know, how Germany had to change its course and rearm again the face of the Russian threat. But at the same time, I think there is a very strong reluctance and I think he's probably looking at public opinion, which is slowly shifting and there is increasing support for so-called freeing the leopards. But I think that, you know, deep inside, I think it's very reluctant to see Germany because of its history during the Second World War and also during the Cold War when Germany was divided, occupied by the Soviet Union. And Germany could be a potential theater of war, you know, that this can repeat itself. So there is a very sort of ingrained deep historical sort of narrative that is strong in certain quarters in Germany that in a way is putting a break. But I think that he's, you know, the chancellor is increasingly under pressure from inside his own coalition by members of the Green Party and the FTP. Let me just bring Ben in there. There are some contradictions here, aren't there, because you have this kind of this German reluctance. But on the other hand, back in February last year, Olaf Scholz was, you know, announcing this historical turning point for Germany to ramp up its defenses, which many said that was, you know, something extraordinary since they haven't done that since World War Two. And even today, we're hearing about the new German defense minister talking up Germany's need to strengthen defenses. Yeah, but the key word there is defense. And what we're talking about here is a war with Russia, which is, you know, the tanks are offensive weapons. And let's step back and understand the context of this and why. I mean, as Donatella said, of course, Germany has this history. I mean, it uniquely, almost uniquely in Europe has fought the Russians and lost and doesn't want to repeat that experience. And they're more sensitive than anybody else. But the overriding goal of NATO in general and Germany in particular is not to help the Ukrainians beat the Russians first and foremost. It's first and foremost is to prevent a world war, to prevent a direct conflict between NATO and Russia. No one wants to go there. And that's one of the reasons why we've been pouring in defensive weapons in order to make sure that Ukraine doesn't lose this war, which is not quite the same thing as making sure it wins this war. And we've now reached the point with the stalemate where everyone is getting frustrated and hundreds of thousands of people are dying. So there's now a push to abandon that and to give Ukraine some offensive weapons to actually change the balance. And the reason why Germany in particular is so nervous because it's unpredictable how the Kremlin will react. So far, Putin's indicated that he hasn't got a problem with NATO supplying defensive weapons in so much as that Russia still has the advantage on the field, both in terms of artillery and men, and that he can just grind the Ukrainians down. And if you put offensive weapons that change the tide of the war into Ukraine's advantage, then all the new really scary possibilities, including tactical nuclear weapons, appear. And that's really what's behind this hesitancy. And it's not just Germany. I mean, Jan Stoltenberg from NATO said right at the beginning of this conflict, our top priority is to avoid World War Three. Our second priority is to help Ukraine defend itself. And it's doing an amazing job, something that nobody was expecting. Right. General Denari, do you concur with that? Or, you know, there is the other argument that defeat for Ukraine, that in itself could lead to World War Three. Yes, it could. And it's incredibly difficult to predict which way it's going to fall and whether the supply of these tanks, which are in the main aim offensive, but also hugely useful in any form of defensive posture, is going to affect that balance. And I'm finding it very difficult to predict that. And so, Ben, we talked about the United States there and Germany themselves have said that, you know, the US haven't sent any tanks in. If they do, then we will. Why do you think the US is reticent as well? It's the same fears. I mean, nobody wants to start a third world war with Russia because then it all becomes extremely unpredictable and becomes extremely scary with the nuclear exchange between the major powers. And the Americans, too, have also followed this policy of supplying largely defensive weapons, the peer pressure amongst Europeans. And you've got some countries in Europe, like the Polish and the Baltic States in particular, that are very anti-Russian, very pro-Ukraine, want to see these heavy weapons put in. And others sitting on the fence and people like Hungary, of course, are friends with Putin. But for the Americans, I mean, Schulz is trying to pass the buck. He's getting a lot of pressure from all the other EU members, particularly the more aggressive ones, to send these tanks. And Germany has the largest defense sector in Europe. And so everybody's got German weapons and you can't export them to Ukraine without German permission. And Schulz said this week, I think it was just yesterday, that if the Americans send the Abraham tanks, their tanks, then Germany will follow suit. And so he's passing the buck to the Americans. But then the Americans have said, and I think your reporter said that they're reluctant to send their tanks, too, because they're not suitable in the terrain. You know, we're talking about huge, flat agricultural land. This is like the perfect terrain for the tanks. And ideal, and moreover necessary because there's so little cover. So it sounds a bit like an excuse. And again, on the English side, the UK side, rather, they've sent 14 tanks, which is a gesture. Like the general said, you have to send much, much more. 50, 100 tanks would make a difference. So we're not seeing that, too. So everyone's pulling their punches. I think at Ramstein tomorrow, what we'll see is that Schulz will cave to the pressure that he's under. But there'll be a token gesture of a dozen efforts that will be sent from Poland, say, in order to take the pressure off to do something more to help the Ukrainians. But again, not going far enough, not sending up a battalion of 100 tanks that would actually make a big difference on the battlefield because of the fear of provoking Russia to go to the next level, doing mass mobilization, putting a million people into the field and overrunning Ukraine and then start taking out ammo dumps in Poland or really extreme reactions like that. And Dometilla, just coming back to this point about a potential Russian defeat, especially in the light of what the former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev has said, that the defeat of a nuclear power in a conventional war may trigger a nuclear war. Well, I think that they've been threatening the use of nuclear war now for several months, even before the start of the war. Putin was talking about this risk if there was an attempt on Crimea by the Ukrainians. I think that, you know, we have to take that into consideration, but it shouldn't be a sort of a self deterrent. I think that we have to be cautious, but I think that it would be highly unlikely that Russia sort of starts sort of a major nuclear exchange with the West. I mean, there is a possibility they could use, of course, tactical nuclear weapons. But I mean, what would they really achieve? And I think that the Americans have made it clear that if there is a use of tactical nuclear weapons in Ukraine, the Americans and NATO would intervene, even with conventional forces, and there would be a very high risk to the regime of President Putin. So I think that often many of these statements are anti threats, but they have to be taken seriously. And as the previous speakers noted, you know, the question of escalation is in everyone's mind. So, you know, there is caution. But at the same time, you know, we now have to consider that we are at the sort of turning point because Russia is ready to mobilize a very high number of soldiers. It is engaging its own its entire sort of economic infrastructure and industrial infrastructure towards the war effort, the production of tanks that, you know, and other kinds of military equipment that could be potentially useful very much to Russia in the back end field. OK, we're just running out of time. We want to finally come to General Denaro. Sending all these munitions to Ukraine, it crosses my mind that it's not just depleting countries of their own defense capability. And doesn't it make the world a more dangerous place in that sense, too? I don't think so. What I think really is important here is that a speed of decision making, because there's no doubt that to change the whole tempo of this conflict and to get it resolved, we need to support the Ukrainians with tanks and the Americans can send us in in smaller numbers because clearly the distances and also the training on the Abrams is more difficult. The British have already planned to send a squadron and the real answer is for the Leopards to be supplied by the various countries who've got them because they're there on the borders, ready to go, and they are much easier really to operate. All right, we'll watch closely how this pans out in the coming days. We have to leave it there. Thank you to all our guests, Arthur Denaro, Dmitriy Sagromoso and Ben Aris.

Two gladiators competing for the first Grand Slam of the year. It was Rabakina who started strongest, Kazakhstan's star, looking for her second major title in seven months after winning Wimbledon last year. She took the opening set six games to four. It was the first set Zabalenka had dropped in 2023, but she began to settle down in what was her first major final. The fifth seed had won her previous three meetings with Rabakina and she took the second set six-three to square things up. That effectively set up a one-set shootout for the trophy and the momentum stayed with Zabalenka. She got the crucial break and soon found herself serving for the match. She failed to convert three championship points, but at the fourth time of asking, she finally got over the line. It's the first Grand Slam title for the 24-year-old. Because of Belarus' support of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, she wasn't allowed to officially represent her country in Melbourne, meaning she's the first ever neutral player to win a tennis Grand Slam. It's the first tennis major to offer equal prize money to the men and women. So as well as the trophy, Zabalenka takes home around two million dollars. And once again, thank you guys for an amazing atmosphere. I hope next year I come back stronger and I'll show you even better tennis and you guys support me even more. Thank you. Zabalenka's 11th straight win of the year sees her return to a career-high world number two ranking.

Demonstrators have rallied across Bangladesh for months, blaming it for failing to stop soaring energy and food prices. Prices are very high in the market now and it's becoming hard for us to get by with what we earn. We want the government to bring down the prices so ordinary people can manage it. And many of what he calls ordinary people are not members of the political parties. I came to see for myself how large these opposition rallies are and I'm surprised to see how large they are. The opposition alliance says it will continue to press its standpoint demand, which includes the government's resignation. It also wants power transferred to a non-partisan caretaker administration before the next general election. Tens of thousands of leaders and activists of several opposition parties are taking part in rallies across the country and here in Noyapaltan in the capital Dhaka. Public anger is also growing over what many see as excessive spending on ambitious development projects and there are accusations of corruption and cronyism. The government is always talking about development. People can very well understand these are lies. We're suffering, prices of food are so high, we can't even talk freely and openly against this without being silenced. The government remains defiant. Rights group accused of stifling free speech and increasing attacks, arrest and intimidation of opposition members. And the Prime Minister had this warning for the protesters. Awami League works for the people and for the welfare of the people, so it is not that easy to push the Awami League out of power. But the Awami League is very capable of overthrowing anyone from power who has rigged or stolen votes. We've proven that. Analysts fear rising inflation, high fuel costs and a protracted Ukraine war will continue to affect the economy in Bangladesh and the country will likely see more protests and unrest in the coming weeks and months.

Timelines overflow with eulogies to its victims, search engines, copywriters, coders, high school essays, and many more. Now, reports of these impending deaths may be exaggerated. Human beings love to write the words, this will change everything, only to shrug a year later when this changed very little. ChatGPT might be a game changer, it might not be. Either way, the bot is undeniably impressive. What really astounds is its rhetorical muscle, its ability to generate paragraphs of coherent argument or narrative. Obviously there are several million humans to which it can't hold a candle in this regard, but it instantly hurtled several million others, landing somewhere in the neighborhood of a high school student who's perfectly happy with a B- on their Pride and Prejudice book report. 20 years ago, that was my neighborhood. If I had access to ChatGPT in 10th grade English, I would have used it without compunction. Why waste a perfectly good afternoon scratching out a five paragraph essay on Austin's depictions of social class when I could generate this in seconds? In America, we don't call this cheating, we call it working smarter. Maybe the eulogies are fitting, maybe we'll outsource writing to ChatGPT like we outsourced math to calculators, spelling to spell check, memory to the internet. To a certain extent, the prevalence of essay writing in school reflects the decline of memorization as a method of teaching and learning. A decline that feels inevitable, maybe even appropriate in a world where the totality of human knowledge is pocket sized. We assign essays because they allow teachers to gauge a deeper understanding in their students. They require more than just recall, they require a personal synthesis of information which can't be outsourced to a machine, or couldn't be until a few weeks ago. Pretty soon English teachers are going to get that question math teachers have been getting for decades. When will we ever need this stuff in real life? Bullshit won't work here, teens are just too savvy for that. The truth is that you'll probably never have to calculate a definite integral once you leave school. The truth is we'll likely outsource many categories of basic writing to AI and never look back. For other, more complex kinds of writing, you could simply start with ChatGPT, let it provide the basic structure, then edit to your liking. Editing after all is another way to synthesize information. Maybe ours will become a culture of editors, tweakers, embellishers. Would that be so bad? The insipid teenage me would probably say no, but the 34-year-old me, the one who ironically became a professional essayist, leans the opposite way. The difference between writing and editing is like the difference between writing and reading. Reading is enormously important, obviously. It closes the gaps of our ignorance and expands our knowledge, but it does so through the language of others, their words, their sentences, their narratives and arguments. Editing too begins with the language of someone else. In the case of ChatGPT, something else. Of course, to some extent, writing is editing too. We inherit our language and its rules from culture, from the past. We express ourselves through a system that we didn't invent. But that system is so infinitely flexible that we can use it to create structures of our own. Language is how human beings understand themselves and the world. But writing is how we understand uniquely. Not to write is to live according to the language of others, or worse, to live through edits, tweaks and embellishments to language generated by an overconfident AI chatbot. I doubt this argument would convince the teenage me to resist a free magic tool that promises easy grades for less work. As ever, it's left to teachers to impassion their students within a system that prioritizes grades over learning. Often they succeed, but even when they don't, they still do the heroic work of giving insipid high schoolers like myself basic writing competence. In my twenties, when I began to wonder who I really was and what I really believed, questions that come for all of us, I discovered that writing, structuring language of my own, was the only way to find out. That's when the foundation teachers worked so hard to give me proved its immense value. I hope future generations have a similar foundation. One way or another, new writing is on its way from the future to make sense of all of us. I think we'll prefer it to be our own. Hey everybody, thank you so much for watching this whole year.

More on that after the video....and that would be that. So, it's not black and white. It's not really clear. I've heard you're saying you got ten movies in you. Peter Travers was scandalized, his pitch climbing with every word. He gestured with panicky hands and repeated the question just to be sure. And this is it after ten? That's kind of what you're talking about. The man is clearly befuddled, and he's not the only one. Are you really only going to make one more movie? Are you really only going to make two more movies after this one? You've said that you might retire after your tenth. Is that... Are you serious about that? Do you regret vowing that you'd only make ten movies? What is this nonsense about you're only going to make one more movie? Woe unto thee, O Israel! You have sinned a great sin in the sight of God! Peter Travers and the rest just can't accept that someone like Tarantino would impose retirement on himself. While he's still relatively young, still in fighting shape, while he has the kind of creative freedom few filmmakers ever enjoy. It goes against a basic rule of success in Hollywood. Once you've arrived at the party, hang around until someone tells you to leave. Unaccustomed to people who flout this rule, they assume he's bluffing or misguided. Maybe both. After all, how many people fight their entire careers for an invite to the party and never get one? How many enter, then immediately get shown the door? Few leave by choice. Fewer still are begged to stay. That's essentially what these reporters are doing, begging Tarantino to carry on, to entertain us for a little while longer. Must be one hell of an ego boost. What have I left undone? Now while I'm sure Tarantino loves to hear talk show hosts plead for more, he has better reasons for early retirement. I like the idea that there is an umbilical cord connected to my first film all the way to my last, and then that is the body of work. Because I am about my filmography, and frankly I do feel that a bad film on the filmography affects good films. I like the idea of doing a body of work. Ten movies and then, okay, that's it, that's what I have to say. And let that filmography just stand for itself. Quentin Tarantino thinks in oeuvres. Oeuvres. Oeuvres. The fancy and hard to pronounce French word for body of work. That in itself doesn't make him unique. Most artists consider the arc of their life's work, especially when that life nears its end. They might look back and discover some big themes in their career. They might try to divide it into phases or even agree to a retrospective. It's natural to think about legacy. And the most lasting legacies usually come from oeuvres, not single works. Shakespeare, Picasso, The Beatles, Beyoncé, Dickens, Hitchcock, Morrison, Miyazaki. Tarantino would love to join this list, as many other artists would. Like many other artists, he'll submit his oeuvre to posterity for consideration. What makes Tarantino a little unusual is that while most artists look back at their body of work, he's been carefully shaping his own from the start. Just as great movies shouldn't have weak scenes, great filmographies shouldn't have weak movies. That's what Tarantino believes. He's eager to avoid the major minor game that film nerds like me play with revered filmmakers. Shutter Island is minor Scorsese, we might say, compared to major works like Raging Bull and Taxi Driver. Girl 6 is minor Spike Lee next to Malcolm X and Do the Right Thing. These minor movies often appear toward the end of a career. Alfred Hitchcock's final five films barely register against his many masterpieces. Lopping them off the filmography wouldn't diminish his reputation. In fact, Tarantino might argue that Hitchcock's legacy would be even greater today if he walked away from cinema in 1963 and not 1976. Artists don't always notice when their skills are flagging, so Tarantino is leaving early to prevent crossing that line unwittingly. Ten movies are enough for a good, healthy filmography, and the nine he's made so far are all pretty good. Not all of his movies are masterpieces, but I personally don't think Tarantino's made any real clunkers. That's my opinion, of course. You're welcome to disagree, something film nerds love to do. You might not be a fan of Tarantino or my opinion of him, but for the purposes of this essay, you don't have to be. I'm less interested in the quality of his movies than in his perspective on what he or any artist might gain by thinking of their career holistically. It's clear Tarantino sees a reputational value in having a body of work that maintains a high standard. But is there a value to the work itself? Can a well-designed filmography bestow greater meaning onto the films that make it up? Can a body of work be a work of art? Now that was just the first part of a three-part or three-chapter essay in my new book. The essay is called Thinking in Uvras, and in chapters two and three, I answer that question. Can a body of work be a work of art? And how? If you're interested in reading that and ten other essays, pick up Escape into Meaning, which is out today. You can get this today.

And the moth says, what's the problem? Where do I begin, man? Norm MacDonald is one of those comedians who functions as a litmus test for people's sense of humor. If you find Norm hilarious, for example, I know that your sense of humor and mine are probably pretty similar. Norm splits people. And if he does so more than most, I think it's because his vision of comedy is unflinching, unflinchingly devoted to what he finds funny, which means that he won't ever try to modify his work to appease an audience. Of course, this has led to what I think is the mistaken notion, one that you often see in YouTube comments, that Norm just doesn't care what people think. You know, as I go to work for Gregory Alinovich, honestly, Doc, I don't even know what I'm doing anymore. I don't even know if Gregory Alinovich knows. He only knows that he has power over me. And that seems to bring him happiness. I think Norm cares deeply about his audiences. He wouldn't spend thousands of hours honing his material if he didn't want to make people laugh. He just doesn't let the audience dictate the direction of his work. He doesn't pander. In fact, during his time at SNL as the host of Weekend Update, he often did the exact opposite. Norm's distaste for performing in front of an audience that was essentially forced to laugh urged him to tell jokes that would shock them into silence or gasps. A decade before Ricky Gervais made a splash by making fun of celebrities at the Golden Globes, Norm hosted the ESPYs with jokes like this. He became the first defensive player to win the Heisman Trophy. And congratulations, Charles. That is something that no one can ever take away from you, unless you kill your wife and a waiter, in which case... Not only does that take bravery, it takes dedication. At night, I sometimes wake up and I turn to some old lady in my bed that's on my arm. A lady that I once loved, Doc. I don't know where it turned to. My youngest, Alexandria. LAUGHTER She fell in the cold of last year. Norm's dedication to the craft is almost inhuman, and so much of it is unseen. He's one of the smartest, well-read people in stand-up, particularly well-read in Russian literature, if you couldn't tell by the names that he's making up in the moth joke. And yet his whole act is predicated on this folksy, dopey innocence. He's like that magician from The Prestige who devotes his whole life to a character just to pull off a great trick. This is the trick. This is the performance. Right here. This is why no one can detect his method. Total devotion to his art. Art of self-sacrifice. And my other boy... LAUGHTER And this is the hardest pill to swallow, Doc. My other boy, Gregorio... LAUGHTER...Ivanovich. LAUGHTER I no longer love him. Norm's not trying to pull off tricks, of course. He's trying to pull off jokes, a joke with a premise and a punchline. It's kind of funny. Norm was known for his super short jokes during his weekend update period, and now he's known for these super long, rambling jokes that he often tells on late-show appearances. It's these longer jokes which bear a resemblance to shaggy dog stories that often get him labelled as an anti-comic or a metacomic. But he strongly insists that he is neither of these things. In interviews, Norm rejects anything that sees itself as above comedy, looking down on it either to ridicule or to comment. His jokes always have punchlines, and punchlines that make sense whether or not you think they're funny. He can deliver a joke quickly... Hey, you know the funniest part of doing an office conga line? LAUGHTER...when you look back and realise you're doing it alone and you're not in an office, you're in a psychiatric hospital. LAUGHTER...or he can string out punchlines like pearls on a wire across a long story. This joke from his special Me Doing Stand-Up is 12 minutes long. Seems like there's too much news, like, you know, because now they have 24-hour news. Now, when I was a young boy, the news was half an hour. That was the whole news. He starts by talking about 24-hour news and eventually makes his way to a detailed description of how he would murder someone. And the progression is completely natural. And then I would take her body to the woods and bury her in a very, very, very deep grave. LAUGHTER Along the way, there was plenty of punchlines to laugh at, and as things get crazier, you get drawn into a kind of hysteria. A lady has vanished! Matter of fact, I'm kind of happy it's Janice and not somebody I know. LAUGHTER I would like to meet her one day. That would be a lot of... Fuck, I forgot she vanished. Every time, they will find you in a, uh, shallow grave. LAUGHTER These serial killers are supposed to be so shrewd and cunning and everything, you know? But then when it comes time for the grave... LAUGHTER...they get a little hasty, you know? LAUGHTER What I would do is I would, like, I would look at the lady, I would select a lady, and then I would follow her habits. You understand what I'm saying? What would I be holding in my right hand in the parking lot? But a cheese sandwich. LAUGHTER I got a whole fucking van full of them over it. I would get her in there and I would do that thing that makes me feel like God. And then I would take her body to the woods and bury her in a very, very, very deep grave. LAUGHTER The intelligence of this joke is there, if you want to look for it. The word choices, the phrasing, it's all precisely chosen. But Norm doesn't call attention to his own intelligence. The punch lines just appear like flashes of light. If only the cowardice was stronger, then perhaps... LAUGHTER Perhaps I could bring myself to reach over to that cocked and loaded gun that lays on the bedside behind me. LAUGHTER And then this hellish facade... How long a drive was this? In the constellation of comedy greats, Norm is among the least famous, but he's also one of the most underrated. That's because stand-up was never a stepping stone for him to greater success or greater fame, but an end in itself, an art to perfect. His kind of comedy is built to last, like a low-frequency noise that might not demand the same kind of attention as high-pitched sounds, but will travel a much greater distance in the end. And Norm's jokes are the ones you'll remember late into your life, the ones we'll all be telling for years to come. Because their construction is sophisticated, but their delivery is easy to understand. Getting that balance exactly right is the work of an entire career. But Norm MacDonald, more than anyone else, knows that a long, winding journey is OK, as long as the payoff is worth it. He says, duck. LAUGHTER Sometimes I feel like a spider, even though I'm a moth. LAUGHTER Just barely hanging on to my web with an everlasting fire underneath me. I'm not feeling good. And so the moth... the doctor says, Moth, man, you're troubled. But you should be seeing a psychiatrist. Why on earth did you come here? And then the moth said, Because the light was on. LAUGHTER APPLAUSE MUSIC Hey, everybody.

Let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments. Love is not love which alters when it alteration finds, or bends with the remover to remove. Oh no, it is an ever-fixed mark that looks on tempests and is never shaken. It is the star to every wandering bark whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken. Love's not time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks within his bending sickle's compass come. Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks, but bears it out even to the edge of doom. If this be error and upon me proved, I never writ, nor no man ever loved. That was Sonnet Number 116 by Shakespeare, published in 1609. It's his most famous sonnet, which probably makes it the most famous sonnet in history. Typical of the form, the subject here is romantic love, and it follows the typical metrical pattern as well, 14 lines of iambic pentameter, three quatrains, then a couplet with the rhyme scheme ABAB, CDCD, EFEF, GG. The poem has a pristine surface, and reading it, hearing it, you can grasp its theme with ease. True love's permanence in a world that's impermanent. It's the kind of poem you might hear somebody read at a wedding or quote in a movie. Take me not to the marriage of true minds, admit impediments. Love is not love, which alters when its alteration finds or bends with the remover to remove. Sonnet 116 is carefully designed to give you the impression that you understand what it's saying. But look a little closer, and this sonnet proves to be much more slippery and strange than it initially seems. The sonnet begins with a somewhat curious line, let me not to the marriage of true minds admit impediments. Admit. What does he mean by that word? It's unclear. It could mean that he'll protect a marriage of two minds from the impediments that seek to destroy it. It could mean that he refuses to acknowledge impediments. Or it could mean that he won't confess to impediments even if he knows some. The ambiguity is unsettling, and that feeling is immediately augmented by the second half of line two. Love is not love, which is contradictory and really meaningless. Of course, this is only the beginning of a full sentence, but where a poet puts his line breaks is always significant. The second sentence begins a definition of love, which is the central aim of the poem. But it does this not by saying what love is, but what it's not. Love is not something that changes when it confronts changes, either in the lover or the world. It's not something that leaves even when a lover does. But notice that I'm paraphrasing here, which is something that the sonnet is forcing me to do. I just mentioned the lovers and the world. But these things are conspicuously absent from the poem, which is one of its oddest qualities. Sonnets are often written for someone, to someone, a beloved. But there is no one here. No one but the speaker. As Jane Roessner points out, the first quatrain is entirely, radically abstract. In the second quatrain, we move from negative to positive definitions, getting a little more concrete, but not much. Love is an ever-fixed mark and a star. The mark may be a sea mark, a beacon anchored in or near the water to aid navigation. Like stars aid navigation to sailors in their ships, their wandering barks. A star may be a guide, but it's also distant and remote, unreachable. What good is this ideal of changeless love to real people who are destined to change, to wander, to fail, to grow? In the third quatrain, Shakespeare descends further and we catch our first glimpse of a human being, here, the rosy lips and cheeks of youth that fade in time. Except they don't fade in the poem. They're caught in time's bending sickle. Who else do we know who carries one of those? It's a somewhat gruesome image that's a little too easy to picture. But no matter. Love is not time's fool. Love doesn't change. Love bears it out. To where? The edge of doom. For a poem that promised not to admit impediments, it seems like we're running into them at every turn. In fact, Sonnet 116 is invaded by negatives, like weeds sprouting in a flowerbed. Finally, the couplet, another point made in the negative. If he's wrong about love, well, then he's never written a word and no one has ever loved. But since people clearly have loved and since we've just been reading words he's written, we're supposed to conclude that he can't be wrong. But it's a paradoxical way to put it because if he is in error, a possibility he seems to acknowledge, well, that would negate the very ideal of love itself, taking the poem along with it into oblivion. In Sonnet 116, Shakespeare constantly undermines the easy assumptions we make about it. We're not hearing a love poem for someone. We're not even hearing a poem about the supposed permanence of love. We're hearing a speaker in a void trying to convince himself that love is somehow different than every other thing in the ephemeral universe and not succeeding. You get the sense of someone closing their eyes really hard, refusing to admit a truth that permeates the sonnet despite itself, that love is as erratic and fluid and volatile as the people who feel it. This doesn't mean that true love, the marriage of true minds, is any less real or any less beautiful. It's the opposite, in fact, something Shakespeare knew very well. Beauty belongs to what's impermanent and we cherish the most the things we can lose. Hey, everybody. Thanks for watching. This episode was sponsored by The Remarkable 2 Tablet.

It's probably impossible for us to get into that frame of mind to a time before TV, film, photography, and TikTok when the only visual arts depicting the human form were painting and sculpture. In the 16th century, the art world in Italy and beyond had seen the high renaissance with its paintings devoted to ideal beauty, linear perspective, and balanced compositions yield to mannerism and its exaggerated forms, strange juxtapositions, complex, sometimes overly sophisticated paintings that emphasized the artist's talents and fanciful impulses. Then you walk into a church in Rome and see this. It must have been shocking, maybe even too much to handle for some. It's dramatic, crystal clear, so, I don't know, so visceral that you feel exposed, vulnerable, involved. It's Caravaggio's The Calling of St. Matthew. You're seeing the moment that Jesus Christ calls Matthew, the tax collector, to be his disciple. As it says in Matthew 9, Jesus saw a man named Matthew sitting at the tax collector's booth. Follow me, he told him, and Matthew got up and followed him. In the scripture, it's an immediate reaction, but Caravaggio inserts a moment here, a moment of hesitation. Jesus enters what looks like a tavern, obscured by St. Peter and almost entirely in shadow except for his hand, arm, the side of his face, and the slightest glimmer on the halo over his head. He points out Matthew, who instead of getting up and going like the gospel says, points at himself as if to say, who? Me? To the left of him, two of his fellow money men don't even realize a divine presence has arrived, consumed by their worldly matters. To Matthew's right, two young men are startled in opposite directions, one leaning toward Jesus and one leaning away, amplifying Matthew's moment of indecision. The scene makes sense right away, but Caravaggio goes much further than just intelligibility. What really shocks about this painting is, of course, the light. The intensely dramatic play of light and shadow called Chiaroscuro, or when it's so pronounced like this, tenebrism. The harsh light coming from the upper right of the canvas, like divine illumination, points out Matthew more forcefully than Jesus does. But it's not unrealistic. The opposite in fact. It's the kind of light we know. We've seen it before. That color, that angle, it triggers our memories of late afternoon sunlight when we're reminded how dramatic reality really is. And what's more light from that side angle removes the need to add background space to simulate three dimensions. The way it wraps around the characters does that job just as well, so that Caravaggio can put a flat wall or a dark space behind his scene, and his figures pop out like they're on a stage or in a dreamlike void, a kind of hyper reality. See how he achieves the same effect in this painting, Judith beheading Hello Ferenes, or David with the head of Goliath, or the crucifixion of St. Peter, or my personal favorite, the taking of Christ, which was only rediscovered in 1990, by the way. I mean, it's like you're there crowded in that group. You can hear the metal of the knight's armor, the scream of St. John fleeing. You can feel Judas's hand on Jesus's arm, his kiss as he betrays his friend. You're caught up in it. You know, it's worth noting that this is exactly the kind of painting that the Catholic Church wanted during the Counter-Reformation as it pushed back against Protestantism. One of the Council of Trent's decrees was that art should strive to help Christians understand and reconnect with their faith. With so many illiterate people, painting was a crucial way to transmit the stories of Catholic doctrine. And Caravaggio's work is not only easily understandable, it stirs deep emotion in its immediacy. It puts passion into the passion of Jesus. Obviously Caravaggio's other great innovation was in his casting of real people in these biblical roles. He painted from life, so his Mary Magdalene, for example, was someone you might see walking the streets of Rome in the year 1600. To some, this realism was vulgar. But to others, looking for humanity in these stories, Caravaggio's figures were revelatory, heightening the feelings of identification and involvement that the Church wanted from art. The key, of course, is that Caravaggio himself was a deeply sinful person. By all accounts, a complete jerk, given to street brawls and petulant outbursts which often resulted in jail time. In 1606, he killed a man in a duel and was forced to flee Rome. He bounced around Italy after that, getting in trouble everywhere he went, until he finally died, we think, of illness in 1610 at age 38. No doubt his penchant for violent extremes contributed to the haunting renderings of violence in his work. But the romantic stereotype of the mad and frenzied artist who dies before his time is a tired one. And you can't help but wonder what he might have shown us had he just calmed down and lived twice as long. Because what we have got is extraordinary. You can see that he was grappling with his sins and his faith in his work. In The Taking of Christ, for example, he paints himself into the scene, rushing in with the words, eager to witness the betrayal, the arrest of Jesus. He holds a lantern signifying the power of the artist to illuminate the stories that mean the most to us, to make them personal, realer than real. Maybe it is possible to know what it was like for people to see a Caravaggio painting for the first time in 1605. His light has traveled 400 years through time undimmed. Against it, we're just as defenseless as they were. Hey everybody, thank you so much for watching. This episode was brought to you by Squarespace.

Scary, vindictive. Wait, sorry. Uh, no, no, no, no, none of this. I'm not actually saying that. Yet. Would you like this meeting to be on background? You can't say I said anything. You did. So I rewatched both seasons of Succession with the intention of doing a video on the hilariously weird poetry in the show's dialogue. You know, stuff like, What up, pricklycks? It's me, Dr. Moron. I'm a ding dong doodle bug dipshit with a tit mouse dick and my dad hates all of you. Fuck you go bye bye, how was that? Was that good? And while there is plenty of majestically profane wordplay to celebrate, watching the show all in one sitting like that, I couldn't help but recognize some deeper themes, also to do with language and speech, that kept popping up again and again. Yeah, it was words. Words are just, what, nothing. Complicated airflow. What I found was that Succession is an extended exploration of this statement, but in the form of a question. The show wants to know, are words just nothing? Gusts of complicated airflow that you can't really use to understand who someone is or what they mean. Well, in a lot of cases, yes. Succession is packed with examples of words that have absolutely no meaning at all. I don't at this time recall anything that at that time would have caused me any real concern. Lester was a man. And when a man dies, it is sad. All of us will die one day. In this case, it is Lester who has done so. These are words designed to be empty, so that they can fulfill the act of communicating when saying something is required without making the speaker responsible for content. You hear this kind of stuff a lot in politics and business. Sometimes it's necessary to be cagey, since statements from powerful people can affect the world. Other times, jargon is just rapping on bullshit. Family ownership and corporate continuity in the digital age. Whatever the fuck that means. All these nothing words are a form of insincerity. And in this show, this world, this family, insincerity is the rule, not the exception. That doesn't mean all words are empty, only that, for the most part, words have a very flimsy relationship to their literal meaning. I'm thankful for all the love Roman has shown to me, and for never being selfish or self-centered or egocentric or neurotic or unfaithful. For Logan Roy and his family, words are just the thinnest top layer of communication, concealing an ocean of feelings, motives, and other things that can't be said aloud. Sarcasm at Thanksgiving is par for the course, and that's only one of many ways people can mean the opposite of what they say. You want to abandon Honeymoon? No, I mean, no, I don't want to. Do you? No. Huh. I don't want to. No. Do you? I just came to say how sorry I was to hear about your dad. Well, it's so kind of you to do it in person when you could have just called. This undercurrent is something that characters, especially Logan's three children, have learned to be hyper-sensitive to. Sincerity is always suspicious. If it's not sarcasm, it must be disguising a hidden motive. I think you're a super talented superstar, and I love you. Oh, you're such a fucking bitch. It makes sense that Kendall, Roman, and Shiv are so guarded. The biggest presence in their lives, their father, is lying to them all the time, another form of nothing words. When you say the thing that's not, that's a lie. Logan lies with abandon, and as a result, has created an atmosphere of stifling paranoia. Please, I want you to speak freely. Dad, I think it is possible that you have sometimes somewhat chilled the atmosphere of free-flowing debate. Words to him are just tools to gain advantage, and they can be discarded as easily as they're said. Take away this cold utility, and words become meaningless and confusing to him. Have you told the others? The others? The kids. No. Is there an advantage? No, I mean just to, you know, just to tell them. Oh. Yeah. Yeah. Sure. This profoundly cynical outlook is the result of living in a world in which words have only temporary meaning. Promises made today are void tomorrow. Words are here, then gone. It's kind of a superpower, isn't it? If you can lie to someone like that, to their face. I mean, I know you're lying, but I still find you very plausible and appealing. The most extreme form of this is gaslighting, giving words meaning, then violently ripping that meaning away. But the thing about me is that I'm a terrible, terrible prick. I got you again. I just got you. Fuck me, man. Your face. Pals. Yes? Yeah. Would you kiss me? What? Would you? Kiss you? If I asked you to. Come on. I'm joking. I'm joking. In this way, words can be meaningless, while simultaneously having incredible power. They can have no link to the truth, but influence people's actions, the world's actions. If you say them forcefully enough, words can become the truth. Or at least that's what Logan believes, both in his business life and his personal one. We're gonna be the number one media conglomerate in the world. Did I even make contact? Um, I don't... Because that's not something I do. The rest of the characters aren't as shameless and ruthless as Logan is. At times, they seem genuinely scared of the power words can have. Look, I'm saying this, but I don't believe it. I'm just saying it because this is the time for all saying things. And you don't want to hear... No, I don't want to hear anything, Greg, because it was a misunderstanding, okay? Well, I saw what I saw. Shut up! I just said shut up. Shut the fuck up. Alright, but I think you should know what I saw. No, shut the fuck up, Greg. You want to talk to each other normally? Okay. Talk about the big shit? Yeah, let's talk about the big shit. We can talk about our feelings. Ultimately, Logan's willingness to lie and manipulate has done great harm to his children's ability to communicate honestly and to form relationships based on trust, on saying what you mean. It's to the point that when someone does manage to genuinely express themselves, it cuts like a knife. I wonder if the sad I'd be without you would be less than the sad I get from being with you. You know, I was astonished re-watching this show how thoroughly the creators scrutinize language, its power and its content, or lack thereof. I think the attention to this theme actually makes for the unique and uniquely funny cadence the show has, which drew me to look closer in the first place. Succession is about a lot of things, but what it may be interested in above all is fucking words. Fucking words. Hey, everybody. Thank you so much for watching.

According to Warner Brothers, nearly 60% of the people who saw that movie were 17 or younger. Now for a whole generation of us, the Harry Potter series spanned our adolescence and imprinted onto our lives a love of reading. But less has been said about the films. I think their commitment to good cinematic work was potentially just as important for young people's filmic education as J.K. Rowling's accomplishments were for our literary upbringing. For me, that all starts with Alfonso Cuarón and the third film in the series, The Prisoner of Azkaban. Coming at a crucial time in both the books and the films, Azkaban marks Potter's transition from perilous adventure stories for children to increasingly dark, increasingly nuanced treatments of character and plot. Picking Cuarón to handle this passage seems perfect in retrospect as it set the tone for the grimmer and grimier final installments of the series. But Warner Brothers has to be credited for taking a chance on a director whose previous film was an explicit Mexican road trip drama about sexual discovery. A lot of the style of that film in Cuarón's previous work is readily apparent in Azkaban, most notably his fondness for a moving, often hand-held camera. Just take a quick sped up look at this early scene from The Great Hall. Not a single shot is stationary. This gives the scene and the film a feeling of forward momentum and establishes a curious camera. But it also lends to the film a sense of unease, an inability to find stable footing. For a film that is to be haunted by a feared killer throughout, such a style is fitting. And this isn't the only signature technique Cuarón brings to Potter. His famous use of the long take is here as well. This shot right here is a minute and 49 seconds long and as the critic Kristen Thompson has noted, it marks a crucial tonal shift in the film. The first two scenes, one in which Harry blows up his horrible aunt and one in which he takes a ride on the ridiculous night bus are both pretty light-hearted. You could almost say that these two scenes are a nod to the two comparatively lighter films that came before this. In this scene and this shot, Harry learns of the true danger he faces. And what's important to notice here is that with deeper, more significant peril comes deeper, more significant isolation. Mr. Weasley pulls Harry into another part of the leaky cauldron separating him from his friends while keeping the specter of Sirius Black in the foreground. When the conversation turns explicitly to black, his image is placed between them with family and friends framed in the background. Then Mr. Weasley pulls Harry into an alcove so that they are alone, asking Harry not to go looking for black. And finally, for the key dramatic question and period on the scene, Poirron frames Harry completely by himself. Now this is great filmmaking. Isolation will go on to be a key theme in Azkaban and the rest of the series. Despite its constant message of friendship and its focus on the bond between Harry, Ron, and Hermione, the series returns repeatedly to Harry's feelings of being alone, the chosen one, his gradual realization of a burden that he must carry without help. The Prisoner of Azkaban reflects, deepens, and foreshadows these feelings by separating Harry out from his surroundings or else placing him apart from those around him. Poirron never misses a chance to return to this theme, whether it means separating Harry from his friends in a shot about something else, telling Emma Watson to kneel out of a shot, or ending the movie by having Harry literally fly away from a crowd. Internal consistency is one of Poirron's major strengths and is what makes The Prisoner of Azkaban a cut above the rest of the films in the series, some of which are quite good. Motifs shoot back and forth across the runtime like magic spells and comment on each other, tightening a web that laces meaning throughout. Little things like following empty footsteps in the snow before introducing a key object that visualizes people moving through Hogwarts Castle with footsteps. Some immediate foreshadowing there, but what about some longer foreshadowing? Maybe a little bird that flies around the grounds in the beginning of the film to places it will only later occur to us that map the sights of significant scenes in the movie. Or what about something more meaningful, like Poirron's recurring motif of moving the camera through glass, a motif that pays off twice in this scene where the students fight off a boggart, a creature that visualizes your worst fear. Twice in this scene, in two beautiful shots, the camera moves through the mirrors of this wardrobe, suggesting that while it's important to look through windows and see the world, you can also look through mirrors, which is to say, into yourself. Not to mention that these shots just make you think, wait, how did he do that? A great question for any young filmgoer to ask. And that's the point here, isn't it? We hear so much about a film industry that continues to pump out crap films that's ruled by lowest common denominator fare. There are a number of reasons for that, but one of them is that a lot of the movie going public suffers from cinematic illiteracy. We don't know what makes a good film, so the industry serves up superficial projects that play on cheap emotions and make us into passive viewers. But learning film is always an active enterprise. All great movies are teaching movies, because they encourage us to participate with them and with the whole of cinema. This is why The Prisoner of Azkaban is so important. Like anything, it's easy to develop a taste for something when we learn it young. Harry Potter is a mega franchise, one millions of kids bought tickets for and millions more will watch and rewatch at home. Having a great film like this in that roster, the results could be exponential. A small light that, in the end, shines much brighter than anyone would expect. Maximum! Hey everybody, thanks for watching. Obviously I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. I grew up with those books. Those ages at the beginning were actually my ages, so this was a blast to make. I want to thank you guys actually because a lot of people actually pledged a dollar or three dollars after last week's video. And those small pledges really mean so much. Because what matters to me is that if you have the ability to pledge, trying to do so over a long term period. Because the Patreon is really my salary. So knowing when I'm going to get gives me the ability to plan new projects, bigger projects in the future, just makes everything a lot more stable. So I'd rather you do a dollar over a year than five dollars or ten dollars over a couple weeks. So if you can do five dollars over a year, you're amazing and I can't even believe it. But thank you guys for everything you've donated to this channel. It's been amazing. It's helped me grow this thing and it's growing really fast now and it's really exciting. People are watching and paying attention, which is all I ever wanted to start. So thank you again. I will see you guys next Wednesday.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1274\n","\n","Link  214 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/d46Azg3Pm4c\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/d46Azg3Pm4c\n","[youtube] d46Azg3Pm4c: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] d46Azg3Pm4c: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 7.47MiB in 02:32\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  As a filmmaker, Christopher Nolan always wants to walk a fine line. If there's one fundamental theme that suffuses his entire filmography, it's that cinema, as a shared narrative, can be a hugely powerful cultural force. I'm far from the first to notice or mention that many of his films reference film itself. That, for example, the Inception team bears a strong resemblance to a film crew. But interestingly, though a lot of his work could be called meta-cinematic, Nolan is extremely careful about avoiding meta-cinematic images in his work. For example, in the established Batman continuity, Bruce Wayne and his parents are out to see the Mask of Zorro film before the fateful double murder that incites the Dark Knight's whole saga. In Batman Begins, however, Nolan's retelling of that origin, the Waynes are out to the opera Mephistopheles instead. That change is a purposeful one, as Nolan has said in an interview, we didn't have young Bruce Wayne going to see Zorro because a character in a movie watching a movie is very different than a character in a comic book watching a movie. It creates a deconstructionist thing that we were trying to avoid. The reason Nolan tries to avoid this is because over and above everything, his cinema has always been about immersion, bringing you into a story so fully that the edges disappear and you're carried along by the narrative momentum. This is the line that Nolan wants to walk. He wants to be immersive and meta-cinematic at the same time. In other words, he wants to hide in plain sight. Hiding in plain sight is essentially the subject matter of Nolan's fifth film and my favorite, The Prestige. You could almost call this film meta-meta-cinematic in that it functions as a kind of rule book for how to achieve this immersive effect without seeming deconstructionist, to use Nolan's words. Just take the first sequence. The first thing you see is the film title over a mysterious shot of several mislaid top hats in the woods. The text here is of course the title card, but if you know the film, you know that this text also has a literal function because these hats are the prestige of the Prestige itself. The second clue is in their number. Doubles, copies, multiplicity. It's the key to understanding the tricks of this film and this is echoed in the second shot as well with bird cages full of identical canaries. From here, Michael Caine's character goes on to describe how a magic trick works. Every magic trick consists of three parts or acts. The pledge, the turn and finally the Prestige. This sequence carefully sets up the film's own pledges, that is Borden and Angier played by Christian Bale and Hugh Jackman respectively, while illustrating its method through Michael Caine's voiceover and his trick for the little girl. But the film is playing its own tricks here through editing. Where is this voiceover coming from? Usually in film, a voiceover means someone commenting on the events being shown from some time in the future. When the scene ends, it cuts to the courtroom scene of Borden's murder trial, picking up the last phrase as if Michael Caine's whole explanation was testimony. It's not until the very end of the film that we learn that the bird trick with the girl is chronologically the last moment in the film. Nolan reverses the temporal relationship between the voiceover and the scene under it. And this kind of displacement is the key mechanism for the whole movie. The Prestige is all about a trick that moves its object through time and space instantaneously. This is exactly what all film editing does. Most of editing cuts between short distances and continuous times. Indeed with a simple cut, that's what most people expect. But that same simple cut can traverse great distances also and great lengths of time in either direction. Nolan has described learning the power of this by watching Terrence Malick's The Thin Red Line, in which Malick cuts to memories simply, without blurs or fades or wavy lines. The Prestige exploits this power to the extreme, cutting between multiple different nested memories. Nolan sets up this device with Borden and Angier's respective journals. But once these devices are established, he cuts between the narratives at will and without warning. In this way, The Prestige demonstrates a unique capacity of film, without compromising the audience's suspended disbelief. The complex narrative structure is totally subservient to the story Nolan wants to tell. It's necessary to keep its twists secret until the film wants to reveal them. This is Christopher Nolan's great gift as a filmmaker. He's so in tune with the dynamics of film narrative that he can construct a plot with so much forward momentum that even when he gives you all the clues, you remain at his mercy until the very final shot. Now if this was the only lesson of The Prestige, I'd be satisfied in calling it a great film. But there's one scene here, easily missed, that adds a final important point, I think. You can watch The Prestige and enjoy the story for what it is. That's what Nolan wants for us. He wants us to be amazed. And as the film itself says, most of us want to be fooled. But all films, even one as tightly wound as this, invite a probing eye. As the boy sees into the bird trick, we can see into cinema. We're accustomed to taking most editing for granted. But the way stories are told, the tools of any storytelling medium, in large part determine the way we construct our own memories, shared or personal. This is all to say that studying film doesn't kill its magic. It feeds that magic back into the real world.

Is it possible to make the movie Passengers better, with some relatively minor changes? You know, I don't think this is a really bad film. After hearing reviews from friends and online, I sort of expected it to be. But I think that feeling was mostly disappointed expectation. Passengers is by no means a train wreck. It's just really, really predictable. The plot goes like this. After the interstellar spaceship Avalon malfunctions, Chris Pratt wakes up from hypersleep, 90 years before he's supposed to. 90 years before anyone else on the ship. He can't go back to sleep. He can't contact Earth. He can't get to the ship's controls. He tries to do all of these things and fails. As a year passes, he grows increasingly sad and hopeless. So eventually, he decides to wake up another passenger, Jennifer Lawrence, condemning her to the same fate, essentially death, in order to give himself some more company. He acts like it's another malfunction. He doesn't tell her. After a while, they fall in love. She finds out the truth, gets really mad, and then the ship begins to really malfunction. So Pratt sacrifices himself to save it, but in the end, she saves him. They fall in love again and spend the rest of their lives alone on the ship, happily ever after. Oh, and Lawrence Fishburne's in it too. How long have I got? About 12 or 13 minutes in Act 3. But, you know, count your blessings. It's way better than what Oscar-nominated actor Andy Garcia got. So you can break this plot up into five basic turning points. One, Chris wakes up. Two, Chris wakes Jennifer up. Three, she finds out. Four, Chris sacrifices himself. And five, she forgives him. The most acute tension in the film happens between parts two and three, when Jennifer starts to fall in love with Chris, but doesn't yet know the truth. We know the truth is coming. There's a little dramatic irony there, and so we wait with increasing anxiety until it does. And when it does, predictably, Jennifer freaks out, predictably, and we feel a little sadness, predictably. At this point, exactly an hour into the movie, the script has sort of written itself into a corner. Because Pratt is the real main character, because we spend 30 minutes alone with him at the start of the film and see everything through his eyes, there's really only two paths to take regarding the central relationship. Either he dies or she forgives him. In both ways, he finds absolution for the sin he committed, because you're not going to be able to turn him bad. Not a character like this. Not unless you have five seasons to do it. And yes, I know there are some allusions to The Shining here, but The Shining spent pretty much no time at all endearing us to the character of Jack Torrance. Passengers spends the whole first act endearing us to the lovable, scrappy Chris Pratt. It's clear the creators or the studio were intent on this being a love story, so they chose to go with the Schmaltzy ending. But they could have chosen either. The last 45 minutes would have been the same. A movie pretty much devoid of real tension or suspense, which requires a completely new plot device in the third act, the total malfunction of the ship, to juice the ending with some adrenaline. You know, a couple weeks ago, I was watching Chris Stuckman and Doug Walker's joint review of Passengers, and Walker said something interesting. If they told this in a different order, wouldn't have been ten times more interesting. Yes. The thing I began to wonder is, what if you rearranged the movie so that Jennifer Lawrence was the point of view character, not Chris Pratt? What if the film began with her experience? Well, I couldn't stop thinking about it, so I re-edited the existing footage to see what would happen to the story. Good morning, Aurora. How are you feeling? You just spent 120 years in suspended animation. Ground concourse. Hello? Anybody? Hello. Hi. Are you Passenger or crew? Passenger. Jim Preston. Do you know what's going on? Nobody else from my row woke up. Same for me. When I made this change and just watched from there, some interesting things started to happen. First of all, the first act changes its tone entirely. With the original first act, you're wandering around the ship with Chris Pratt. You learn cool things, you see him come to terms with the situation, have fun, get depressed, and finally reach the ethical dilemma that's meant to animate the movie. What you see is what you get here, which makes for a somewhat passive viewing experience. It's an amusing sequence, but that's mostly down to cool production design and Pratt's always charming performance. Guess I am gonna die of old age on this ship. But in the new first act, the story is infused from the start with mystery. When I made the editing changes, I was genuinely surprised by just how creepy Pratt's character is when you take away his point of view. We don't know whether to trust him or not, believe him or not, and that makes the audience's experience an active one in every moment. Do you know what's going on? Nobody else from my row woke up. Same for me. As he leads Jennifer around the ship, locations become crime scenes where the viewer tries to figure out what's happening. This, of course, by the way, is what makes Andrei Tarkovsky's Solaris so great. So much has happened on Solaris by the time the lead character arrives that he and the audience have to piece the fragments together themselves. I mean, just look at how creepy he is. I actually think that Pratt's performance takes on more dimensions from this angle. You're not always forced to see him as sympathetic, so his darker side comes out in greater relief. More important than that, the dark choice that sits at the heart of this film hits with greater impact when seen from the first time from Lawrence's perspective, because we feel the cruelty as she feels it. Did you wake me up? I tried not to. So now we're at the point where the original story hits that dead end. But with this new edit, you have some more options to play with. Namely, with this configuration, you could actually turn Pratt into the villain the original film suggests but can't follow through on, and make passengers into the thriller horror film that so many critics wanted to see. You could even cut back in that whole first section of Chris's time alone on the ship, but put it after the revelation. Without the need to justify his good-guiness, you could show a deeper, more desperate side to his loneliness. Something that I think actually would make him more sympathetic in the end, and the choice he makes more agonizing. Of course, this simple cut and paste doesn't solve every problem in the script. The ending, for example, is still an issue. I think you'd want to remove the malfunction McGuffin, but it might be just as trite to close the story in true horror fashion. It could be cool to give it a Twilight Zone ending, as Peter Screda at SlashFilm suggested, and have Pratt die and Lawrence get so lonely that she begins to contemplate the same horrible choice. Brainstorming like this is obviously really fun, and much easier than actually writing a movie and making one. For all its faults, Passengers is a big-budget movie with a completely original script, and that should be celebrated because it's a dying breed. But a film like this is a good opportunity for would-be screenwriters to think about story, because you can learn just as much from films that don't work, as you can from those that do.

It's hard to think back on that period now to a time before Michael Jackson became Michael Jackson, a world famous megastar whose work is so ubiquitous it's less like music and more like the air we breathe. But 1979 was before all that. It was before Thriller and Beat It and Billie Jean and Smooth Criminal. It was four years before the world first saw Jackson do the moonwalk on Motown 25. And critically for him at the time, it was ten years after I Want You Back and the hits of the Jackson 5. In the intervening years, as Michael entered adolescence and outgrew the cute little boy that the world wanted him to be forever, he released four solo albums that tried to bridge the gap from his Motown roots to whatever was supposed to come next. The last of those, Forever Michael, failed to crack the top half of the Billboard 200. In the late 70s, Jackson's pop domination was far from a foregone conclusion, but behind the scenes, he was paying attention to the changing trends in music. And in the mid to late 70s, there was one trend that was growing faster than any other. In 1977, the disco subculture was juiced by an unlikely hit film, Saturday Night Fever. Of course, disco had been around for almost ten years by then, growing out of soul and funk music and out of black, latino, and LGBT cultures. Though you wouldn't know it watching John Travolta dance to the Bee Gees for an all-white crowd. But a year later, Jackson and his brothers had a disco hit with Shake Your Body Down to the Ground, and at that point, the stage was set for what would become Michael's re-arrival as a show-stopping solo artist. In August 79, Jackson released Off the Wall, the first of three partnerships with producer Quincy Jones. The first single off that album was Don't Stop Till You Get Enough, a song that Jackson wrote himself and co-produced, and his first number one in seven years. The song was a worldwide smash, one that still has legs 40 years later. I think it's been played at every wedding I've ever been to. For Jackson, it was the crossover hit that helped him turn a corner in his career. It was number one on the soul charts, but more importantly, it was a pop hit. It was inspired by disco and funk, but it was more than that. When we listen to the song now, it doesn't carry the historical baggage of disco. As music professor Ann Danielson says, in the popular imagination, Don't Stop is pure dance music. There are reasons for this beyond Jackson's undeniable charisma as a performer. That certainly plays a big part. But if you look closer at the musical DNA of Don't Stop, you can see why the song has such appeal. The first place to look is the rhythm, grounded by bass drum and bass guitar and richly layered with snare drum, shakers, guitar, and Jackson banging on a glass soda bottle. This is the part of the song that makes you want to dance. As Danielson notes, the rhythm is taking a lot of its cues from funk music, which emphasize the first beat in every measure of four, something that was made famous by James Brown. This emphasis is one thing that makes the song more danceable. Another is syncopation, or something that disturbs the regular flow of the beat. Syncopation creates tension in music that you want to resolve with your body. In the case of funk, that syncopation can be very complex and very noticeable. But in Don't Stop till you get enough, Jackson minimizes the distance between the beat and its syncopated sound, which comes only a handful of milliseconds before. Danielson calls this micro rhythm. The beat still has funk, but it registers subconsciously, resulting in a cleaner feeling sound, something that attracts a mainstream pop audience. A cleaner sound is also a feature of disco, and Don't Stop's rhythm is incorporating those elements as well. The shaker, for example, is sounding consistently every sixteenth note, and the main pulse, though emphasizing the first beat in every measure, is designed to combine the bass guitar and the bass drum to create the same sound every time, as opposed to funk or rock, where you can mostly hear the difference between instruments. On top of this undercurrent of rhythm, which is balancing the features of funk and disco, Jackson spreads a tapestry of sounds that fill in the gaps between beats and help to smooth everything out, strings and horns and electric piano, again reaching for that clean surface that defines the pop sensibility. The icing on the cake is the harmony and Jackson's falsetto. As Ethan Hine points out over at his blog, the song only has two chords, A and B, which alternate back and forth to create a trance-like modal groove, something more associated with eastern music than western. And above this Jackson sings a melody marked by the first two notes in the first two syllables in every line. These notes are D sharp and A, and the interval between them is what's called a tritone. As Hine says, the relationship between these notes is somewhat off-kilter and your mind notices that, and that infuses the song with an urgency that it wouldn't otherwise have. As I said before, Jackson's charisma here is unmistakable. This is where the world was introduced to the grunts and ticks that would become a signature of his style. Don't Stop is effectively the birth of a new artist, one who would take over the world in the decade to come. And this song goes a long way to explaining how and why that happened. You can see Jackson and Jones taking the syncopation of funk, the pulse of disco, the vibe of eastern music, even the structure of a rock song with its verse-chorus-verse-chorus pattern, complete with a euphoric bridge by Greg Villain-Gaines. Jackson recalibrates all these elements toward the end of pure pop music and electrifies them with the power of his voice. The song is greater than the sum of its parts. It's something new and exciting. It's the sound of Michael Jackson. Do you ever want to stop? No. Don't stop until you get enough. And you haven't had enough. No way. No way. Hey everybody.

If you haven't heard, I wrote a book of essays that'll be out this spring, and you can pre-order it with the links in the description below. As we say goodbye to the holidays and move into January, we also say goodbye to the festive and charming part of the winter season. Now comes the grim, punishing, bitter months of winter, the endless months when all that enchanting snow turns to icy sludge. What we need now, as always, is an artist who understands us. And for this time of year, there's no better artist than Caspar David Friedrich. Friedrich was a German painter of the early 1800s with a very serious-looking face. He's associated with German romanticism, a rising intellectual and artistic movement of the period that sought to reconnect humanity with feeling and spirituality. The painters of that period found that connection in nature, and so landscape painting became a genre of special significance. Friedrich's landscapes represent the pinnacle of this movement. Working for most of his life from Dresden, he focused largely on the austere, beautiful, often wintry environment of northern Germany, with its fir and oak trees, morning mists, harbors and shorelines along the Baltic coast, and the rugged terrain of the Harz Mountains. His paintings don't always depict real places, though. Often he took elements from various sites and fused them together into an invented composition he saw in his mind's eye. That might be what gives his work such power. Friedrich's landscapes are realistically rendered, but the landscape is not the subject of these canvases. The subject is the feeling he has in the presence of the landscape, the staggering encounter with the divinity he sees in it. This is the essence of the sublime. In the German philosophical tradition, the sublime is a power or force or beauty that is so great it exceeds our ability to comprehend it, and we stand before its immensity in awe and terror. The sublime was a critically important idea in the period after the Enlightenment, when secularism was threatening the core of Christianity. As artist Anoka Faruki points out, citing Thomas McEveley, the Romantics could replace the Enlightenment's discredited Christianity with the sublime. And once again, they found the sublime in nature, or rather they found it in themselves. For Immanuel Kant, great German philosopher and theorist of the sublime, this immensity escapes our power of judgment. But the fact that we're able to experience it at all means that it does correspond to something in us, a sublimity discoverable in the mind. In his landscapes, Friedrich is trying to paint that moment when the sublime in nature stirs the sublime in us, which is why he made such revolutionary use of the Rückenfigure, or the figure seen from behind, like this one in his most famous painting, Wanderer Above the Sea of Fog. You're encouraged to put yourself in the shoes of this person, gazing across the misty mountaintops into the infinite sublime. But as far as Friedrich's Rückenfigures go, this one is actually a bit of an anomaly. For the most part, Friedrich's human figures are tiny compared to the landscape they're contemplating, and that augmented the vastness of the terrain. The human body is our most natural anchor to determine the scale of things, and it's also what we're inescapably drawn to in any image. So there's no better way to simulate a sense of bigness than by featuring miniature people. As an aside, this is a technique that Denis Villeneuve used to great effect in his Dune movie from earlier this year. What's singular about Friedrich's landscapes is the environments he chooses to elicit the sublime. You might expect sun-dappled, colorful, blue-skied, pastoral images, but much more often than not, Friedrich's landscapes are ominous and nebulous, dominated by rolling mists and fogs that obscure objects in the distance. The trees are barren, their branches contorted like sharp fingers, and once-great Gothic cathedrals are reduced to ruins in the snow. It's in these landscapes that Friedrich gives us nature at its most intimidating, and therefore at its most sublime. After all, the sublime, like I said before, includes a feeling of terror. The terror of being in the presence of something far more vast than ourselves, of being at the mercy of what we can't wrap our arms or our minds around. Pastoral landscapes, in their idealized beauty, imply man's control, his dominion over nature. In Friedrich's stark landscapes, man, so small against the world, is not in control at all. This is why Friedrich is the perfect artist for winter. This is why so many of his canvases are set in these grim, punishing, bitter months. He shows us the value of being humbled by nature, and winter is the most humbling season. Of course, for the last two years, nature has humbled us plenty. More than just the winter has been grim. So maybe Friedrich is a painter not only for this season, but for our times, as we stand on the shore of the moment, weary, not quite as big as we imagined we were, peering into the fog ahead.

But Jimmy, the problem, I mean, I'm for it, but look, we have people coming into our country that are looking to do tremendous harm. You look at the two, look at Paris, look at what happened in Paris. I mean, these people, they did not come from Sweden, okay? Look at what happened in Paris. Look at what happened last week in California with, you know, 14 people dead, other people going to die. They're so badly injured. I mean, we have a real problem. There's a tremendous hatred out there. And what I want to do is find out what it, you know, you can't solve a problem until you find out what's the root cause. And I want to find out what is the problem, what's going on. And it's temporary. I've had so many people call me and say thank you. Now, if you remember when I did that a week ago, it was like Bedlam. All of a sudden, and you watch last night and you see people talking, they're saying, well, Trump has a point. We have to get down to the problem. The people that are friends of mine, they call, they said, Donald, you've done us a tremendous service because we do have a problem and we have to find out what is the— Those may have been crank calls. Those may have been crank calls. One of the things I find fascinating about Donald Trump is the way he uses language differently than other candidates for political office, especially president of the United States. Whereas his opponents and the political class in general seem hyper aware that their words will be picked apart and used against them, Trump willfully disregards this fact. As a lifelong salesman, he has a huckster's knack for selling a feeling, even if the ideas and facts that underscore it are spurious, racist or just plain incomprehensible. So I thought it would be illuminating to look at a Trump answer to a simple question. In this case, Jimmy Kimmel asking Trump whether or not it's wrong to discriminate against people based on their religion, referring to Trump's proposal to temporarily ban all Muslims from entering the United States. This 220 word, exactly one minute answer, displays, I think, a range of the things that Trump uses all the time in his speech. The first thing to note is how simple this language is. Of the 220 words, 172 or 78% are only one syllable, and often they come in a rhythmic series like a volley of jabs ending with one of his buzzwords. We have to get down to the problem. 39 words or 17% are two syllables long. Only four words have three syllables, three of which are the word Tremendous. Tremendous. Tremendous. And just two words are four syllables long. California, which he's forced to use because it has less syllables than San Bernardino, and temporary, which he swallows. And it's temporary. I've had so many people. This breakdown fits with a study done by the Boston Globe that put all 2016 presidential candidates' announcement speeches through the Flesh-King-Cade readability test to determine their respective grade level rankings. Donald Trump's speech came out at a fourth grade reading level. For reference, Ben Carson came out at sixth grade. Hillary Clinton and Jeb Bush were speaking at an eighth grade reading level. And Bernie Sanders was way up in high school, a sophomore, to be exact. Now, this isn't only down to word or syllable choice. It's about sentence construction, too. Trump favors simple sentences like... We have a real problem. There's a tremendous hatred out there. Rarely does he use complex sentences or independent clauses. He also favors the second person a lot of the time, addressing listeners directly with commands. Look at Paris. Look at what happened in Paris. Look at what happened in Paris. Look at what happened last week in California. Or implicating us in what he's saying as if we've already agreed. And you watch last night and you see people talking. He's really good at this, at framing negative response as an overreaction that was subsequently realized as such. If you remember, when I did that a week ago, it was like Bedlam. All of a sudden, and you watch last night and you see people talking, they're saying, well, Trump has a point. We have to get down to the problem. Maybe the most important technique Trump utilizes, and he does this more than anyone I've ever heard, is ending his sentences with strong, punchy words. A lot of times, he'll rearrange the beginning of a sentence awkwardly so that he can end strong. For example, here, it would probably be more natural to say, you can't solve a problem until you find out what the root cause is. But he brings the is forward to end on root cause. He does the same here. And it looks like that's what he was about to do at the end before Kim will cut him off. These final words are crucial for Trump. They're pointed and taken together sketch the theme of the entire answer. Arm. Dead. Die. Badly injured. Problem. Root cause. Thank you. Bedlam. Point. Problem. Service. Problem. In some sense, it's these words that audiences remember, especially when the rest of his speech is incoherent. Like the best salesman, Trump keeps it simple. He repeats a lot. We have a real problem. What is the problem? We do have a problem. We have to get down to the problem. And he uses his favorite words over and over. Tremendous. Tremendous. Tremendous. Tremendous. Service. And he always seems to have friends who are part of the group that he's currently insulting, calling him up and thanking him for the privilege. Many of them called me and they said, you know, Donald, you're right. We have a problem. I mean, look, there is a problem. Donald Trump knows when to sound incredulous or forceful. He has good comedic instinct. You could even call him witty, but you can't call him smart or well informed. The best salesman could sell you a TV without knowing anything about it, because the TV isn't what matters. What matters is you. And if you are an American citizen who for years has listened to politicians sound sophisticated while accomplishing nothing, you might just be primed for something that is everything they are not. But the next time you feel like Donald Trump has a point, do yourself a favor and look at his words. Hey, everybody. Thanks for watching.

It's the theory that the language you speak determines how you think. Yeah, it affects how you see everything. The point being that there is no thought without expression, no content without form, that an idea, however profound it feels to you, does not really exist until you can write it down, or in some cases, put it on film. To watch Denis Villeneuve's Arrival is to watch a filmmaker in command of the language his ideas presuppose, which is to say that he has a firm grasp on craft. I can't really tell you how soothing this is for me as a filmgoer, to feel that I'm in the hands of someone who knows why the film is constructed the way it is. So much of today's filmmaking is all over the place, to the point where the viewer has to exert themselves more to compensate for a lack of focus. In this way, I think Arrival is the perfect response to the bad movies we see so much of. Pretty much everything they do wrong, Arrival does right. It is effective and impactful, and it does this by focusing on the very thing that affects and impacts us, language. But I think Arrival is just as concerned with the language of film as it is with written or spoken or alien language. For example, the first couple scenes are kind of like an enlarged experiment in the Kuleshov effect, the phenomenon in which a viewer derives meaning from two sequential shots that Hitchcock famously illustrated by turning a kindly gentleman into a pervert by replacing a single reverse shot. Villeneuve does the same thing in Arrival, but on the scene level. The first scene is a montage of the birth and young death of Amy Adams' daughter. The second scene is Adams coming to teach at her school on the day of the alien's arrival. Because of the tragedy we witness in the first scene and our assumption that the film's timeline is linear, we read Adams' disinterest here as despondency and her general dry demeanor as one of deep sadness and heartache. It's not until we finish the film and learn that the opening montage happens after the events of the movie that we understand Adams in the second scene was merely a blank canvas that we attached meaning to. Montage means the assembly of pieces of film, which moved in rapid succession before the eye create an idea. What separates Villeneuve from many other filmmakers is his ability to generate ideas with cinematic craft, then on another level mingle those ideas, collide and blend them to create a higher order of meaning. So what's the meaning, for example, that Villeneuve suggests with this Kuleshov effect experiment? Perhaps that the future can influence the past. That's certainly a reasonable thing to derive from this kind of experience in the film. In fact, it's an idea that turns out to be the key to the climax of arrival as Adams learns that the aliens are higher dimensional beings that can see all of time at once and uses that skill to access future events to influence her present. I called you, didn't I? Yes, you did. But you could also read another meaning from the same experience, namely that communication is limited by perspective. From our perspective at the beginning of the film, everything tells us that Adams is grieving. Only later do we learn that that wasn't true. This too is a major theme of arrival. The limits of human communication are reinforced and expanded upon in probe throughout the film. The limits of our biology, of relying on what our senses report, the limits imposed on us by our culture or our own personalities. Trust me, you can understand communication and still end up single. In conversation with the aliens, communication is literally imagined as a screen, a mediator that blurs intention. Now, screens can connect us. They can also divide us. And it's the same with communication. Communication is a link between two parties, but it's a link that often facilitates a split. Language is the foundation of civilization. It's the glue that holds the people together. It's the first weapon drawn in a conflict. We are falling asleep at the wheel, people. You know what I'm talking about. I know you do. What's important here is not that both these readings are valid. They are, but that both have echoes elsewhere in the film and echo off each other. A theme once introduced isn't wasted. The alien language is circular, so the film is too. The difficulty of cooperation in the small group at the Montana site echoes the difficulty of cooperation between nations. Louise's understanding of her displacement in time happens simultaneously with the audience's realization that the events depicted aren't linear. Non-zero sum game. Every theme is filtered through other moments and characters and eventually other themes until it starts to feel like something solid. You start to think, what is the relationship between language and time? Maybe it's that the mind is not a thing but a process. Language happening in time, just like film is communication occurring in time. None of the arts can record time except for cinema. What is a film? It's a mosaic of time. So much of Arrival seems to be about the possibility of meaning in film. What is it? Where does it come from? I think Villeneuve imagines it as an alien spacecraft, mysterious, obscure, an expression that's not quite written or spoken language and so always difficult to decipher. It's something when born out of craft and character and story is always hovering over the film. It's always in the background, seen from different angles, impossible to avoid. Arrival isn't just a repudiation of bad movies because it leads by example. It's also, I think, an active exploration into what makes a movie great. It explores the kind of unique perspective that a film can gift to the film-goer like a language gifted by aliens and what kind of brand new world that perspective allows us to see.

I've always thought of him in a sort of aromatic way, because his paintings evoke the same kind of feelings and memories in me that I get from the sense of smell, as if he was channeling directly into my limbic system, excavating moments that were stored deeply away. A stubborn realist throughout the many changing and often abstract currents of modern art in the early and mid-20th century, his canvases are clean, smooth, and almost too real. Not real like his contemporary Andrew Wyeth, for example, who strived for detail and photorealism, but pulled back by one degree into depictions slightly more generalized, slightly more detached from place, history, and person. In this way, there's just enough room to put your own life into Hopper's work. But once inside, it's impossible not to be closed in and see that life along his themes. Nearly all those themes are present in Nighthawks, unquestionably the artist's most famous work. Themes of loneliness, alienation, voyeurism, quiet contemplation, and more. The scene depicts four people in a New York City diner at night. It's meant to be somewhere in Greenwich Village where Hopper lived, but decades of exhaustive searching have concluded that it was never a real place. There is one waiter and three patrons whose relationships are all ambiguous. Seated so close together in an empty diner at night, it's likely that these two know each other somehow, but though their hands overlap, they don't touch, and their indifferent faces suggest that they could be strangers, if not just momentarily estranged. The main character of the piece seems to be the diner itself, an island of light in the outer darkness. Its diagonal lines are strong, accentuated by the counter and the stools. And we're seeing the diner at an odd angle, as if from the vantage of someone crossing the street. Its triangular corner juts into the frame like the prow of a boat. And this is no coincidence. Not only was Hopper obsessed with the imagery of boats, but he repeatedly situated his buildings at angles like this. And the point of that, I think, was to achieve an effect in which his subjects were both behind and in front of windows. Of course, windows are the place where the separation between outside and inside becomes complicated. And not because we can physically move through them, but because our sight does. Because our gaze invades these private worlds. Indeed, in Hopper's work, the windows often appear as if they're not even there. As opposed to someone like Norman Rockwell, who had a talent for giving glass a texture, Hopper's windows vanish. They invite that voyeuristic look, knowing that houses, like people, can be penetrated with a gaze. Hopper was a very slow, very deliberate painter. He took months to finish a canvas and made several sketches and studies before embarking on the final piece. In these sketches for Nighthawks, we can see Hopper out on the street, looking for the right back angle for this man, modifying to find the perfect effect. Here's his sketches of Josephine, his wife, who modeled for the woman in the painting. Here's her right hand holding a cigarette, which he eventually transplanted to her partner. Hopper wanted his devotion to each work to be mirrored by our appreciation. As slowly and deliberately as he painted, he wanted us to look, really look, to be made vulnerable, as a viewer always is. Whether he or she is crouching in the dark in the building opposite, or simply crossing the street. There's no door to the diner in Nighthawks, no way in except by way of sight. That sight enters the fluorescent light of the establishment, passes through the three patrons in their ennui and loneliness, and exits into the dark, forbidding night behind them. You know, I wonder about that darkness. Hopper tried very hard to unmoor his work from the historical moment. He didn't want only to be judged in the context of his time and place. But it's worth noting that this painting was completed in the weeks and days following the bombing of Pearl Harbor, when everyone in New York City was paranoid about another attack. The city held blackout drills, a way to practice hiding the city in darkness if an aerial assault ever came. But Hopper didn't care. His studio light stayed on. As his wife wrote in her diary, Ed refuses to take any interest in the very likely prospect of being bombed. This was the atmosphere in which Nighthawks was born. Did it have an influence on the painting? I don't know. The future was very uncertain at this moment in time, as uncertain as the darkness that frames the patrons of this diner, a darkness they're launched into by Hopper's composition and our gaze. The artist was obsessed with light, how it fell on houses, on people, through windows, the colors it made. Hopper seemed to disregard the chaos in the world around him. But is it a coincidence that, like his studio, the light of the Nighthawks diner seems to be the last light still shining in the city? For this reason, I think you can find a slightly more optimistic reading of this painting. What is there to do in the face of great disquiet and doubt, but work and live on? All of Hopper's people seem to be huddled up against the present moment. Lonely, yes. Waiting, maybe a little bored. People of Nighthawks are no different. But boredom is exactly when we feel time and being the most acutely. It can inspire a profound mood. Maybe that's what these people are feeling. Alone together in their lighted ship, sailing against the darkness of all that was yet to come. The yellowish-greenish fluorescent light in this scene, like the light in Hopper's studio, is a meager substitute for the brilliance of the sun. But it can, through giant windows, still illuminate the world. Hey everybody, thanks for watching. Nighthawks is one of my favorite paintings ever, so that was just a lot of fun to make. So two big announcements. One, we are about to hit 100,000 subscribers on the Nerdwriter channel. It might be at 100,000 by the time this video goes out. I don't know what to say. That's amazing. I've been doing this for over four years, and it's been amazing and fun and exciting and fascinating from the very start. So thank you to everyone who's been with me from the beginning, who's come on recently, and everything in between. The Nerdwriter is, it's my profession, it's my career, and it's everything that I want to do. So there's going to be a lot more of it. The other big news is that we crossed $1,000 on the Patreon this week, and I just have to thank you so much for that. We're right at the beginning now of what's making this financially feasible for me, so thank you for pledging on Patreon to the Nerdwriter. If you haven't already, I'd love for you to pledge to this project and help me keep making these videos because there is so much more stuff that I want to do, more painting analysis and film analysis and understanding art, but a lot of other cool stuff too that will be coming your way soon. So thank you again, and I will see you guys next Wednesday.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1255\n","\n","Link  221 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/Q1irNBh2qg8\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q1irNBh2qg8\n","[youtube] Q1irNBh2qg8: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] Q1irNBh2qg8: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 6.64MiB in 01:28\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  When should you start the story of this painting? Here, in 1910? Or here, in 1844? Maybe here, in Cezanne Studio at the close of the 19th century? Or maybe the only place you can really find the genesis of this canvas is in Jackson Pollock's mind the day he began to drip. I'm drawn to ask these questions because this painting, 1, No. 13, 1950, is the only abstract work of art that has ever floored me in person. As soon as my eyes caught it, it made me feel something. I don't know that I could describe the feeling, but I didn't have to go searching for it either, a problem I often have with non-figurative paintings where I'm standing in front of a canvas trying to figure out the reaction I'm having to it, feeling guilty because nothing's coming. I don't think the power of this Pollock depends on its place in the history of art, its style, its use of color, its hyperactivity, our intrinsic qualities. But I do think the history of art has a lot to say through Pollock's drip paintings, which he'd been making by this point for about four years. In many ways, they're the culmination of something that has a foggy beginning about a century or two before, with the gradual end of church and noble patronage of the arts and the dawn of painters painting what was important to them. There's no fixed point where you could mark the beginning of modern art. Some find it in this painting by Manet from 1863 with its flattened image and scandalous subject that flouted the values of the Paris Salon. And I think it's as good a moment as any. That year fully two-thirds of submissions to the Salon were rejected and after a public outcry, Emperor Napoleon III authorized a second salon to feature them called, appropriately, the Exhibition of Rejects. It was a massively popular event and though these paintings were criticized as much as they were praised, it marked a moment of legitimacy for art that stood outside the Academy's hierarchy of quality. Once the cat was out of the bag, things started moving very quickly. Less than ten years later, Claude Monet and his compatriots launched into Impressionism, concerning themselves not with the objects they see in the world but how the light plays off them. Impressionism, in turn, starts a chain reaction of, well, reaction. The post-Impressionists begin to dispense with the effects of light and the reality of color and paint according to subjective experience and emotional vision. Then the Fauvists take the arbitrariness of color to kaleidoscopic extremes in the first decade of the 20th century. I mean, just look at the transformation that's happened to painting in just 40 short years. Art has unraveled. Its centuries-long aim of reproducing the physical world in perspective, color, and form is rapidly being abandoned. Vasily Kandinsky, influenced by the Impressionists, by the Fauvists, by music, and by the geometric spirituality of Theosophy, starts pulling away from representation entirely. In a groundbreaking book, he writes, The more abstract is form, the more clear and direct its appeal. And in 1910, he paints this, in which no objects from our world can be recognized at all. It's the first fully abstract painting. Except it turns out that Hilma Off-Klint was actually painting abstracts at least three years prior to this, but no one knew that until many years later. Meanwhile, Pablo Picasso and Georges Braque were shaking up painting in their own way by formalizing Cezanne's experiments with multiple perspectives into Cubism. The Cubists use geometry to show reality from many angles simultaneously. Kandinsky takes inspiration from this, but is more interested in abstracting geometry from its representational source. The sparks that fly from these investigations create several other movements. Futurism in Italy, De Stijl in the Netherlands, Suprematism, then Constructivism in Russia, Dada in Switzerland, and eventually Surrealism in the 1920s and 1930s. A key aspect of the Surrealist Manifesto is the focus on automatic creation, writing or speaking without forethought as a way to access the unconscious mind. Painters like Andre Masson applied this to the visual arts, letting ink run free across paper, creating fluid dream-like drawings prefiguring the work of Jackson Pollock. As World War II ravaged Europe, several of the Surrealists and other European artists escaped to New York City and began to mix with a new school of American painters. The Americans synthesized and reacted to all the various European styles. The abstract expressionists, as they were called, made work that was deeply personal, formally inventive, and confrontational. Exiled Surrealist Wolfgang Palin put it best, paintings no longer represent. Today it has become the role of the painting to look at the spectator and ask him, what do you represent? Polic strip paintings push abstraction to its furthest limit. Even in Kandinsky, lines still bound recognizable shapes. In Pollock, there are no shapes, no suggestions to grab onto. The line itself, dancing across the canvas, is set free, containing nothing, separating nothing. There is no inside, no outside, nowhere for your eyes to rest. All that remains is energy, wild emotional energy that peers into you, not the other way around. I think that's why I reacted so strongly to this painting in person. I could feel it looking at me. You know, like I said before, these drip paintings have intrinsic value. But I also think they speak to something deep in human nature, that we are obsessive. In the same way that we won't stop until we're flying among the stars, it took less than a hundred years for this to become this. A fast changing world contributed hugely, of course. But beyond that, I do believe there's a drive in us to take things as far as they can go. And the century of modern art is an exhilarating example of that. It's just inspiring how irrepressible human creativity can be.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1001\n","\n","Link  222 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/j4CJ7h3mX4Q\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/j4CJ7h3mX4Q\n","[youtube] j4CJ7h3mX4Q: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] j4CJ7h3mX4Q: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 11.64MiB in 03:16\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  A sudden blow, the great wings beating still above the staggering girl, her thighs caressed by the dark webs, her nape caught in his bill, he holds her helpless breast upon his breast. How can those terrified, vague fingers push the feathered glory from her loosening thighs? And how can body, laid in that white rush, but feel the strange heart beating where it lies? A shudder in the loins engenders there the broken wall, the burning roof and tower, and Agamemnon dead. Being so caught up, so mastered by the brute blood of the air, did she put on his knowledge with his power before the indifferent beak could let her drop? Laeda and the Swan is a son that William Butler Yeats wrote and rewrote many times, but finally appeared in this form in his renowned collection called The Tower, published in 1928 when he was 63. The Tower was the first book of poems he released after becoming a Nobel laureate five years prior. Yeats is of that exceptionally rare breed of artist who improved in quality as he entered his late life. The poem takes its subject from Greek mythology, the story of Zeus assuming the form of a swan to seduce Laeda, wife of the Spartan king Tindarius, who bore from this union Helen of Troy, whose infidelity ignited the Trojan War and the beginning of classical history. Before we explore the way Yeats used this subject to create meaning, just take a quick look at the actual shape of the poem. There's something unsettling about it. The form of the sonnet appears to be hijacked everywhere, it's twisted and torn apart. Like Dr. Frankenstein, Yeats has surgically attached the Shakespearean sonnet with its first two quatrains featuring an ABAB rhyme scheme, with the Petrarchan sonnet in the last six lines and an EFGEFG rhyme scheme, including the unnerving slant rhyme Up and Drop, which robs the final moment of any auditory closure. Most notable of all, though, is line 11, which appears to be slashed and split in two, leaving the final three lines just dangling there, like Laeda herself, in the indifferent beak of the swan. In this way, Yeats commits a kind of violence on the sonnet form. Not for nothing, the poet is attempting to augment the violent content of his work. Sonnets, at least Shakespearean sonnets, are traditionally about great love, and yet here Yeats uses the form to describe what could be considered the exact opposite, an act of violent rape. And if you look at successive versions of Laeda and the Swan, you can see that Yeats turned up the volume on this violence. For example, in one version, the poem begins, A rush, a sudden wheel, and hovering still, The bird descends, her frail thighs pressed by the webbed toes, And that all-powerful Bill has laid her helpless face upon his breast. The early version almost assumes Laeda's acquiescence to the gods' advances. In the later version, beginning with the shock of a sudden blow, Zeus' molestation is intensely emphasized, and emphasized, too, is Laeda and the reader's disorientation, the great wings beating still, the ambiguity of beating still, how can wings be still if they're beating? And on the other hand, if he means that they're still beating, that means, terrifyingly, that the rape has already begun while the Swan is still in the air. Now in this version, the girl is staggering, her thighs caressed, a word that disturbs us by commingling the erotic with the vicious, something that Yeats does a bunch in this poem. Caressed by the dark webs, that gives a sense of just how big the bird is because not even the toes but the webs between the toes are what's caressing her. And it should be noted that both the first and second line end with enjambments pulling us awkwardly through the verse. And it's not until the last line of that verse that we finally get the subject he, as if everything was happening so fast that Laeda couldn't find her bearings until the gruesome act was already underway. The first quatrain of Laeda and the Swan is disturbing in the extreme, setting the scene from Laeda's horrified point of view. Then we have the second quatrain, which is made up of two rhetorical questions. Both seem to ask the same thing. What could Laeda do? Against the awesome power of a god, how could she possibly resist? How can she do anything but feel the strange heart beating where it lies? These questions can be read in two ways. You can read them rhetorically, which is to say, read them as saying, obviously she can't do anything and such is the tragedy of the poem. But I think Yeats invites us to read them literally as well, which is to say, what can she do? More on that in a moment. After the first two verses comes the volta, a term for when a sonnet turns and the questions or events posed in the first lines are answered. In this case, after the shutter, referring both to the moment of ejaculation and Laeda's fear, we have the poet examining the consequences of the rape. And they are really far-reaching. The broken wall, the burning roof and tower all intimate that the rape of Laeda not only caused but ensured the eventual destruction of Troy and the rise of Greece and Western history, a history that was born out of rape, war and murder. And Agamemnon dead. Here we have Yeats' own alteration to the mythological history. As the story goes, Laeda laid two eggs. One bore Helen and Pollux, demigods and children of Zeus, and the other bore Castor and Clytemnestra, children of Laeda's mortal husband, Tindarius, who she laid with the same night. By citing the death of Agamemnon, famously killed by his wife, Clytemnestra, as among the faded ramifications of the rape, Yeats demonstrates the full effect of the trauma. And by doing this, he reaches into the history of art as well, because the calls to Troy and Agamemnon's death bring to mind, respectively, Homer's Iliad, the pinnacle of the epic form, and Aeschylus' play, the Orestia, the first great work of Western drama. All this is done in 11 words. Without even mentioning the continued sexual overtones. And then Yeats concludes the poem with one final question. Did she put on his knowledge with his power before the indifferent beak could let her drop? And to understand this, and the poem itself in its larger context, we have to know a little bit more about Yeats and his way of thinking. From his early life, Yeats had always been drawn to mysticism, to astrology, and to the occult. In middle age, he developed his own complex metaphysical and cosmic system, which he laid out in extreme detail in a book called A Vision. One of the key ideas was that history was made up into gyres, or cycles of about 2,000 years, alternating between ages of spirituality and ages of secularism. Each cycle reached the peak of its excellence in the exact middle, then decayed slowly until it was finally replaced by the new one. This idea was explored most potently in his famous poem, The Second Coming. Yeats identified his own time, our time, as the end of the religious cycle of Christianity, and envisioned the start of a new, unknown cycle of secularism initiated by the coming of a great beast. The last time such a cycle began is the subject of Leta and the Swan. The Rape of Leta by Zeus signals the start of the Classical Era, around 2000 BC. In each case, the divine visits the earth and leaves the seeds of the history that is to come. This is the key to Yeats' question. Did she put on his knowledge with his power? Did Leta glimpse the future she was creating, the cycle she was inaugurating before the indifferent god flew away? In some way, he suggests, the shape of things to come is contained in its origin. But can humans discern it? That's the question. Now all this stuff about gyres and cycles and mystical systems, it's pretty out there. Clearly it isn't in any way scientific or even very specific. There's a real debate about whether Yeats believed any of it. Probably in some way he did. But what was clearly more important to him was having a unified system in the first place. Because it was from the many symbols of this unity that Yeats was able to extract his strongest poetry. Having that matrix of sliding meanings to work with, so tightly and intricately woven, meant that pulling one string, evoking one symbol, laying one idea into the form and meter of a sonnet, would make the rest of the web light up like a Christmas tree, signifying a complexity that invites the reader into a number of simultaneous interpretations. By situating the poem at a fulcrum in history equal to our own, we're forced to look both at what we're coming out of and what we're heading toward. A relevant question for any age, particularly relevant for Yeats' own when the trauma of World War I must have come like a sudden blow. By posing questions of possible resistance to this brutal act, but showing no resistance on the part of Leda, even possible enjoyment, the readers themselves are called on to imagine how we resist oppression and the nature of resistance itself, both from a feminist point of view and a political one. By depicting an encounter with the divine so savagely, we're asked to examine the price of inspiration. And by posing questions without giving answers, the knowledge and the power of poetry itself is called into question. All these things are compressed into Yeats' Leda and the Swan, spring-loaded, triggered by an image or a tense or a pun or a slant rhyme. That so much could be packed into 14 lines and 113 words is a testament both to Yeats and the continuing importance of poetry. All that's left is to pull one string and see what sublime network of meanings lights up. Hey everybody, thank you so much for watching. I had so much fun putting this video together. I love this poem. I said in the last video that I'm doing the nerdwriter full-time now and this is the kind of quality of content that I can make with this time and this effort. And it's all possible because you guys have been pledging to the channel on Patreon and I want to continue to ask to donate a little bit of your money to this channel because there is so much more that I want to do and I'm so excited for the stuff that's coming up. So as little as a dollar, you can click right here on the screen right now. Everything helps. Thank you again so much. If you want to check out another video, you can see my analysis of In the Mood for Love, which I did a couple weeks ago. Great movie. I want to expand this series into a lot of different art forms and mediums, comics, even maybe music, TV, lots of cool stuff. I think there's just a lot of opportunity for really awesome stuff and then some stuff that isn't understanding art is coming up too. So thank you again and I will see you next time.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1931\n","\n","Link  223 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/GfqD5WqChUY\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/GfqD5WqChUY\n","[youtube] GfqD5WqChUY: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] GfqD5WqChUY: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 5.10MiB in 01:37\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Why is David Fincher in my head? I was thinking about this a lot while watching his new Netflix series, Mindhunter. I'd watch an episode or two, go to the kitchen to get a drink, and everything would look Fincher-esque, like my eyes were mimicking his camera movement somehow. First I was creeped out, then I was impressed, and then I was curious. What about his filmmaking causes this effect? Because there are plenty of other amazing stylistic directors whose visual styles don't hijack your senses, like Fincher does. And it's the same with all his movies and TV shows. I checked, I went back through all of them to see if I could locate the source of this quality, and I think I found it here. Did you see that? It's a very small thing, and it's easy to miss, but the more I watch Fincher's work, the more it stands out as a key element of his visual language. What is it exactly? Well, it's a camera move. In this case, a tilt. In this case, a pan. In this case, a tracking shot. And in this case, all three. These things are the most common tools in the filmmaker's toolbox. You can find them in pretty much any film you watch, but Fincher has a very specific way of using them, which falls in line with his reputation as a perfectionist. Essentially, what he tries to do is have the camera exactly match the velocity and direction of the moving character in the frame. When the character stops, the camera stops too, and starts again when the person starts to move again. The matching movement here isn't just close. It's perfect. So perfect, in fact, that it must involve some kind of timed rehearsal with the actors, which I learned when I tried to do it myself earlier. This is no doubt a part of the reason why Fincher is known for doing so many takes. It takes patience and a good camera operator to get these moves exactly right. And they're happening all the time, everywhere. In little shots, in between shots, shots you notice and shots you don't. And whether they register or not, the effect starts to accumulate in your mind. All of a sudden, Fincher's reality is your reality. Now, I think there's a very good reason why this happens. And it's a bit counterintuitive when you consider that Fincher's camera work is often regarded as impersonal or coldly omniscient, even by Fincher himself. I think that's somewhat disingenuous, because what these shots do is effectively lock you in to the behavior of the characters. You really feel it when someone moves around the space that they're in. Even small gestures, like a shrug or deflated shoulders, even the slightest change in posture is registered by this camera. In this way, I think Fincher's cinematography is a lot more personal than even he makes out. It might happen just below the level of consciousness, but I'm much more in sync with this character than I am with, for example, this character. It's funny, Fincher's actors have to move in these very deliberate lines at steady speeds, probably ironed out by rehearsal. But the result, at least for me, is a greater connection to the character than something that is more free form, less exact. I mean, it's no surprise that Fincher would pay attention to details like this. Listen to the advice he gave Robin Wright when she directed her first episode of House of Cards. Every scene you direct, every scene you act in, it's the same thing. What's that? He said, behavior over time. It's a fraction. So behavior is the most important thing of every piece of material that you read, that you perform in, and you direct. Look at the behavior. David Fincher is obsessed with behavior. He knows that the way a person moves is a key part of who they are and what they want. He knows that if a person is running and the camera follows that running exactly, then it's like the audience is running too. He knows that the truth of exasperation is in the speed someone lurches forward. He knows that fear can express itself in exactly how slow someone stands up, or that when a person floats back in astonishment, the camera should float with them. It's not a coincidence that emotion has the word motion in it. Emotions express themselves physically. What Fincher does is put his camera in lockstep with the body to capture that physicality. And as a result, we develop this almost unconscious connection with his characters. But the trick works almost too well.

Seriously, it's not very technical and it's a bit tedious, but just tallying every time there's a cut forces you to see things in a different way. It kills the illusion just enough that the nuts and bolts start to come into view. For example, let's take a look at Pete D. Anderson's There Will Be Blood. Already by the third shot, I noticed a camera technique that would be used again and again throughout the film. This heavy emphasis on double and triple framing in single shots. Anderson and cinematographer Robert Elswit were clearly interested in making a movie comprised largely of long takes, but they keep up the momentum by collapsing multiple shots into one. Things never drag on or get too boring, which is definitely a consideration when your movie is two and a half hours long. In fact, by the end of the 14 and a half minute dialogue free introduction, I was struck by the length of the shots and by how few there actually were. 73 to be exact. And 14 and a half minutes divided by 73 means that each shot on average was about 12 seconds long. That's a really long average shot length by today's standard and something I wasn't expecting Anderson to keep up throughout the rest of the film. This graph, by the way, showing that average shot lengths have decreased over the years comes from the work of Barry Salt, who's been writing about film metrics since the 60s and 70s. And if you want to dive deeper into metrics like these, I highly recommend visiting his website Cinemetrics, where all kinds of data is listed out for literally thousands of movies. But I think the best insights come from doing the counting yourself. For example, one of the things that occurs to you watching There Will Be Blood like this is that the value of a simple cut increases as the number of cuts decreases. It's amazing how impactful a cut can be when you're not watching them happen at breakneck speed. I don't mean to say that films with more cuts are necessarily worse or better, just that a movie like There Will Be Blood finds a lot of power in a common cinematic device. The moment you make a decision, it's very, it's in stark relief to the audience. And there's a lot of a big spotlight on. Now I'm changing perspective. Now I'm telling you something else. With so few cuts, as Tikonur says, the contrast of each is dialed up considerably. And like Daniel Plainview, Anderson and Tikonur mine that contrast for meaning. A lot of times it's literal cutting between dark frames and bright frames or loud moments and quiet ones. Just a quick side note, this sequence right here, by the way, shots 256 to 263 are the quickest cutting in the film by far. Anderson used so few shots that Tikonur had to find ways to artificially add more cuts to build up the momentum of this moment. You can actually see that shots 258 and 260 are just alternate angles of the shots that came before them. It's really good editing. Anyway, other times the contrast is personal. If you wanted to suggest that two characters were different sides of the same coin, for example, arch rivals, but cut from the same cloth. All you need is two shots, one tracking into a character mumbling to himself, bathed in light. Another tracking out from a character mumbling to himself, covered in shadow. What I realized after a while is that there's a domino effect. Longer takes mean more impactful cuts mean more attention to composition. If you want your framing to mean something, then your cuts have to mean something because the cut is where the viewer really sees the framing. And they see it with a fresh memory, almost an after image of the frame that came before. Sometimes it is actually a memory. And if you want your cuts to mean something, then you have to use them sparingly and with care. Every single shot is filled with a kind of anticipation because these cuts are registered consciously on the viewer's mind. We're all waiting for the next one to come. Can everything around here be gone? Sure. PT Anderson knows that anticipation is just a form of focus and he's great at channeling that heightened focus toward the performances. When you have an actor as magnetic as Daniel Day-Lewis, the longer the take, the more you hang on his every word and pause. I see the worst in people, Henry. I don't need to look past seeing them to get all I need. Watching this movie, I noticed that conversations like this are the place with the most frequent editing on average, a necessity of shot-reverse-shot. But even here, everything is deliberate. This sequence, for example, is 16 shots in three and a half minutes. Tickanore holds firm on the wide until Eli makes the key comment. What is it that brought you here, sir? The good Lord's guidance. Now, of course, within that, we're going to develop a lease. He cuts in, but only a little, while Daniel thinks he's still dealing with the father. Then when it's clear Eli is the prime negotiator, the scene locks on close-ups as they battle back and forth. And though I don't know for sure, it looks a lot like Tickanore extended the silences here to augment the intensity. That's good. It works. Giving the shots breathing room on both sides of the dialogue, far from making the scene drag, dials up the emotion considerably. And this is something Anderson does throughout the film. Close-ups are used again and again for moments of silence, just as much for important pieces of dialogue. Pete D. Anderson, like the Coen brothers, is great at casting for faces, and he wants us to watch them as much as listen. And of course, he wants us to watch Daniel Plainview the most, who corrodes with bitterness across a series of close-ups, even as he finds success in the solitude that he craves. I drink your water. I drink it up. Every day. I drink the blood of lamb from bandage tract. There are 678 shots, and there will be blood. Over two and a half hours, that means that each shot is 13.3 seconds on average, more than the introduction. The movie is remarkably consistent on this front. Each hour or half hour taken alone will average somewhere around 12 to 14 seconds. Maybe this is what gives the movie its steady but unrelenting pace, the feeling that you're watching a train, you can't stop. There are tons of ways to deconstruct a movie, but it's amazing what you can learn just from looking at the shots one by one as they go by. For many of us, loving a film means wanting to know how it works. With the spirit of an engineer, we take it apart, twist it, turn it, bend it, and put it back together. Or at least we try to. A great movie will never give up all its secrets, but it will give up some of them. This episode was brought to you by The Great Courses Plus.

The last time ten films were nominated for Best Picture was 1943. The world was at war and Casablanca took home the big prize. It's now time to find out which one of this year's ten great films joins a list that includes that Bogart and Bergman classic. And the winner is... Let me ask you a question. Do you own James Cameron's Avatar? Have you seen it a second time? Me neither. All its visual splendor, innovation, ambition just wasn't enough to suffer through its 178 minutes of derivative, heavy-handed storytelling again. What the hell have you people been smoking out there? Now Avatar isn't the first or the 50th larger-than-life blockbuster with a mediocre narrative, but it's perhaps the worst film to be nominated for Best Picture at the Academy Awards. Certainly the worst to be favored. And the winner is... The Hurt Locker. Captain Bigelow from the Humboldt. Nicholas Sharkey. Its loss to The Hurt Locker in 2010 felt like an assertion of values for an industry that was showing all the signs of a gradual amnesia about what constitutes a great film. For the record, Avatar didn't astonish me visually either. It doubled down on gimmicks that I despise, namely 3D. This is part of what makes me so sad about Christopher Nolan's Interstellar. In a world of James Cameron's and George Lucas's, Nolan is a warrior for stylistic purity. Whereas others seem convinced that cinema needs to move in revolutionary new directions to survive, Nolan sees that the possibilities of two dimensions haven't even come close to being exhausted, let alone fully realized. He's among the last to fight for everything we treasure about celluloid. For this reason and others, it may be unfair to compare Interstellar to Avatar, but I don't think it's unreasonable either. Both films are big, muscular operations that collapse onto weak skeletons. Both force themselves to use characters as vehicles for exposition, then choose to use them as megaphones for awkward philosophical declarations. Love isn't something we invented. It's observable and powerful. It has to mean something. Of course, Interstellar is noticeably smarter than Avatar, but that's not always to its credit. The film operates on so many levels, it's hard to identify which one is meant to be the emotional core. If it's supposed to be the relationship with Cooper, Matthew McConaughey, and his daughter, then why does Nolan devote so little time to it? Like with the Blight destroying Earth's crops, inspiring Cooper's mission to find new worlds, most of the father-daughter relationship has to be inferred by the viewer. Elsewhere in the film, we're subjected to multiple explanations of relativity and gravity and wormholes. Exactly where we want the movie to force inference, it lingers. Where we need more exploration and screen time, it holds back. These criticisms are not new to Nolan's films. None of them are more interested in people than concepts. With smaller budgets and simpler ideas, he was better at keeping everything self-contained. Memento and Batman Begins, for example, are triumphs of airtight storytelling. But as Nolan's reach and funding grows, things seem to be escaping his control. After seeing Inception, my first thought was, where does he go from here? I didn't think you could get any headier than Dreams Within Dreams. I didn't think you could do any more of that signature three-scene intercutting without the novelty dying. I was convinced Inception would force Nolan to regroup. What came next was a tedious final Batman film than this. While there's less intercutting and interstellar, the only instance comes two-thirds through the film and it's predictably rousing. The ideas are even headier, only now there are too many for any one to get its due. The film attempts to accommodate wormholes, time travel, fifth-dimensional beings that may or may not be us from the future, relativity, survival, and love, all while advancing a very anti-avatar message about the environment. We're not meant to restore Earth's delicate biosphere, we're meant to leave it behind. Even Kubrick would have struggled with that much of a conceptual payload. Indeed, it's impossible not to think of 2001 A Space Odyssey while watching Interstellar, though the comparisons it invites aren't generous to the latter. Like Nolan, Kubrick is famous for a lack of humanity in his characters. But where Nolan's leads are often dry and tiresome, Kubrick's are cold and punishing, and those qualities have value in respect to the film's impact. Note the average length of shots in the two movies. You'd be hard-pressed to find many shots longer than five seconds in Interstellar, but it would be difficult to find many less than 20 seconds in 2001. Kubrick forces you to come to terms with something before he lets you see the next thing. Nolan is already five shots ahead of you by the time you grasp how one image fits with the rest. With Kubrick, there's always a U-sized hole demanding engagement, mutating based on when, where, and who you are. Nolan's whiplash of action encourages passivity. Other criticisms were matched by unintentional laughter in the theater. Anne Hathaway's mockish oration on love. Maybe it means something more, something we can't yet understand. Matt Damon's cameo, a lesson in the perils of too much secrecy prior to a film's release. Jessica Chastain was given basically nothing of substance to work with, and Michael Caine's multiple recitations of Dylan Thomas's Do Not Go Gentle Into That Good Night play like something I might write into a screenplay, which is no compliment. Maybe all this is too harsh. The film, after all, is a far cry from bad. Still, I find myself coming down harder on Nolan than on many of his peers, like a teacher might on a favorite student. I have a real stake in Christopher Nolan's work and the kind of work he represents. I enjoy intimate dramas as much as the next filmgoer, but cinema without 70mm IMX spectaculars is an incomplete form. And Nolan is basically the last name in original mega movies with profound ambitions. That's why you should want to see a film like Interstellar, because it would be a shame to miss it. Granger, intelligence, spectacle, and story are not mutually exclusive, and Chris Nolan is stretching the potential of cinema toward their union like no other director. But we have to stick to our assertion of values about what constitutes a great film. Internal consistency, storytelling that challenges not confuses the viewer, and dynamic, deeply drawn characters. These are standards that should remain unaffected by scope or singularity of vision. Hey everybody, thanks for watching. I am back from Paris.

And it occurred to me that symbols like this have come to represent a new kind of emotional currency in Hollywood, the currency of intertextuality. Intertextuality is something in a text, in this case a movie, that is shaped by another text. That could be a film or a book or a play or a song. Intertextuality is something that you can't escape. It's as old as storytelling is. It's how language works. All language reaches back and is informed by how it was used in the past. But today there seems to be a new kind of intertextuality born out of the endless series of sequels, remakes and reboots, adaptations and shared universes. And it's perfectly captured in that Force Awakens clip when the Millennium Falcon is revealed, or later when Han Solo and Chewbacca board their ship, or later still when BB-8 pulls the cover off an old friend. What do we feel in these moments? It's a bit hard to pinpoint, but personally I feel a kind of frisson, a chill. Everything I know about the intertextual object in question unloads onto my mind like the vision Ray gets when she first touches Luke's lightsaber. This is the weapon of a Jedi Knight. Not as clumsy or random as a blast. Intertextual references can point to genre conventions. They can point to the text's influences or cultural and historical contexts. But in this new generation of films, more and more, the intertextual manifests itself as objects, people or situations specifically meant to trigger an emotional response in the viewer. It's weaponized intertextuality. What's a bit troubling about this trend is that increasingly I'm seeing films use this kind of intertextual reference as a dramatic substitute. I mean, why else include Sauron in the Hobbit trilogy, for example, when he appears nowhere in the book. It seems to me that Sauromon, Galadriel, Sauron, that whole plot line was included purely for intertextual payoff. So you could cash out that feeling of, oh, this is what these people were doing. Decades old series are ripe for this kind of thing. And if you want a couple examples of just how cheap these moments can be, just take a look at two big intertextual reveals. My name is Khan. The man you're talking to now, the man inside your head is Ernst Stafford Lowfeld. Surprise, motherfucker. Scenes like this are a kind of unicorn's blood. They'll keep your story alive, but only with half a soul. One of my favorite TV shows when I was a teenager was Smallville. By its very nature, that show was built around intertextual cues. What made the show great in the early seasons was how it took those cues and deconstructed them in unexpected ways, namely in the friendship of Clark Kent and Lex Luthor. Its strength was that fan service payoffs played second fiddle to deeply drawn relationships. But in the later seasons, the show began to lean a little too heavily on intertextual objects and moments from the Superman canon. Really, DC Comics has always had this problem because its heroes are mythological. Batman and Superman are the quintessential intertextual characters. Just seeing them at all is exciting. But the recent Batman v Superman movie directed by Zack Snyder proved that the freeson of having these characters on screen together, of having them fight each other, was just no substitute for strong, intelligent drama. Snyder had a similar issue with his film Watchmen. Almost every shot in that film is a compositional match to the comic its trying to adapt. Now for those who read and love that comic, there certainly is a thrill in seeing those frames and experiencing those intertextual moments come beautifully to life. But when that's all there is, the final feeling is an empty one. I think when cinematic storytelling is confined by an economic situation like this one where 300 million dollar bets have to be safe ones, weaponized intertextuality is going to be an inevitable byproduct. I mean this year alone we have coming up Finding Dory, Independence Day Resurgence, Ghostbusters, The Angry Birds movie, adjacent Bourne sequel, Rogue One, Star Trek Beyond, and Warcraft expect to be flooded with weaponized intertextuality at every turn. As I said before, I don't think franchises and shared universes are bad by default. Quite the opposite. At their best, they build interpretive communities and foster social bonds in an increasingly alienated world. The kind of intertextuality that we're talking about can reflect these good qualities and when it's done right, when it's not a substitute for strong characters and a good story, it can be funny, it can be amusingly subversive, and of course it can add to the drama while still being exciting as hell. K.O. I didn't think that would get a lot of views but people really seem to like it so cool.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 871\n","\n","Link  227 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/X6nnYE61ZY0\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/X6nnYE61ZY0\n","[youtube] X6nnYE61ZY0: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] X6nnYE61ZY0: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 1.40MiB in 00:32\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Hello, my name is Salman.

Well, you might know that your speakers are creating sound and your ears are listening to it. But there's a lot more going on over here. You see, all your speakers are doing right now is vibrating the particles of the air close to it. Then they vibrate the air molecules close to them and so on and so forth. And we call this a sound wave. And eventually when the air molecules close to your ears start vibrating, we hear sound. But how does something as boring as air molecules going back and forth make us experience something like this? Well, for that we need to look at our ear carefully. I mean the entire structure of the ear. So let's look at how the different parts of the ear work together to make us experience sound. So our ear can be divided into three parts. The outer ear, the middle ear and the inner ear. The outer ear starts with the pinna. It's the part that you can see and touch or in my case the part that my mom would twist quite often. Its job is to collect as much sound waves as possible and channel it into the auditory canal. The sound waves pass through the auditory canal and eventually meet the eardrum, which is shown in green over here. The eardrum is a transparent membrane which is super sensitive to the vibrations of the air. So as the air vibrates, even the eardrum starts vibrating just like the skin of a drum. And as you can see, the eardrum also separates the outer ear from the middle ear. This brings us to the middle ear. The middle ear consists of the three tiniest bones of the human body and they're together called the ossicles. And they have pretty cool names. They're called the malleus, the incus and stapes. And here's the actual picture of these three bones. And because of their shapes, they're also commonly called as the hammer, the anvil and the stirrup. Stirrup is where you rest your feet when you're riding your horse. Alright, so as the eardrum vibrates, you can see the ossicles also start vibrating, transferring the vibrations from the eardrums to the inner ear. Now their main job is to increase or amplify the pressure of the sound waves when it reaches the inner ear. But why do we need to increase the pressure of the sound waves? Because as we will see, the inner ear consists of a liquid, not air. So the vibrations must transfer into a liquid. And you might already know that vibrating or moving particles of liquid is much harder than moving particles of air. Which is why it's very easy for you to swing your arms in the air, but it's pretty difficult to do that inside water, like say in a swimming pool. And so to set this liquid in vibration, the pressure has to be high enough. And in fact, it turns out that our ossicles increase the pressure of the sound about 20 times. But how do they do that? Well, just take a look at the base of the stapes. It has such a small area compared to that of the eardrum. So when the force gets transmitted from the eardrum to the stapes, it gets concentrated in a very tiny area. And you might know when you concentrate force in a very tiny area, you increase its pressure. And that brings us to the inner ear. The inner ear consists of a bony structure, which is shown in purple. Now, as you can see, the top part of the structure consists of three semicircular rings. They help us in maintaining our balance when walking or dancing or whatever we do. So they're not involved in hearing, so not so important for us. The part that's involved in hearing is this snail-like structure. This is called the cochlea. What does it do? Well, although these bones have already started dancing to the music, nothing gets heard until these vibrations are converted to electricity and sent to our brain. And that's exactly what the cochlea does. Now, the cochlea is super complex, and it's also a little mysterious. Even today, there are certain things about it we just don't know. And so we'll definitely not go into the details. But as mentioned earlier, it contains a liquid. And when the stirrup hits our cochlea, this liquid starts vibrating. And then there are some specialized cells in the cochlea that convert these vibrations into electrical signals. And these electrical signals go through the auditory nerves all the way to your brain, where it gets finally interpreted as sound. And the cells of your cochlea are amazing. The electrical impulses that they generate are super sensitive to how loud the sound is or how feeble the sound is, whether it is high frequency or low frequency. And as a result, your brain can differentiate the tiniest differences in the sound. And so you can understand different letters or words or even understand what I'm saying right now. Or hear the different notes of this music. And so to summarize, the outer ear collects the sound waves through the pinna and directs them to the eardrums. The three optical bones of the middle ear amplify these sound waves, transferring it into the cochlea. And the cochlea converts the back and forth vibrations of the particles into electrical signals and sends it to our brain. And regardless of how many words I use to describe what's going on, the very fact that the back and forth movement of the air can be converted into this amazing experience we call sound is truly unfathomable and beyond words.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 971\n","\n","Link  230 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/52ZlXsFJULI\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/52ZlXsFJULI\n","[youtube] 52ZlXsFJULI: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 52ZlXsFJULI: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 10.05MiB in 02:18\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Welcome to the presentation on adding and subtracting fractions. Let's get started. OK, let's start with what I hope shouldn't confuse you too much, this should hopefully be a relatively easy question. If I were to ask you what 1 fourth plus 1 fourth is, let's think about what that means. Let's say we had a pi, and it was divided into four pieces. So this is like saying this first 1 fourth right here, let me do it in a different color. This 1 fourth right here, let's say it's this 1 fourth of the pi, right? And we're going to add it to another 1 fourth of the pi. Let's make it this one. I thought that was a different color. Let me change the color. Pink, this pink 1 fourth is this 1 fourth of the pi. So if I were to eat both 1 fourths, or 1 fourth, and then I eat another 1 fourth, how much have I eaten? Well, you could look from just the picture. I have now eaten two out of the four pieces of the pi. So if I eat 1 fourth of a piece of pi, or 1 fourth of a pi, and then I eat another 1 fourth of a pi, I will have eaten 2 fourths of the pi. And we know from the equivalent fractions module that this is the same thing as I've eaten 1 half of the pi, which makes sense. If I eat 2 out of 4 pieces of a pi, I've eaten 1 half of it. And if we look at it mathematically, what happened here? Well, the denominators, or the bottom numbers, the bottom numbers in the fraction stayed the same. Because that's just the total number of pieces I have in this example, while I added the numerators, which makes sense. I had 1 out of the 4 pieces of pi, then I ate another 1 out of the 4 pieces of pi, so I ate 2 out of the 4 pieces of pi, which is 1 half. Let me do a couple of more examples. What is 2 fifths plus 1 fifth? Well, we do the same thing here. We first check to make sure the denominators are the same. We'll learn in a second what we do when the denominators are different. But if the denominators are the same, the denominator of the answer will be the same. And we just add the numerators. 2 fifths plus 1 fifth is just 2 plus 1 over 5, which is equal to 3 over 5. And it works the same way with subtraction. If I had 3 over 7 minus 2 over 7, that just equals 1 over 7. I just subtracted the 2 from the 3 to get 1, and I kept the denominator the same. Which makes sense. If I have 3 out of the 7 pieces of a pi, and I were to give away 2 out of the 7 pieces of a pi, I'd be left with 1 of the 7 pieces of a pi. So now let's tackle, I think it should be pretty straightforward when we have the same denominator. Remember, the denominator is just the bottom number in a fraction, the numerator is the top number. What happens when we have different denominators? Well, hopefully it won't be too difficult. Let's say I have 1 fourth plus 1 half. Let's go back to that original pi example. Let me draw that pi. OK. So this first 1 fourth right here, let's just color it in, that's this 1 fourth of the pi. And now I'm going to eat another 1 half of the pi. So I'm going to eat 1 half of the pi. So this 1 half, 1 half, I'm going to eat this whole half of the pi. So what does that equal? Well, there's a couple of ways we could think about it. First we could just rewrite 1 half. 1 half of the pi, that's actually the same thing as 2 fourths, right? There's 1 fourth here, and then another fourth here. So 1 half is the same thing as 2 over 4. And we know that from the equivalent fractions module. So we know that 1 fourth plus 1 half, this is the same thing as saying 1 fourth plus 2 fourths, right? And all I did here is I changed the 1 half to a 2 fourths by essentially multiplying the numerator and the denominator of this fraction by 2. And you can do that to any fraction. As long as you multiply the numerator and the denominator by the same number, you can multiply it by anything. And that makes sense, because 1 half times 1 is equal to 1 half, you know that. Well, another way of writing 1 is 1 half times 2 over 2. 2 over 2 is the same thing as 1. And that equals 2 over 4. And the reason why I picked 2 is because I wanted to get the same denominator here. I hope I'm not completely confusing you. Well, let's just finish up this problem. So we have 1 fourth plus 2 fourths, and we know that we just add the numerators 3 and the denominators to the same, 3 fourths. And if we look at the picture, true enough, we have eaten 3 fourths of this pi. Let's do another one, let's do 1 half plus 1 third. Well, once again, we want to get both denominators to be the same, but you can't just multiply one of them to get, there's nothing I can multiply 3 by to get 2, or there's no at least integer I can multiply 3 by to get 2. And there's nothing I can multiply 2 by to get 3, so you have to multiply both of them so they equal each other. And it turns out that what we want for what we'll call the common denominator turns out to be the least common multiple of 2 and 3. Well, what's the least common multiple of 2 and 3? Well, that's the smallest number that's a multiple of both 2 and 3. Well, the smallest number that's a multiple of both 2 and 3 is 6. So let's convert both of these fractions to something over 6. So 1 half is equal to what over 6? You should know this from the equivalent fractions module. Well, if I eat 1 half of a pizza with 6 pieces, I would have eaten 3 pieces, right? That makes sense. 1 is half of 2, 3 is half of 6. Similarly, if I eat 1 third of a pizza with 6 pieces, that's the same thing as 2 over 6. So 1 half plus 1 third is the same thing as 3 sixth plus 2 sixth. And notice, I didn't do anything crazy. All I did is I rewrote both of these fractions with different denominators. I essentially changed the number of pieces in the pi, if that helps at all. And now that we're at this point, then the problem becomes very easy. We just add the numerators. 3 plus 2 is 5. And we keep the denominators the same. 3 over 6 plus 2 over 6 equals 5 sixth. And subtraction's the same thing. 1 half minus 1 third, well, that's the same thing as 3 over 6 minus 2 over 6. Well, that equals 1 over 6. Let's do a bunch of more problems, and hopefully you'll start to get it. And always remember, you can re-watch the presentation, or you can pause it and try to do the problems yourself, because I think sometimes I talk fast. Let me throw you a curve ball. What's 1 tenth minus 1? Well, 1 doesn't even look like a fraction. Well, but you can write it as a fraction. Well, that's the same thing as 1 tenth minus, how can we write 1 so it has the denominator of 10? Right, that's the same thing as 10 over 10. 10 over 10 is 1. So 1 tenth minus 10 over 10 is the same thing as 1 minus 10. Remember, we only subtract the numerators, and we keep the denominator 10. And that equals negative 9 over 10. 1 tenth minus 1 is equal to negative 9 over 10. Let's do another one. Let's do one more. I think that's all I have time for. Let's do minus 1 ninth minus 1 over 4. Well, the least common multiple of 9 and 4 is 36. So that's equal to 36. So what's negative 1 ninth written as where we change the denominator from 9 to 36? Well, we multiply 9 times 4 to get 36. We have to multiply the numerator times 4 as well. So we have negative 1, so it becomes negative 4. And then minus over 36. Well, to go from 4 to 36, we have to multiply this fraction by 9, or we have to multiply the denominator by 9. So you also have to multiply the numerator by 9. 1 times 9 is 9. So this equals minus 4 minus 9 over 36, which equals minus 13 over 36. I think that's all I have time for right now, and I'll probably add a couple more modules. But I think you might be ready now to do the adding and subtracting module.

Is this a camera problem? No, because if I take the same slow motion video outside in sunlight, I don't see any flickering. So clearly the tube light must be flickering for some reason, but why? To answer this question in this video, we will explore the two different kinds of electric current. And so current comes in two flavors. One is called the DC, which stands for direct current. Direct current. And then the other one is called AC, which stands for alternating current. Alternating current. So what is the difference between them? Direct current is a one directional current, meaning you can imagine the current just flows in one direction. If you could visualize the electrons inside this wire, and you can kind of visualize them as, you know, when the current starts, when the electrons start moving, they're moving in the same direction with the same speed, one particular direction, like this, okay? And since the current value is the same all the time, we will see that the bulb keeps glowing with the same amount of brightness constantly all the time. One directional current, DC. Your batteries usually provide this kind of current. Okay, what about alternating current? Well, this is where the current keeps changing its direction continuously. Once the current would flow this way, then the current would change and flow the opposite direction. Then again, it'll go back and forth, back and forth. Again, if you could visualize the electrons over here, now you would see the current is going, the electrons are going back and forth, back and forth, like this. All right, but why does that make our bulb flicker? Why does that happen? Well, let's look at these electrons a little bit carefully and let's do it in slow motion now. As the electrons are going forward, notice when it's about time to change the direction, they first come to a stop and then change the direction. They go back and again, go to a stop and then change the direction, go forward, stop, backward, stop, forward, stop, and so on. Every time the current stops, electrons stops, the current goes to zero. And when the current goes to zero, the filament over here cools down a little bit. And when the filament cools down a little bit, the bulb dims a little bit. Why doesn't the bulb completely switch off when the current goes to zero? Well, that's because, as you can see, the current comes back up very quickly. So it stops only for a fraction of a second. And so during that fraction, the bulb cools down just a little bit and then again heats up, cools down and heats up, cools down and heats up. And that's why we see the bulb flickering like this. And why do you think it flickers 100 times a second? Well, that's because it turns out in India, the current that we get from our main supply changes its direction 100 times a second. So let me just write that down, that seems important. So the current changes direction. Let me just write the current changes direction, changes direction about 100 times per second. All right? And that means the current goes to zero a hundred times in one second. And therefore, when the current goes to zero, that means our filament will cool down about a hundred times a second. And as it is, we'll see the bulb dimming and then coming back up about a hundred times a second. And of course, something very similar is happening with the tube light, it's flickering because of the alternating current. All right, this might bring now more questions to your mind, like why do we choose a hundred times a second? Or why do we even use alternating current in the first place? All right, we'll address these questions towards the end of the video. But let me quickly first talk about the standard way of representing how quickly the current changes its direction. The standard way of doing that is by coming up with a number called frequency. Frequency. What does the frequency represent? It's representing the same thing a little different way. Instead of talking about the number of times the current changes its direction, it talks about the number of times, or number of cycles, cycles the current goes through per second. So number of cycles per second. It turns out that there is an advantage of doing it this way because when we, you know, look into the mathematics of this, it turns out that this is a very nice number to use in our formula. So what is the meaning of the word cycle over here? So whenever things are going back and forth, their motion is repeating itself, that particular motion which starts repeating is what we call a cycle. Let me be more specific. So let's say, let's bring back our electron. We know the electron is going back and forth, so it goes forward, then changes its direction, goes back, changes its direction again, goes forward and so on and so forth, right? This is what the electron is doing. Now notice, once it has gone forward and then comes back, and once it changes direction, then the motion repeats itself. It's the same as before. Again, goes back and changes direction, motion repeats itself. Therefore, since the motion repeats after over here, after it has changed its direction, we will say this is one cycle. Does that make sense? This is one cycle. So cycle is the portion which starts repeating itself. And after this, again, the next cycle begins, and then once the electron comes back and changes its direction, that cycle ends, and the next cycle begins. So this is cycle number two, and then this is cycle number three. And so frequency basically represents how many cycles, how many cycles is this electron going through every second? Now, here's the question. Given that, we know electron changes direction a hundred times in one second, can we figure out how many cycles it is going through in one second? These numbers are related to each other. Can you pause the video and think about this? All right, hopefully you have tried. Since I know the total number of times the electron changes direction in one second, what we can do to figure out the frequency is let's see how many times the electron changes direction in one cycle, okay? So let's look at the first cycle. Electron is going forward, and then whoop, changes its direction over here. So the electron changes its direction over here once, and then it comes back, comes back, comes back, finishes. No, it finishes its cycle when it changes its direction again. All right, why? Because notice next cycle cannot begin unless you change your direction. So the electron finishes its cycle, the first cycle, after changing its direction again. So it changes direction once, it changes its directions second time. So in one cycle, the electron is changing its direction two times. That's important. Same case with the second cycle as well. Goes forward, forward, forward, boop. Changes its direction, goes back, back, back, back, back. Changes direction and gets ready for the next cycle. Then goes forward Changes direction, goes back Changes direction. So in one cycle, the electron is changing its direction two times. So let's write that. One cycle, the electron changes direction, changes direction two times. So if the electron changes direction 100 times, how many cycles is it? Well, notice the cycle is half of the number of times it changes direction, right? So if this is 100, if the electron is changing its direction 100 times, then that means how many cycles must it be? It has to be 100 by two, five cycles, sorry, 50 cycles. 50 cycles. And so in this case, we will say the frequency is 50 cycles per second. Let's write that over here. 50 cycles per second. And cycles per second is also often called hertz, named after the scientist Heinrich Hertz. And so notice if the current is changing its direction or if the current goes to zero 100 times a second, that means the frequency is half of that, 50 hertz. And since this is the standard chosen in India, this is the Indian standard, that means everyone, everywhere in India, we get about 50 hertz frequency of alternating current. This is an Indian standard. In United States, this number is about 120 times per second, which means the frequency would be half of that, 60 hertz in the United States. All right, that's pretty much it. Now let's come back to some of the curious questions that you might have before we end the video. One question you might be wondering is, why 100 times a second? Why not any other number? Well, if the number is too low, let's say it was like two or three times per second, then the flickering will be very obvious to us, right? And in that case, it will be very inconvenient, so it can't be too low. And if you make it very high, then there are some other problems that start coming. And that's why it needs to be high enough, but not too high, and that's why it's about 100 in India or about 120 in the United States. Another question, like the last question we will tackle is, you may be wondering why even go for alternating current in the first place? Why can't we just go with direct current? What's the problem with that? That's an actually very interesting question because it turns out it's got something to do with efficiency of power transfer. So let's look at it in a little bit detail. So here is, let's say, your power station through which the electricity is coming from the electric poles to your houses. Now since the power station is very, very far away, that means the electricity has to travel a long, long distance. And since we have lots of houses, lots and lots of houses, the electric current required will be very high. So that means these transmission cables would have to carry a lot of current, sorry. They'll have to carry a lot of current. Now the problem with carrying a lot of current in the transmission wire is that it heats up the wire and it causes a lot of heating. Heating is loss of energy. And that electrical energy is getting converted to heat. That means most of the electricity is being wasted as heat. Who's gonna pay for that? You, me, or the electric company? It's gonna be bad. It's gonna be a very, very inefficient thing. We can't do business over there. That's why we go for alternating current, not direct current. You might say, how does alternating current solve this problem? Well, when you're using alternating current, what we do is we send very low amount of current through these wires, very low amount of current. Okay? And therefore the heating losses will be very low and that solves our problem. Well, of course, now you might say, okay, if you send low current, then how will we light up our houses? Well, that's where something called a transformer comes in. You may have heard of this. We'll not look in the detail, but what a transformer does is it takes in that low amount of current and then it increases and gives you a high current. That's the specialty of a transformer. It's not magic, of course. It's science. We need to understand how the transformers work and everything, which we'll do in videos of higher grades. But as of now, just remember, just think of it this way. The transformer can take in very low current and convert it into a very high current. This way, we can save a lot of power loss. Now, the main thing over here is that transformers only work on alternating current. So you can only use this trick with alternating current and not the direct current. And that's the main reason why we use alternating, we supply alternating current because we can do it at a very low current and that gives us very low power loss. All right, that's pretty much it. So let's see if we can go ahead and summarize and recall what we learned. First thing, can you recall what AC and DC stand for and what exactly are they? What's the difference between them? Secondly, what is the meaning of the word frequency? What does it mean to say frequency is 50 hertz? Can you more importantly explain why if frequency is 50 hertz, that means that the current is changing its direction 100 times per second. Try to explain this, say, to your friend or to someone in your family. It's a super important concept over here. Finally, can you now explain why we go for AC when it comes to power transmission to all our houses and not DC? If you have difficulties answering these questions, no worries, feel free to go back and re-watch that part of the video.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 2236\n","\n","Link  235 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/HpdMJaKaXXc\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpdMJaKaXXc\n","[youtube] HpdMJaKaXXc: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] HpdMJaKaXXc: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 11.77MiB in 02:57\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Let's try to learn a thing or two about ratios. So ratios are just expressions that compare quantities. So that might just be a fancy way of saying something that you may or may not understand. So let me give you actual examples. If I have 10 horses and I have 5 dogs, and someone were to come to me and say, Sal, what is the ratio of horses to dogs? So I want to know how many horses do I have for some number of dogs. So I could say I have 10 horses for every 5 dogs. So I could say the ratio of horses to dogs is 10 to 5. Or I could also write that as a fraction. I could say the ratio of horses to dogs is 10 to 5. Or I could just write it out. I could say it is 10 to 5. These all are saying the same thing. And the thing I write first, or the thing that I write on top, is the number of horses. So this is the number of horses right there. That's the number of horses. And that's all the number of horses. If I want to talk about the number of dogs, this is the number of dogs. That's the number of dogs. Or that's the number of dogs. I'm just, these are all just expressions that are comparing two quantities. Now, I just said I have 10 horses for every 5 dogs. But what does that mean? That means I have 5 horses for every one dog. Sorry, not 5 horses for every one dog. That means I have 2 horses for every one dog. If for 5 dogs I have 10, that means for every one of these dogs, there are 2 horses. For every one of these dogs, there are 2 horses. For every two of these horses, there's one dog. I just kind of reasoned through that. So this is, I have 2 horses for every one dog. But how do you get there? How do you get from 10 to 5 to 2 to 1? Well, you can think of what's the biggest number that divides into both of these numbers? What's their greatest common divisor? I have a whole video on that. But the biggest number that divides into both of these guys is 5. So you divide both of them by 5, and you can kind of get this ratio into a reduced form. If I write it here, it would be the same thing as 2 to 1, or 2 to 1. And so what's interesting about ratios, it isn't literally, or doesn't always have to be literally, the number of horses and the numbers of dogs you have. What a ratio tells you is how many horses do I have for every dog, or how many dogs do I have for every horse. Now, just to make things clear, what if someone asked me what is the ratio of dogs to horses? So what's the difference in these two statements? Here I said horses to dogs. Here I'm saying dogs to horses. So since I've switched the ratio, what I'm looking for, I'm looking for the ratio of dogs to horses, I've switched the numbers. So dogs for every five dogs, I have 10 horses. Or if I divide both of these by 5 for every one dog, I have five horses. So the ratio of dogs to horses is 5 to 10, or 1 to 5. Or you could write it this way. Let me write it down here. 1 to 5, or I could write 1 to 5. And the general convention, this wouldn't be necessarily incorrect. That's not wrong, but the general convention is to get your ratio, or your fraction if you want to call it that, into the simplest form, or into this reduced form right there. So let's just do a couple of other examples. Let's say I have 20 apples. Let's say I have 40 oranges. And let's say that I have 60 strawberries. Now what is the ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries? I could write it like this. I could write, what is the ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries? Well, I could start off by literally saying, well, for every 60 strawberries, I have 40 oranges, and I have 20 apples. And this would be legitimate. You could say the ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries are 20 to 40 to 60. And that wouldn't be wrong, but we saw before we could put it into reduced form. So think of what's the largest number that divides into all three of these? We can't just do it into two of these now, because now my ratio has three actual quantities. Well, the largest number that divides into all of these guys is 20. So if we divide all of them by 20, we can then say, for every one apple, I now have, if you divide this guy by 20, I have two oranges, and I have three strawberries. So the ratio of apples to oranges to strawberries is 1 to 2 to 3. And I got that, in every case, by just dividing these guys all by 20. I divided by 20. I think you get the general idea. If someone were to ask you what's the ratio of, let me just write it down, because it never hurts to have a little bit more clarification. If someone wanted to know the ratio of strawberries to oranges, let me get into my orange color, strawberries to oranges to apples. I thought I was going to do that in yellow. Two apples. What is this ratio going to be? Well, for every three strawberries, I have two oranges, and I have one apple. So then it would be 3 to 2 to 1. The general idea is, whatever order someone asks you for the different items, the ratio is going to be in that same exact order. Now, in all of the examples so far, I gave you the ratio of things we had, and we figured out the ratio. What if it went the other way? What if it went the other way? What if I told you a ratio? What if I said the ratio of boys to girls in a classroom is, let's say the ratio of boys to girls is 2 to 3, which I could have also written as 1 to 3. Let's say the ratio of boys to girls is 2 to 3, which I could have also written as 2 to 3, just like that. So for every two boys, I have three girls. Or for every three girls, I have two boys. And let's say that there are 40 students in the classroom. And then someone were to ask you, how many girls are there? How many girls are in the classroom? So this seems a little bit more convoluted than what we did before. We know the total number of students, we know the ratio, but how many girls are in the room? So let's think about it this way. The fact that the ratio of boys to girls, I'll write it like this. Maybe I'll be stereotypical with the colors. The ratio of boys to girls is equal to 2 to 3. Hate to be so stereotypical, but it doesn't hurt. 2 to 3. The ratio of boys to girls is 2 to 3. So this says for every three girls, there's two boys. For every two boys, there's three girls. But what does it also say? It also says for every five students, there are what? There are two boys and three girls. There are two boys and three girls. Now why is this statement helpful? Well, how many groups are there? It's helpful. Well, how many groups of five students do I have? I have 40 students in my class right there. I have 40 students in my class. And for every five students, there are two boys and three girls. So how many groups of five students do I have? So I have a total of 40 students. Let me do it in this purple color. So there are 40 students, and then there are five students per group. And I figured out that group just by looking at the ratio. For every five students, I have two boys and three girls. So how many groups of five students do I have? So that means that I have eight groups, 40 divided by 5, groups of five students. Now we're wondering how many girls there are. So each group is going to have three girls. Each group has three girls. So each group has three girls. Each group has three girls. So how many girls do I have? I have eight groups. Each of them have three girls. So I have eight groups times three girls per group is equal to 24 girls in the classroom. And you could do the same exercise with boys. How many boys are there? There's a couple ways you could do it. You could say, well, for every group, there are two boys. There's eight groups. There's 16 boys. Or you could say, look, there's 40 students. 24 of them are girls. 40 minus 24 is 16. So either way, you could get to 16 boys. And if you want to think of a kind of a fast way to do it, and it would be identical, you'd say, look, 2 plus 3 is 5. So for every five students, two boys, three girls. How many groups are there? You say 40 divided by 5 is equal to eight groups. Every group has three girls. So you do 8 times 3 is equal to 24 girls. Let's do one that's a little bit harder than that. Let's do one where I say that the ratio of, let's go back to, let's go to the farm example. The ratio of sheep, I'll do sheep and white. The ratio of sheep to, I don't know, chickens. To chickens. I don't know, what's another farm animal? To pigs. The ratio of sheep to chicken to pigs. Maybe I should just say chicken right there. The ratio of sheep to chicken to pigs, or chickens. I should say chickens. Let's say the ratio is 2 to 5, 2 to 10. And notice, I can't reduce this anymore. There's no number that divides into all of these. So this is the ratio of sheep to chickens to pigs. And let's say that I have a total of 51 animals. So I have a total of 51 animals. And I want to know how many chickens do I have? How many chickens? How many chickens do I have? Well, we do the same idea. For every two sheep, I have five chickens and I have 10 pigs. That tells me for every 17 animals, so for every 17 animals, so every group of 17 animals, what do I have? And where did I get 17 from? I just added 2 plus 5 plus 10. So for every 17 animals, I'm going to have, let me pick a new color, I'm going to have two sheep, five chickens, and 10 pigs. Now, how many groups of 17 animals do I have? I have a total of 51 animals. So if there's 17 animals per group, 51 animals divided by 17 animals per group, I have three groups of 17 animals. Now, I want to know how many chickens. Every group has five chickens. Every group has five chickens. We already know that. And I have three groups. So I have three groups, every group has five chickens, so I'm going to have three times five chickens, which is equal to 15 chickens. Not too bad. All I did is add these up and say, for every 17 animals, I've got five chickens. I've got three groups of 17. So for each of those groups, I have five chickens. Three times five is 15 chickens. And you could use the same process to figure out the number of sheep or pigs you might have.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 2052\n","\n","Link  236 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/Cm8kRFMxsf0\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/Cm8kRFMxsf0\n","[youtube] Cm8kRFMxsf0: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] Cm8kRFMxsf0: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 1.33MiB in 00:16\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Hi everyone, Sal Khan here from Khan Academy. And I just wanted to remind you that we are a not-for-profit and we can only exist through donations from folks like yourself. Our goal is for everyone to reach their potential. Potential is everywhere. Unfortunately, access is not. And that's what Khan Academy exists to change. We are trying to reach tens of millions of students around the world, students in historically under-resourced communities, working with school districts in the US, working with stakeholders from around the planet to make sure that students have a way to fill in their gaps, learn at their own time and pace, have access to truly rigorous course materials. So I encourage you to think about supporting Khan Academy. The social return on investment on Khan Academy, we're about the budget of a large high school, but we reach already a chunk of humanity and we wanna reach many, many more with over 140 million registered users today and hopefully billions going forward. So please think about making a donation if you've benefited from Khan Academy, you know from folks who've benefited from Khan Academy, or maybe most importantly, if you wanna see tens to hundreds of millions to billions of other students benefit from these resources, please think about making a donation. Thank you.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 220\n","\n","Link  237 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/7XaftdE_h60\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/7XaftdE_h60\n","[youtube] 7XaftdE_h60: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 7XaftdE_h60: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 7.22MiB in 01:45\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  So what you're looking at is one of the most amazing organs in your body. This is the human heart, and it's shown with all the vessels on it, and you can see the vessels coming into it and out of it. But the heart at its core is a pump, and this pump is why we call it the hardest working organ in our body, because it starts pumping blood from the point where you're a little fetus, maybe about eight weeks old, all the way until the point where you die. And so this organ, I think it would be really cool to look at in a little bit more detail, but it's hard to do that looking just at the outside. So what I did is I actually drew what it might look like on the inside. So let me actually just show you that now, and we'll follow the path of blood through the heart using this diagram. Let me start with a little picture in the corner. So let's say we have a person here, and this is their face, and this is their neck. I'm going to draw their arms, and they have in the middle of their chest their heart. And so the whole goal is to make sure that blood from all parts of their body, including their legs, can make its way back to the heart, first of all, and then get pumped back out to the body. So blood is going to come up from this arm, let's say, and dump into there, and the same on this side, and it's going to come from their head. And all three sources, the two arms and the head, are going to come together into one big vein, and that's going to be dumping into the top of the heart. And then separately, you've got veins from the legs meeting up with veins from the belly coming into another opening into the heart. So that's how the blood gets back to the heart. And anytime I mention the word vein, I just want you to make sure you think of blood going towards the heart. Now if blood is going towards the heart, then after the blood is pumped by the heart, it's going to have to go out to the heart. It's going to have to go away from the heart. So that's the aorta, and the aorta actually has a little arch like that, and we call it the aortic arch. And it sends off one vessel to the arm, one vessel up this way, a vessel over this way, and then this arch kind of goes down, down, down, and splits like that. So this is kind of a simplified version of it, but you can see how there are definitely some parallels between how the veins and the arteries are set up. And arteries, so anytime I mention the word artery, I want you to think of blood going away from the heart. And an easy way to remember that is that they both start with the letter A. So going to our big diagram now, we can see that blood coming in this way and blood coming in this way is ending up at the same spot. It's going to end up at the, actually maybe I'll draw it here, is ending up at the right atrium. That's just the name of the chamber that the blood ends up in. And it came into the right atrium from a giant vessel up top called the superior vena cava, and this is a vein, of course, because it's bringing blood towards the heart. And down here, the inferior vena cava. Inferior vena cava. So these are the two directions that blood is going to be flowing. And once blood is in the right atrium, it's going to head down into the right ventricle. So this is the right ventricle down here. This is the second chamber of the heart. And it gets there by passing through a valve. And this valve and all valves in the heart are basically there to keep blood moving in the right direction. So it doesn't go in the backwards direction. So this valve is called the tricuspid valve. And it's called that because it's basically got three little flaps. That's why they call it tri. And I know you can only see two in my drawing, and that's just because my drawing is not perfect. And it's hard to show kind of a flap coming out at you, but you can imagine it. So blood goes into the right ventricle. And where does it go next? Well, after that, it's going to go this way. It's going to go into this vessel, and it's going to split. But before it goes there, it has to pass through another valve. So this is a valve right here called a pulmonary valve. And it gives you a clue as to where things are going to go next, right? Because the word pulmonary means lungs. And so if this is my lung on this side, this is my left lung, and this is my right lung on this side, then these vessels, and I'll let you try to guess what they would be called. These vessels, this would be my, make sure I get my right and left straight, this is my left pulmonary artery. And I hesitated there just to make sure you got that because it's taking blood away from the heart. And this is my right pulmonary artery. So this is my right and left pulmonary artery. And so blood goes now into my lungs, right? These are the lungs that are kind of nestled into my thorax where my heart is sitting. Goes into my lungs. And remember, this blood is blue. Why is it blue? Well, it's blue because it doesn't have very much oxygen. And so one thing that I need to pick up is oxygen. And so that's one thing that the lungs are going to help me pick up, and I'm going to write O2 for oxygen. And it's also blue, and that reminds us that it's full of carbon dioxide. It's full of waste because it's coming from the body, right? The body's made a lot of carbon dioxide that it's trying to get rid of. So in the lungs, you get rid of your carbon dioxide and you pick up oxygen. So that's why I switch at this point from a blue-colored vessel to a red-colored vessel. So now blood comes back in this way and dumps into this chamber. So what is that? This is our left atrium. Our left atrium. So just like our right atrium, we have one on the left. And it goes down into, and you can probably guess what this one is called, it's our left ventricle. So just like before, where it went from the right atrium to the right ventricle, now we're going from the left atrium to the left ventricle. And it passes through a valve here, right? So this valve is called the mitral valve. And its job is, of course, to make sure that blood does not go from the left ventricle back to the left atrium. By accident. It wants to make sure that there's forward flow. And then the final valve, and I have to find a nice spot to write it, maybe right here. This final valve that it passes through is called the aortic valve. And the aortic valve is going to be what divides the left ventricle from this giant vessel that we talked about earlier. And this is, of course, the aorta. This is my aorta. So now blood is going to go through the aorta to the rest of the body. So you can see how blood now flows from the body into the four chambers. First into the right atrium, this is chamber number one. And then it goes into the right ventricle, this is chamber number two. It goes to the lungs and then back out to the left atrium. This is chamber number three. And then the left ventricle. And this happens every moment of every day. Every time you hear your heart beating, this process is going on.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1395\n","\n","Link  238 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/Qh-M3_L4xYk\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qh-M3_L4xYk\n","[youtube] Qh-M3_L4xYk: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] Qh-M3_L4xYk: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 7.95MiB in 02:40\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  In this video, I want to give you a general idea of what a bond is and why a company might even issue them in the first place. And just at a very high level, a bond is essentially a way for someone to participate in lending to a company. So you're a partial lender to a company. And just to make that more concrete, let's imagine some type of company that has $10 million in assets. So these are its assets right there. Assets. And it has $10 million in assets. And let's say, just for the sake of simplicity, it has no liabilities, so all of that value, all of that $10 million is what is owned by the owners or by the equity, the owner's equity. So this is $10 million in equity. And if we had, let's say, a million shares, I'll write down, if we have a million shares. And if we believe this $10 million number, that implies that each share is worth $10 per share. Now let's say this company is doing really well and it wants to expand. It wants to increase its assets by $5 million so it can go out and buy a $5 million factory. So it wants, let me draw it right here, it wants another $5 million in assets that it needs to build that factory, or essentially a $5 million factory. And the question is, how does it finance it? Well, one way is that they could just issue more equity. If they're able to get a price of $10 per share, they could issue another 500,000 shares at $10 per share. And then that would essentially produce $5 million. So this is scenario one. They issue 500,000 shares at $10 a share. They now have 1.5 million shares. But these new owners gave them collectively $5 million. So the equity would grow by $5 million. We now have 1.5 million shares. So this would now be 1.5 million shares, not $1 million. And that new money from these new shareholders would go into the asset side and then we would use that to actually buy the factory. What I just described is essentially issuing equity or financing via equity. Or by issuing stock. Now, the other way to do it is to borrow the money. So let me redraw this company. I'll leave this up here just so we can compare the two. So once again, we have $10 million of assets. That's our $10 million of assets. We have $10 million of equity to start off with. $10 million of equity. And instead of issuing stock to get the $5 million, we're going to borrow the money. So we're essentially issuing debt. So we could go to a bank and say, hey, bank, can I borrow $5 million? So we would have a $5 million equity. $5 million liability would be debt. $5 million of debt. And the bank would give us $5 million of cash that we can then go use to buy our factory. So in either situation, the asset side of our balance sheet looks identical, or the assets of the company are identical. We had our $10 million assets and now we have a factory. But in this first situation, I was able to raise that money by increasing the number of shareholders, by increasing the number of people that I have to split the profits of this company with. In this situation, I was able to raise the money by borrowing it. So the people that I'm borrowing this money from, the people that I'm borrowing this money, this is borrowed money. They don't get a cut of the profits of this company. What they do is they get paid interest on their money that they're lending to us before these guys get any profits at all. In fact, that interest is considered an expense. So these guys get interest. And even if this company does super, super well and becomes very, very profitable, these guys only get their interest. Likewise, if the company does really bad and these guys suffer, as long as the company doesn't go bankrupt, these guys are still going to get their interest. So they're going to be a lot safer than, well, they don't get as much of the reward as the new equity holders would. They also don't get as much of the risk. Now, this is just straight up debt. And you could just get this from any bank if they were willing to. If they said, oh, you're a good, safe company. We're willing to lend you $5 million. But let's say that no bank wants to individually take on that risk. So you say, hey, instead of borrowing $5 million from one entity, why don't I borrow it from 5,000 entities? So what I can do instead, instead of borrowing it from one entity, I could issue these certificates. I could issue bonds. And that's the topic of this video. So I issue these certificates. They have a face value of $1,000. This is my face value. Or sometimes you'll hear the notion of par value. And I'll say what interest I'm going to pay on it. So let's say it has a 10% annual coupon. And it's actually called, even though this is the interest, I'm essentially going to pay $100 a year, it's called a coupon because when bonds were first issued, they would actually throw these little coupons on the bond itself. And the owner of the certificate could rip off or cut off one of these coupons and then go to the person borrowing or the entity borrowing the money and get their actual interest payment. So that's why it's actually called coupons. But they don't actually attach those coupons anymore. And then it has some maturity date. The date that not only will I pay your interest back, but I'll pay the entire principal, the entire face value. So let's say the maturity is in two years. So in this situation, in order to raise $5 million, I'm going to have to issue 5,000 of these. Because 5,000 times 1,000 is 5 million. So times 5,000. So if you wanted to lend $1,000 to this company so that they could expand, and if you think 10% is a good interest rate and it's a safe company, you would essentially buy one of these bonds. Maybe you buy it for $1,000. And when you buy that bond for $1,000, you are essentially lending this company that $1,000. And if you did that 5,000 times, or if that happened 5,000 times amongst a bunch of different people, this company would be able to raise its $5 million. Now just to be clear how the actual payments work, the coupons tend to get paid semi-annually. So let me draw a little timeline here. And this tends to be the case in the US and Western Europe. If this is today, this is today, this is in six months, this is in 12 months or one year, this is in 18 months, and this is in 24 months. And I'm only going up to 24 months because I said this bond matures in 24 months. So what is this, if you own, if you hold this bond, this certificate, what do you get? Well, it's going to pay you 10% annually, so $100 a year. But they actually pay the coupon semi-annually. So you get $100 a year, but you get half of it every six months, so you're going to get $50 after six months. You're going to get $50 after 12 months or after another six months. You're going to get another $50 here. You're going to get a final $50 there. And they're also going to have to pay you back the original amount of the loan. They're also going to have to pay you the $1,000. So that last payment is going to be the coupon of $50 plus the $1,000. And so you will have essentially been getting this 10% annual interest. Now when the company does this, they'll probably have to issue some type of new bond because all of a sudden they have to pay all of these people this huge lump sum of money if they haven't been able to earn it from the factories yet. And we could talk about that in a future video.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1416\n","\n","Link  239 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/ZS_Au46ub3Y\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZS_Au46ub3Y\n","[youtube] ZS_Au46ub3Y: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] ZS_Au46ub3Y: Downloading webpage\n"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["ERROR: unable to download video data: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden\n"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Skipped 239\n","\n","\n","Link  240 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/h9cc7szYWsM\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/h9cc7szYWsM\n","[youtube] h9cc7szYWsM: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] h9cc7szYWsM: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 2.78MiB in 00:53\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  you you you you you you\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 6\n","\n","Link  241 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/IrSutgvecNA\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/IrSutgvecNA\n","[youtube] IrSutgvecNA: Downloading webpage\n","[youtube] IrSutgvecNA: Downloading MPD manifest\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] IrSutgvecNA: Downloading webpage\n","[youtube] IrSutgvecNA: Downloading MPD manifest\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 18.13MiB in 05:39\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  7 Days a Week by Cynthia Platt Cody was looking at the kids club calendar. Do you know what's funny? What? asked Sandy. There are seven days of the week, Cody said. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. Why is that funny? Sandy asked. Well, there are things I do just one day a week, Cody said, and things I do all seven days of the week. That's true, Sandy said. I only see my grandma one day a week. And I go to soccer practice three days a week, but not all seven, Cody said. What are things you do on all seven days? Sandy asked. I take a bath seven days a week, Cody said. And I read bedtime stories seven days a week, said Sandy. Cool beans, said Cody. I read stories all seven days too. Do you know what else I like to do seven days of the week? Sandy asked. Hang out with me, Cody said. Of course, Sandy replied. Neat as Nine by Cynthia Platt Ollo wished Cody would come back to help clean up the nine dolls she had left out on the floor. But Cody wasn't around to neaten things up. Peck flew in to say hello. Will you help me put these dolls away? Ollo asked. Of course, Peck said. I'll put this one in the toy box. But then I still have to put most of them away, said Ollo. Can we split them up a different way? Peck pointed to three dolls. I'll take these. Hmm, said Ollo. Maybe you could put away four dolls and I could put away five? That sounds good, said Peck. Then we can go have cookies. Ollo and Peck found nine cookies in the snack area. Just then, Cody arrived. Cool beans, cookies, Cody said as she took some. I've come to help you eat them. Being Together by Cynthia Platt Cody wanted to play a game, but no one was around. Ollo was sick. Sandy was at a music lesson. She looked for Peck, but he was napping. Cody was all alone. She didn't like to be alone. Cody looked up. Reya was reading in a tree. She wasn't by herself anymore. What are you doing? Cody asked Reya. Reading a new book about snakes, Reya replied. Do you want to play? Cody asked. Reya smiled. Not now. This is a really good book, she said. Cody frowned. Reya closed her book. Do you want to sit quietly with me? She asked. Cody did. But Cody was not good at sitting quietly. She squirmed. She wiggled. She even sang and danced. Reya closed her book again. I said sit quietly, she told Cody. This is not quiet. Cody tried to sit still. But she couldn't. She didn't want to be alone. But Reya clearly did. Cody walked to the pool. Being at the pool didn't help though. Being alone was so boring and Cody really wanted to play. Want to read this, Reya said? I think you'll like it. The book was about boats. Cody loved it. Reya read about snakes. Cody read about boats. And it was like they were alone but together. Hero in Training by Cynthia Platt Cody was reading comic books about superheroes. The heroes all sounded brave and thoughtful and strong. I want to be a hero too, Cody said. But how can I become one? I'll have to learn how to fly, said Cody. There was only one friend Cody knew who could fly. Peck, I need you to teach me how to fly, she said. That sounds like a fun idea, Peck replied. Let's do it. First you need to flap your wings, Peck said. Cody tried but her arms did not take her up in the air. Jump off this bench and try, Peck told her. There was no way Cody could fly though. Are there other things heroes can do? Peck asked. Yes, said Cody. They can lift heavy things. Cody tried to lift a huge rock but it was too heavy. Maybe I should try to squeeze into a tight space, said Cody. One of the heroes in my comics did that. I think you'll be good at that one, Peck told her. Sadly, Peck was wrong. I know, Cody exclaimed. I'll transform into my secret identity. Heroes all have those. Cody came back with a disguise. Hi, Cody, Peck said. You know who I am? Cody asked. Of course, replied Peck. Maybe I need a mask and cape, Cody said. I have both of those in my room, Peck told her. So Cody put on a mask and cape. I look like a hero, Cody said, but I haven't done anything heroic. Could you help me tie this? asked Peck. Tying this cape on is tough. Cody tied the cape and helped Peck put on his mask. Thanks, said Peck. You're my hero. Your hero? Cody replied. I finally did it. Something New by Cynthia Platt Cody sat alone at a table. This was not like her. What are you thinking about? Allo asked. Everything is different here, Cody said, and I'm the only one who's new. New can be exciting, Allo said. Yes, Cody agreed, but I'd like to know where everything is, and I don't yet. Allo had an idea. Let's go on a trip, Allo said, and get souvenirs as we go. A trip? Cody asked. Where? First we're going to the beach, Allo told her. It wasn't really a beach, but Cody didn't mind. That was fun, said Allo. Let's rest in the sand for a while. Cody put some sand in a jar to keep. Where should we go now? asked Cody. To the restaurant, of course, replied Allo. I think I know where I want to go next, Cody said. Where? Allo asked. The art museum, Cody said. The art museum is my favorite place to be, Allo said. I like your paintings the best, Cody said. Do you want me to make one for you? Allo asked. Yes, Cody said, but I have an even better idea. You can use these, Cody said. Great idea, said Allo. It will be the best art ever, agreed Cody. It's very new and different, Allo said. And new can be very exciting, Cody said, laughing. A Special Place by Cynthia Platt Sandy's room is a special place. It's a sunny space filled with fun toys and musical instruments. Best of all, it has posters, pictures, and souvenirs from Australia everywhere. One day, Peck popped over to visit. He looked around her room. Have you ever been to Australia? he asked. I was born there, Sandy replied. Wow, Peck said. I didn't know that. My parents and I packed up our stuff and came here on a plane, Sandy told him. Peck pointed at the map. So you flew all the way from there? We spent hours in the air, Sandy said. I brought some souvenirs with me, Sandy said. Want to see them? Yes, Peck cheered. Sandy showed him a picture of a beach she loved. Then she pointed out her friend, Pat the Platypus. Were you sad to leave? Peck asked. Part of me was sad, Sandy said, but part of me is happy to be here too. What do you miss most? Peck wondered. My pals, Sandy told him, and the sports. I loved playing rugby with them. Australia sounds like a special place, Peck told her. It is, Sandy replied, and I love to spend time talking about it. So will you tell me more? Peck asked. Sure, I have so much to show you, said Sandy. Side by side, Sandy and Peck spent the afternoon exploring her room and sharing stories. I'd love to go to Australia someday, Peck said, and I'd love to go with you, Sandy replied. Fun to Read by Katherine Rossett Rhea sat in the sun. She sat in the sun to read. It was fun to read, but it was not fun to sit in the sun. It was hot in the sun. Rhea saw a table. I will sit by the table, she said. If I sit by the table, I will not be hot. Rhea sat by the table. She sat by the table to read. It was not fun to sit by the table. It was hot by the table. Rhea saw a chair. I will sit on the chair, she said. If I sit on the chair, I will not be hot. Rhea sat on the chair. She sat on the chair to read. It was not fun to sit on the chair. It was hot on the chair. Rhea was hot, but her leg was not. My leg is not hot, she said. Why not? This is for you, Rhea, said Peck. It is not hot. No, it is not, said Rhea. It is not hot. Starting to Worry by Cynthia Platt When Cody didn't show up at the kids club for two whole days, Aloe was starting to worry. So he did what he always did when he was worried. He painted. Aloe hoped that Cody would arrive to finish the painting with him. When Cody didn't, Aloe worried more. He started a coloring page to try to feel better. Cody wasn't at the kids club the next morning either. What if she was sick? It was hard to enjoy his art when Aloe was so worried about Cody. I love the colors you used in that painting, Aloe, said Cody when she finally arrived. Aloe was so relieved to see her. Where have you been, he asked. I was on vacation with my family, Cody said, but now I'm back. I'm so happy, Aloe said. Want to make some more art with me? Art always makes me feel better, and so do you. Today we're going to read about dump trucks. Monster Dump Trucks Monster Dump Trucks. Giant dump trucks help builders and miners move heavy loads. Every dump truck has a cab. This is where the driver sits. The bed is the large box behind the cab. It holds sand, dirt, and more. Off-Road Dumpers The largest dump trucks do not travel on roads. They are too big. Some dump trucks are taller than houses. The tires can be taller than a person. People use ladders to climb into these dump trucks. Biggest Dump Trucks. The biggest dump trucks have king-size beds. They carry up to 400 tons. That is the weight of 200 cars. Today we're going to read about baby lions. Cubs. Baby lions are called cubs. They are born in litters of two to four babies. Life in the Pride. Lion cubs live in prides. A pride can have many litters and mothers. Each mom cares for her own litter. The moms work together to protect their cubs from danger. Newborn cubs drink their moms milk. Older cubs eat with the big lions. Mom keeps her cubs clean. She licks their fur. Cubs need a lot of rest. They snuggle close to one another. Playtime. Lion cubs love to run and jump. Brothers and sisters wrestle. Playful cubs also copy mom and dad. They pretend to hunt. This cub wants to be like dad. He shows his scariest face.

Welcome, I'm so glad you could join me. So let's start by asking the question, what is grammar? What is this thing, why is it worthwhile to study it, why would you want to put up with listening to me? Well first of all, grammar is a set of conventions and rules that govern language. So what's the difference between a convention and a rule? Well, a rule is kind of the bare minimum of what it takes to make your language understandable by other people. Right, so in order to make a car work, for example, in order to make it move forward as intended, the wheels have to go on the bottom instead of on the roof. That's a rule. The idea that all cars should be painted teal, for example, is a convention. Now is that true that all cars should be teal? No, not necessarily, but that leads me to my second point, that grammar is context dependent. The kind of grammar that you use throughout your day changes. It depends on who you're talking to, what you're trying to say, and how you're trying to say it. And so we use multiple kinds of grammar throughout our days and throughout our lives. Another thing you need to know is that you already know so much grammar just from living and existing in the world and talking to other people. You know how to put a sentence together. If you can understand me, then you know so much about grammar. You know more than I can teach you. What these videos are for is to give names to the things you already know, to give you a greater command of them. And I wanna say too that these videos are only about a very specific kind of grammar. It's called standard American English. But I want you to know that there are many Englishes. And you know what, they are all great. They are all wonderful and vibrant and important and special. And what I do not want for you to take away from these videos is that I'm trying to teach you what is right and what is wrong. If the kind of English you speak doesn't sound like the kind of English I speak, that is okay. You know, you are great. What I want to do is give you the tools to harness language, to harness English, and use it any way you want. I mean, I'm saying I don't care what color your car is. It could be pink, it could be green, it could be purple, it could be paisley, you know. I'm just trying to make sure your wheels are on straight. You are a grammarian. You have made a study of grammar throughout your entire speaking and reading life. And I firmly believe that you can learn anything. Welcome to Grammar on Khan Academy.

Let's start doing some problems. So let's say I had the equation 5x equals 20. So at first this might look a little unfamiliar for you, but if I were to rephrase this, I think you'll realize this is a pretty easy problem. This is the same thing as saying 5 times question mark equals 20. And the reason why we do the notation a little bit, we write the 5 next to the x because when you write a number right next to a variable, you assume that you're multiplying them. So this is just saying 5 times x, so instead of a question mark, we're writing an x. So 5 times x is equal to 20. Now most of you all could do that in your head. You could say, well, what number times 5 is equal to 20? Well, it equals 4. But I'll show you a way to do it systematically just in case that 5 was a more complicated number. So let me make my pen a little thinner. So rewriting it, if I had 5x equals 20, we could do two things, and they're essentially the same thing. We could say we just divide both sides of this equation by 5, in which case the left-hand side, those two 5's will cancel out, we'll get x. And then the right-hand side, 20 divided by 5 is 4. And we would have solved it. Another way to do it, and this is actually the exact same way, we're just phrasing it a little different. If you said 5x equals 20, instead of dividing by 5, we could multiply by 1 fifth. And if you look at that, you can realize that multiplying by 1 fifth is the same thing as dividing by 5, if you know the difference between dividing and multiplying fractions. And then that gets the same thing. 1 fifth times 5 is 1, so you're just left with an x equals 4. I tend to focus a little bit more on this because when we start having fractions instead of a 5, it's easier to just think about multiplying by the reciprocal. Actually, let's do one of those right now. So let's say I had negative 3 over 4 times x equals 10 over 13. Now this is a harder problem. I can't do this one in my head. We're saying negative 3 fourths times some number x is equal to 10 over 13. If someone came up to you on the street and asked you that, I think you'd be like me and you'd be pretty stumped. But let's work it out algebraically. Well, we do the same thing. We multiply both sides by the coefficient on x. So the coefficient, all that fancy word means is the number that's being multiplied by x. So what's the reciprocal of minus 3 fourths? Well, it's minus 4 over 3 times. And dot is another way to use times. And you're probably wondering why in algebra there are all these other conventions for doing times as opposed to just the traditional multiplication sign. And the main reason is I think just a regular multiplication sign gets confused with the variable x. So they thought of either using a dot if you're multiplying two constants or just writing it next to a variable to imply you're multiplying a variable. So if we multiply the left-hand side by negative 4 thirds, we also have to do the same thing to the right-hand side, minus 4 thirds. The left-hand side, the minus 4 thirds and the 3 fourths, they cancel out. You could work it out on your own to see that they do. They equal 1. So we're just left with x is equal to 10 times minus 4 is minus 40. 13 times 3, well, that's equal to 39. So we get x is equal to minus 40 over 39. And I like to leave my fractions improper because it's easier to deal with them. But you could also view that as minus, if you wanted to write it as a mixed number, minus 1 and 139. I tend to keep it like this, though. Let's check to make sure that's right. The cool thing about algebra is you can always get your answer and put it back into the original equation and make sure you were right. So the original equation was minus 3 fourths times x. And here we'll substitute the x back into the equation. Wherever we saw x, we'll now put our answer. So it's minus 40 over 39. And our original equation said that that equals 10 over 13. And once again, when I just write the 3 fourths right next to the parentheses like that, that's just another way of writing times. So minus 3 times minus 40 is minus 100. And actually, we could do something a little bit simpler. This 4 becomes a 1, and this becomes a 10. If you remember when you're multiplying fractions, you can simplify it like that. So it actually becomes plus 30 because we have a minus times a minus, 3 times 10, over the 4 is now 1, so all we have is left is 39. And 30 over 39, if we divide the top and the bottom by 3, we get 10 over 13, which is the same thing as what the equation said we would get. So we know that we got the right answer. Let's do one more problem. Minus 5 6 x is equal to 7 8. If you want to try this problem yourself, now's a good time to pause. And I'm going to start doing the problem right now. So same thing. What's the reciprocal of minus 5 6? Well, it's minus 6 over 5. We multiply that. If you do it on the left-hand side, we have to do it on the right-hand side as well. Minus 6 over 5. The left-hand side, the minus 6 over 5 and the minus 5 6 cancel out. We're just left with x. And the right-hand side, we can divide both the 6 and the 8 by 2. So this becomes negative 3. This becomes 4. 7 times negative 3 is minus 21 over 20. And assuming I haven't made any careless mistakes, that should be right. Actually, let's just check that real fast. So minus 5 6 times minus 21 over 20. Well, that equals 5. We could make that a 1. Turn this into a 4. Make this into a 2. Make this into a 7. Negative times negative is positive. So we have 7. 2 times 4 is 8. And that's what we said we would get. We got it right. I think you're ready at this point to try some level 1 equations. Have fun.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1150\n","\n","Link  245 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/8NQKEaS9Zl8\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/8NQKEaS9Zl8\n","[youtube] 8NQKEaS9Zl8: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 8NQKEaS9Zl8: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 12.05MiB in 03:22\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Enzymes also called the bio catalyst that speeds up the rate of reactions, chemical reactions inside your body. Now you must have learned a lot about enzymes, about its structure, how it functions, how it increases the rate of chemical reactions. But in this video, we are going to learn about enzyme names. So before we proceed, I want you to pause the video and write few enzyme names on a paper, at least two or three of them. Alright, now I want you to carefully look at the words that you wrote. Do you see an ASE suffix at the end of each word you wrote? Let me write few examples for you. Lactase Urease Alcohol dehydrogenase Amylase Now look at the words carefully. Do you see an ASE at the end of each word? Now when did this kind of naming system start? Well, it all started with the first enzyme that was discovered which was diastase. And to honor the scientist who first discovered the enzyme, all subsequent enzymes were named by using an ASE as a suffix. And the easiest and most popular way of doing it was to put an ASE at the end of the substrate name. Let's take the example of urease, okay, which converts urea into ammonia and carbon dioxide. Now do you see how this urease name is derived? Just by using an ASE after the substrate name, right? But the problem with this kind of name was that it didn't speak anything about the reaction it is catalyzing. Well, we do understand that it must be acting on urea, but nothing more than that. Just by looking at the name, can you tell that urease actually hydrolyzes, does hydrolysis of urea in order to form ammonia and carbon dioxide. We will not be able to tell that, right? Now apart from putting an ASE at the end of the substrate, scientists were seen to put an ASE at the end of any kind of word that they felt was correct. For example, bernese. Now what do we understand by bernese? Like neither does it talk about the substrate nor about the reaction it is catalyzing. By bern, we understand an outhouse, right? And bernese definitely do not hydrolyze or burn. So gradually, scientists started naming enzymes with a hint of the reaction it was catalyzing. For example, glucose oxidase. Now here the substrate name is very clear and the reaction is again very clear. It is an enzyme that does the oxidation of glucose, right? Now this was all happening somewhere around 1950s when a lot of new discoveries of enzymes were taking place. And the worst part was there was no specific rule as to how to name the enzyme. And all the scientists all over the world came up with names which they thought was best. Which created a lot of confusion and chaos. And scientists felt the need for some kind of method to classify and name enzymes. And that is when a group of scientists approached the international union of biochemistry. And it is this year that the science of biochemistry is being used. And it is this union that finally established the international commission on enzymes to tackle the problem. And this commission finally classified all the enzymes that were discovered till then into six different classes. And here are the six classes. Oxido reductases, transferases, hydrolases, liases, isomerases and ligases. Now let's talk about each of them in detail. First is the oxidoreductase. Now you can see that I have written this name in two separate colors just to specify that it actually catalyzes two different chemical reactions. One is oxidation and the other is reduction. It is quite prominent even from the name, right? Now what do we understand by oxidation? It can be either a gain of oxygen, a loss of electron or a loss of hydrogen, right? And the opposite is true for reduction. By reduction we mean loss of oxygen, a gain of electron or a gain of hydrogen. Right? And when an enzyme does any of these things in a chemical reaction, it is categorized under oxidoreductases. It is called oxidases, reductases or dehydrogenases because it also removes hydrogen, right? Now let's look at an example. An example of lactic acid fermentation. Here lactate is getting converted to pyruvate or pyruvate can be converted to lactate. It's a reversible reaction. Now I want you to carefully look at this part of the lactate molecule which has one alcohol group attached to the carbon and an additional hydrogen. Now this lactate gives away both its hydrogen and forms a double bond with the oxygen molecule. And the molecule that finally forms is called the pyruvate. Okay? Now who does it give away both these hydrogen molecules to? It gives it away to NAD which is a cofactor or electron carrier. Now don't worry, we don't need to know about all of these in detail right now. But what's important for us to understand is that lactate here is getting oxidized by giving away both its hydrogen and its carbon. So the enzyme here which is lactate dehydrogenase is grouped under oxidoreductases. So we can summarize that oxidoreductases are enzyme that does oxidation and reduction reactions and also gives away both its hydrogen and its carbon. So the enzyme here which is lactate dehydrogenase is grouped under oxidoreductases. So we can summarize that oxidoreductases are enzyme that does oxidation and reduction reactions and we learned that an example is lactate dehydrogenase. Right? Now let's move on to the second class of enzyme which is transferase. Lactate dehydrogenase is a group of enzymes that transfers functional group. Okay? But functional group except for hydrogen. Let's look at an example. Here we have an alanine and alpha-ketoglutarate. Now alanine transfers its amine group to alpha-ketoglutarate. So alanine becomes pyruvate and alpha-ketoglutarate with its amine group becomes glutamate. And this reaction is catalyzed by alanine transaminase. Transaminase because it is transferring in amine group. So we got an example of transferases which is alanine transaminase. Okay now the third class of enzyme which is hydrolysis. And the name speaks for itself. Hydrolysis houses enzymes that does hydrolysis reaction which means breaking down of a molecule in the presence of water. Let's look at an example now. So here I have pyrophosphate molecule which in the presence of water is broken down into two phosphate molecule. And the enzyme that is catalyzing it is called pyrophosphatase. So an example of hydrolyse would be pyrophosphatase. And not just pyrophosphatase there are abundance of hydrolyses in the biological system. Any enzyme that breaks down a peptide bond we call them peptidases. If it breaks down the ester bond in lipids we call them the lipases. And if it is breaking down the glycosidic bond in amylose we call them amylases. And all those comes under the hydrolysis class of enzymes. Okay now let's move on to the fourth class of enzyme which is lyases. Any group of enzyme that has the capacity to remove a group from its substrate without hydrolysis or oxidation we group them under the lyase class of enzymes. Let's look at an example now. So here is a pyruvate which loses its carbon and two oxygen forming acetaldehyde and carbon dioxide. And this reaction is catalyzed by pyruvate decarboxylase. Decarboxylase because a carbon dioxide is removed from pyruvate. If it would have removed water we would call it dehydrates. Or if it would have removed an ammonia we would call it deaminase. So we can write an example of lyase would be pyruvate decarboxylase. Moving ahead to the fifth class which is isomerases. Now what do we understand by isomers? Isomers are the molecules whose molecular formula is same but their geometric arrangement is different. For example here is a structure of 2-butene and this also is 2-butene. But here the methyl group are on the same side together but here it is on the opposite side. This is called the cis arrangement. This is called the trans arrangement. And apart from cis and trans arrangement isomers can also be of other types. For example here we have alanine that has an amine group on its left and after rearrangement it now sits on the right. Now both of them have the same molecular formula but as their functional group is rearranged or as their geometric structure is rearranged they now have different chemical and physical properties. Now the enzyme that does all this rearrangement of atoms in order to form isomers are classified under isomerases. And here we got an example alanine resumase. Okay now it's time to move to the sixth class which is ligase. Enzymes classified under ligases links or binds two molecules with the help of ATP. You must have heard of DNA ligase, the enzyme that ligates to DNA strands. Okay let's look at another example. Here we have two groups glutamate and the amine group. And these two groups are combined by a ligase enzyme which in this case is glutamine synthetase. And this enzyme with the help of ATP joins the amine group to the glutamate group thus forming glutamine. Okay so in this video we have learnt about six different classes of enzymes. Now I feel the best way to study enzyme is to study chemical reaction that goes on in living cells. Especially the Krebs cycle or glycolysis which is there in your syllabus. So when you study those pause at each step. Look carefully at what the enzyme is doing at that step. Is it oxidizing, hydrolyzing, ligating something and then try to place them under these classes. That way when you understand enzymes those difficult and boring chain of chemical reactions of biology will turn into something easy and fun to grasp for you.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1652\n","\n","Link  246 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/i9i5i1Xnemw\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/i9i5i1Xnemw\n","[youtube] i9i5i1Xnemw: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] i9i5i1Xnemw: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 5.92MiB in 02:28\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Humanity is entering some type of new phase. Even something as light as YouTube, when you really think about it, it's gonna go down in history with writing the printing press as a new phase. But at the same time, the current form of education is about 200 years old. Education is something that we just assume because we all grew up in it. Let's reimagine education. Let's imagine what schooling could and should look like, given the needs of the future and also the tools at our disposal. With the internet, we can literally connect the world through learning. I think I've always been drawn to science fiction because it really does challenge you to think, how could the world be? When the whole Khan Academy thing started to happen, I think one of the unique things that, to some degree, allowed me and Khan Academy to have our own lane is that we started having more of this almost science fiction view. Hey, instead of Khan Academy just being a piece of software, a piece of content, could it be the next Oxford, the next Smithsonian? Could it help us elevate to another level so that the time we live in now feels like a dark ages in 100 years or 200 years? My name is Sal Khan, and I'm the founder and CEO of both Khan Academy and Schoolhouse.World. Take a moment and remember your favorite teacher. Now imagine that teacher could reach not 30 kids in a classroom, but millions of students all over the world. That's exactly what Sal Khan is doing on his website, Khan Academy. Back in 2004, my family was visiting me in Boston, and my aunt told me that my cousin was having trouble in math. And when I asked Nadia what was going on, Nadia said, I'm just not a math person. When someone says I'm not good at math, I immediately think they just haven't looked at it the right way or their self-esteem has been shot because either they themselves have been telling themselves or other people have been telling them that they're not good at it. And what I've seen over and over again, it has nothing to do with inatability. So for the next several months, Nadia was in New Orleans, I was in Boston remotely tutoring her, and I had five virtual classrooms, which were essentially these digital scratch pads. I could tell Nadia, meet me in classroom five. And what that meant is I could be in Boston, she was in New Orleans, but at classroom five, we would hear each other's voices, and if one of us wrote with a digital pen, the other one would see it. We started making progress, she got caught up with her class, she frankly got a little ahead of her class. And by quirk of how my mind works, I am always thinking, hey, this is working for my cousins, could it work for 10 cousins? Hey, if it's working for them, could it work for people who aren't my cousins? Could it work for 10 million people? Could it work for a billion people? So in 2009, I quit my day job. I set it up as a not-for-profit with the mission of free world-class education for anyone, anywhere. A little delusional for a guy operating out of a walk-in closet at the time. And so in that early version of Khan Academy, I was imagining it would be a place where we can connect as human beings and learn from each other. Now, as Khan Academy grew, and now it's 120 million registered users, 20, 30 million come every month all over the world, we lost that person-to-person functionality, but it's always been in the back of my mind. And that's where Schoolhouse.World comes into the picture. The pandemic hits, and Khan Academy's traffic goes to the roof. We've always known, well before the pandemic, that small group tutoring is really the gold standard. There's actually a lot of research papers that even small group tutoring by someone who learned the same material last semester or last year can actually be highly effective, and in some cases, even more effective. And so I started reaching out to some friends and said, couldn't we build a prototype of a platform where folks who need help in a topic could say they need help, and that other people, high-quality, vetted tutors could say, yes, I could run a small group tutoring session on that topic. And by the end of the summer, it was working. We were getting amazing stories. 13- and 14-year-olds helping people who are in their 50s try to get their high school diploma. We're seeing people in very disparate conditions economic strata, life stages, cultures, being able to connect and empathize with each other around meaningful work that matters for both of them. We were seeing that it is actually possible to scale up tutoring by leveraging people's willingness to do good for others. When Schoolhouse.World started, I thought the game-changing aspect of it would be that we have figured out a way to scale high-quality tutoring. But I actually think the real game-changer is when we're able to connect with other human beings, when that other human being genuinely says, thank you, you just changed my life, you just unlocked my mind, I will never forget what you just did. What do you think education will look like in a thousand years? I like to think on multiple scales. So, you know, to answer your question, a thousand years? I don't know, you know, with CRISPR and genetic engineering, we might be able to download knowledge, take a pill, who knows? We'll be in some virtual reality, assuming humanity keeps progressing. But I think over the next, let's call it 30 to 50 years, I think we're going to have a world where anyone on the planet is going to have access to all the core academic material and non-academic material they need to be a fully actualized person.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1018\n","\n","Link  247 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/9ebG56arooU\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ebG56arooU\n","[youtube] 9ebG56arooU: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 9ebG56arooU: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 2.40MiB in 00:29\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  पेले शहर ऐसा नहीं था। पर अब प्रेशर कुकर बन गया है। पटना ही था एक दिन। मैं साज पिदी कुटा। और इंडिया टॉप टेन में आना है मुझे। किसी एक इंस्टिटिटॉट में रांग फॉर्टी थर्ड नहीं। तुमें गर की याद नहीं आती उठिक? गर भी कोई याद करने की चीज़ है और तुम सबके होते होए। परसे मेरे बोड़े हैं। एकी तो उंडरेइटिन बची थे यार हमारे गुप में। तुमें परले कभी देखा नहीं है। अपने सिरी प्राज तिनोर खुद़्स आえる आपके � एक ल başka वमcious हाम सकता हैं। सब स przede महत्र लुज् 최근ने किर जाजतों करें तो plane pamięा zwischen ज़ाज इसfy सबमोर्ड प्ररिर्द glowingे सकता हँ। तौपपर का गेम है ये? तौपपर का गेम! बेसिक निचर थरमल स्टाबिलाडि शुर्विट इं वौटर राजाव अनेल्जी पहला सूल है, जो दिकता है वो विकता है जिंदल हमारा राइवल है पापा अकले सार मुझे टॉब टेन रेंग्स चाही है एट एनी कौस्त। और खाने में क्या लब? पूरा पस्यार लेआ इस्टिवर का पेपर तक तू ख्लियर नहीं कर पाया, आईटी तू क्या था? हाब आइटी तू क्या करेगा? अब आ kaya परस्ट को जोस्धार का पराइजी। क्या है? ह 2019 । इनिuler � kommer आप crack.

A ball you throw in the air. An apple that drops from a tree. Even you when you're on a trampoline at someone's awesome birthday party. But why? My friends, let me introduce you to one of the most wonderful forces in the universe. It's one we're all experiencing right now without even trying. Fasten your seatbelts because we're going to explore the power of gravity. Gravity If I told you that you just won the lottery, what would you do? If you're like me, you'd jump up and down and scream. And after you were done freaking out and jumping in the air, you'd land on your feet, right? But why would you land back on the ground instead of just floating off into space? It's because of a little something we call gravity. Gravity is what pulls everything toward the ground, including you. Without the force of gravity, there would be no life on Earth. Air, water, animals, everything would fly off into space. There'd be no you, no me, no french fries, nada. Think of gravity like the invisible superglue that holds our massive world together. You can't see it, but it's always there. An English scientist named Isaac Newton was the first person to seriously study gravity over 300 years ago. There's a famous story about him that you might have heard. Supposedly, Sir Isaac was hanging out underneath an apple tree thinking, probably partly napping, when an apple fell from the tree and conked him on the head. That's when Sir Isaac had an aha moment. Why did the apple fall down to the ground and not up or sideways? He realized that a special kind of force, which we now know as gravity, was acting on all of the objects on Earth, pulling them toward it. Once the apple became too heavy for its stem to hold it anymore, the gravitational pull of Earth brought the apple down onto Newton's noggin. Newton also realized it doesn't matter how heavy an object is either, whether you're holding an apple or a bowling ball or a feather. If you let go of it, that sucker's going down. We're gonna make a whole video about this later. Basically, he determined that what goes up must come down. Sir Isaac was a pretty smart dude. Okay, so you know that if you jump up, you'll eventually land back on the ground, and you know that an apple dropped down will land on the ground too. But what if you throw something in front of you or to the left or the right? To see how gravity will act, pick up the tennis ball or any small round object and hold it in your hand. Let's toss it in the air and watch it fall to the ground. No surprise here. Okay, now pick it up and hold it over your head. Let go and watch it fall once more. Again, not a shocker. Now throw it to your left. Ball down. Pitch it to the right and watch it go down again. No matter where you throw the ball, it's going down. So we've determined that near the surface of the Earth, where we all are, gravity is the cause that produces the effect of all unsupported objects falling down. The ball will go up or to the left or to the right for a little bit, but eventually it's going to be pulled back down to the ground no matter what. Gravity has got to hold on, well, everything. So eventually everything that you can think of can be thrown up into the air and will come back down even if you throw it to the left or the right or any other direction. That's gravity doing its thing. But when you really think about it, which way is down exactly? I mean, the Earth is round and there are all kinds of things on what we think of as the bottom of the Earth. So how does gravity keep them from falling off? I know a penguin who can answer that question. So you know that the Earth is round and you know that gravity is the force that pulls objects down. But if the Earth is round and there's stuff at the bottom of the Earth, say a penguin in Antarctica, why doesn't gravity pull the penguin down off of the Earth? I mean, does gravity really pull down? When we talk about gravity and we say things like up or down, we don't mean those things in the sense that you're used to. In this case, up just means away from the Earth and down means toward it. So when you hear people say gravity pulls things down to Earth, they really mean that gravity pulls things toward the Earth. Now think of it this way, gravity is the force of attraction between any two objects made of matter, right? Well, I have news for you. You're made of matter and so is the Earth. That means you and the Earth have an attraction to each other. Aww, you guys! Anyway, the scientific argument for gravity is that any object that's on or close to Earth's surface and is made of less matter than Earth will be pulled in by our planet's stronger gravitational pull. Wanna do a little demonstration? To show how Earth is made of matter, we need to know how gravity pulls objects down. To show how Earth's gravity can pull an object, like the penguin we mentioned before, toward it, no matter where on Earth that penguin is, all you need is a tennis ball and a rubber band. Oh, and your index finger. Now let's pretend the tennis ball is Earth and the rubber band represents the force of gravity. That makes your finger our adorable little penguin just chilling on the surface of the Earth. Now stretch the rubber band around your tennis ball Earth and stick your finger under the rubber band. Now try to lightly pull your finger away from the ball. The penguin is trying to jump off the Earth, even though penguins can't fly! What are you doing, penguin?! But what happens? Not much. Your finger doesn't get far before the rubber band pulls it back toward the ball, right? And the effect is the same no matter where your finger penguin is on your Earth ball. Whether it's at the top or the side or on the very bottom, the same thing happens. The penguin is forced back to Earth no matter how hard it tries to jump off. So what does this mean? It means that no matter where on Earth an object is, the planet's gravitational pull will draw the object toward it. And that's how you should think about gravity. It's the force that pulls things toward Earth. So basically, we have gravity to thank for the fact that penguins stick to the bottom of the Earth. And I, for one, am grateful. I like penguins. Interesting, huh? When we say that gravity pulls down, what we really mean is that it pulls everything towards the center of the Earth. But what if I want to take a break from the Earth? What if I'm an astronaut and I want to take a vacation on the Moon? How can I possibly escape the gravity of the Earth? And if I can, what will happen as I get closer to the Moon? I guess there's only one way to find out. You know how many people have actually been on the Moon? Twelve. That's all. But one day, we may go back there. We have a lot more to learn about the Moon and space in general. So someday, maybe in your lifetime, we'll send astronauts out there to study and explore. Do you want to be one of them? If you do, let me give you some helpful tips about a little thing called gravity. Because you're going to need to know all about what gravity is and how it works if you're going to escape the pull of Earth and fly to the Moon. Now, you already know that astronauts can leave the Earth. But it takes a lot of effort to boldly go where few have gone before. But once astronauts reach the speed called escape velocity, they're able to overcome the force of Earth's gravity and get into orbit around our planet. Or head on over to the Moon. So this brings up an interesting question. What happens when an object gets away from Earth's gravity, but close to the Moon's gravity? You already know that gravity is the force that keeps us from flying off the surface of the Earth. And you know that gravity pulls things not down, but towards the Earth's center. You also know that gravity exists between any objects that have mass. And the greater an object's mass is, the greater the effect of its gravity, or pull, on other objects is. But there's something more. Remember Isaac Newton, the apple tree guy? He determined that the amount of gravitational force, or pull, between two objects also depends on how far apart they are. So the farther away something is from the Earth, the less it will feel the pull of Earth's gravity. And the closer it gets to the Moon, the more it will feel the Moon's gravity pulling on it. Let's do a little pretending to see what happens to something when it moves closer to an object that has a really large mass, and therefore a really strong pull of gravity. If you've ever made a wish on a shooting star, you've seen the effect of Earth's gravity pulling on an object. Shooting stars, which are actually meteors, occur when pieces of rock break off from a passing comet or asteroid and get too close to the Earth. For example, say this globe represents the Earth, and the marble represents a piece of space rock that's flying by. You can see that there's a huge difference in size between the two objects, and if we were to put them on a scale, we'd see that there's a big difference in their mass too. Our model Earth has a larger mass. If the space rock is far away from the Earth, then it can go on its merry way, since it won't be affected by the Earth's gravity. But if it gets too close, then it and the Earth engage in a bit of tug-of-war, since both have gravity they pull on one another. It's not much of a fight, though. The more massive Earth has a much larger gravitational pull, so the rock gets caught in Earth's gravity, and most of the time, it gives us a brilliant streak of light we call a meteor. But what does this mean for our space travelers? Well, when an astronaut ship takes off for the Moon and moves away from the Earth, the farther from Earth it goes, the less it feels the pull of Earth's gravity. And, as it gets closer to the Moon, the spaceship begins to feel the tug-of-the-Moon's gravity more. So, even though the Moon has a smaller mass than the Earth, and has less of a pull on the ship than the Earth does, once the ship gets closer to the Moon than the Earth, the Moon's gravity pulls the ship toward it. And then the astronauts can make a safe landing! So we can make the argument that two things affect the pull of gravity. First, the size of the object. Objects with a bigger mass have a stronger pull of gravity. And second, the distance between objects. The farther apart objects are, the weaker the pull of gravity between them, and the closer together they are, the stronger the pull of gravity. All of this means that when the day comes that you're flying a spaceship to the Moon, you just have to escape Earth's gravity, and then get close enough to the Moon to enter its gravity. Remember that when you're grown up, and you're welcome. If you want to thank me, you could just name a crater or something after me when you get there. So, here's what we know so far. Whether on Earth or in space, anything that has mass will exert the force of gravity. And on Earth, everything falls towards the middle of the Earth at the same rate. But hold up a sec. You've probably noticed that if you drop a piece of paper or a feather, it takes longer to reach the ground than something like a rock or a ball. So what's up with that? It's time to investigate. I don't care who you are. If you live anywhere near this planet, then you're no stranger to gravity. The force that affects every object on Earth and beyond. Because of gravity, whether you're an astronaut on the International Space Station, or an ordinary, clumsy, Earth-bound human who happens to drop her books a lot, all things caught in our planet's gravity will, in some way, have the potential to fall to Earth. But objects fall differently, right? Like, when I knock a piece of paper off my desk, it takes a lot longer to fall to the ground than if I knock a book off my desk. So what's up with that? Why do things seem to fall at different speeds on Earth? Well, we already know that all objects have mass. They have a certain amount of matter in them. And when gravity pulls on an object, it gives the object weight. Now, a long time ago, people used to think that heavier things fell faster than lighter things, because that's what our senses told us. I mean, it certainly looks like the book falls faster than the piece of paper. And why would we expect anything else? That would be like dropping a hammer and a feather and expecting them to hit the ground at the same time. Except, the thing I just said about the hammer and the feather? Someone did actually try that, and they did both hit the ground at the same time. It just didn't happen on Earth. True story, when astronaut Dave Scott was on the moon in 1971, he did an experiment, where he dropped a falcon feather and a hammer from the same height, and they hit the ground at the same time. Now, how can that be? If you drop a hammer and a feather on Earth, the feather would take a lot longer to reach the ground. So, what does the Earth have that the moon doesn't? For one thing, an atmosphere. The gases that make up Earth's atmosphere push against objects as they fall. And the push of the air against the falling object causes friction. We call that friction air resistance. So on Earth, the feather's flat, fluffy shape makes it run into more air resistance than the hammer does. This makes it fall more slowly than the hammer. But since the moon has almost no atmosphere, there's almost no air resistance, so the two objects fell at the same rate. So it seems to me that it's the resistance of air pushing against objects that really affects how fast objects fall. And that means that it's experiment time. [♪ INTRO & MUSIC PLAYING But you don't have to go to the moon to do this, so don't pack your bags or anything. All you need are two pieces of paper that are the same size. Crumble one of the pieces into a tight ball and leave the other one smooth and flat. Now drop each piece of paper from the same height, let's say a meter, and then write down in a table how long it takes each piece to reach the ground. You'll see it takes the flat paper longer than the crumpled paper to hit the floor. This is evidence that an object's shape affects how fast it seems to fall to Earth, because the two pieces of paper are exactly the same, they have the same mass. But air resistance makes the flat paper seem to fall more slowly than the crumpled paper. [♪ INTRO & MUSIC PLAYING So, based on the results of our experiment, we can say, at least here on Earth, objects appear to fall at different rates, not because they have different masses or weights, but because of air resistance, the force that the Earth's atmosphere has on objects as they fall. So there you have it. Gravity is the force that's exerted by everything that has mass, and it's felt by everything equally, even though falling objects on Earth might not always look like that's the case. I mean, if you don't believe me, you can go to the moon and do the old hammer and feather experiment for yourself. Or you can just trust me.

Where Europe, the Prime Meridian, runs through us, we're in the middle of every map, and we get to be a continent even though we're not a continent. But let's begin today with a pop quiz. What was the best year of your life, and what was the worst year? Mr. Green, Mr. Green, best 1994, worst 1990. Oh, me from the past. It gets so much better, and also so much worse. For worst year, I'm going to go with 2001, best year 2006. Alright, now it's your turn, dear pupil. Share your best and worst years in comments during the intro. INTRO Right, so what you'll quickly find is that your worst year was someone else's best year. So too with history. The period between 600 and 1450 CE is often called the Middle Ages in Europe because it came between the Roman Empire, assuming you forget about the Byzantines, and the beginning of the Modern Age. And it's sometimes called the Dark Ages because it was so purportedly unenlightened, but was the age really so dark? Depends on what you find depressing. If you like cities and great poetry, then the Dark Ages were indeed pretty dark in Europe. But if, like me, your two favorite things are not dying from wars and not dying from anything else, then the Dark Ages actually weren't that bad, at least until the plague came in the 14th century. And meanwhile, outside of Europe, the Dark Ages were truly an age of enlightenment. But we'll get boring Europe out of the way first. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. Medieval Europe had less trade, fewer cities, and less cultural output than the original Roman Empire. London and Paris were fetid fire traps with none of the planning or sewage management of places 5,000 years older, like Mahenjo-daro in the Indus Valley civilization, let alone Rome. And in powerful governments, wars were at least smaller, which is one reason why Europeans living in medieval times... Ugh, Thought Bubble, I knew you were going to do that! Anyway, people in medieval times lived slightly longer, life expectancy was 30, than Europeans during the Roman Empire, when life expectancy was 28. Instead of centralized governments, Europe in the Middle Ages had feudalism, a political system based on reciprocal relationships between lords, who owned lots of land, and vassals, who protected the land and got to dress up as knights in exchange for pledging loyalty to the lords. The lords were also vassals to more important lords, with the most important of all being the king. Below the knights were peasants, who did the actual work on the land in exchange for protection from bandits and other threats. Feudalism was also an economic system, with the peasants working the land and keeping some of their production to feed themselves, while giving the rest to the landowner whose land they worked. The small-scale local nature of the feudal system was perfect for a time and place where the threats to people's safety were also small-scale and local. But of course, this system reinforces the status quo, there's little freedom and absolutely no social mobility. Peasants could never work their way up to lords, and they almost never left their villages. Thanks Thought Bubble. One more point that's really interesting from a world history perspective, this devolution from empire to localism has happened in lots of places at lots of different times. And in times of extreme political stress, like after the fall of the Han Dynasty in China, power tends to flow into the hands of local lords who can protect the peasants better than the state can. We hear a lot about this in Chinese history, and also in contemporary Afghanistan, but instead of being called feudal lords, these landlords are called war lords. Eurocentrism striking again. The other reason the Dark Ages are called dark is because Europe was dominated by superstition and by boring religious debates about how many angels can fit on the head of a pin. And while there's something to that, the Middle Ages also saw theologians like Thomas Aquinas, who was quite an important philosopher, and women like Hildegard of Bingen, who wrote all this important liturgical music and also basically invented the genre of the morality play. All that noted, things were certainly brighter in the Islamic world, or Dar al-Islam. So when we last left the Muslims, they had expanded out of their homeland in Arabia and conquered the rich Egyptian provinces of the Byzantines and the entire Sasanian Empire, all in the space of about a hundred years. The Umayyad dynasty then expanded the empire west to Spain and moved the capital to Damascus, because it was closer to the action empire-wise, but still technically in Arabia. That was really important to the Umayyads, because they'd established this hierarchy with the Arabs like them at the top, and in fact they tried to keep Arabs from fraternizing with non-Arab Muslims throughout the empire. This of course annoyed the non-Arab Muslims, who were like, I don't know if you're reading the same Quran we are, but this one says that we're all supposed to be equal. And pretty quickly a majority of Muslims weren't Arabs, which made it pretty easy for them to overthrow the Umayyads, which they did in 750 CE. Their replacements, the Abbasids. Abbasids, hold on. Abbasid or Abbasid? Ah, right, twice! Right, so the Abbasids were from the Abassi, or Abassi family, which hailed from one of the eastern and therefore more Persian provinces of the Islamic Empire. The Abbasids took over in 750, and no one could fully defeat them until 1258, when they were conquered by, wait for it, the Mongols. The Abbasids kept the idea of a hereditary monarchy, but they moved the capital of the empire to Baghdad, and they were much more welcoming of non-Arab Muslims into positions of power. And under the Abbasids, the Dar al-Islam took on a distinctly Persian cast that it never really lost. The Caliph now styled himself as a king of kings, just like the Achaemenids had, and pretty soon the Caliph's rule was a lot more indirect, just like the original Persians. This meant that his control was much weaker, and by about 1000 CE, the Islamic Caliphate, which looked so incredibly impressive on a map, had really descended into a series of smaller kingdoms, each paying lip service to the Caliph in Baghdad. This was partly because the Islamic Empire relied more and more on soldiers from the frontier, in this case the Turks, and also slaves pressed into military service in order to be the backbone of their army, a strategy that has been tried over and over again and has worked exactly zero times, which you should remember if you ever become an emperor. Actually, our resident historian points out that that strategy has worked, if you are the Mongols. More important than the Persian-style monarchy that the Abbasids set up was their openness to foreigners and their ideas. That tolerance and curiosity ushered in a golden age of Islamic learning centered in Baghdad. The Abbasids oversaw an effervescence of culture unlike anything that had been seen since Hellenistic times. Arabic replaced Greek not only as the language of commerce and religion, but also of culture, philosophy, medicine, and poetry were all written in Arabic, although Persian remained an important literary language. And Baghdad became the world's center of scholarship, with its house of wisdom and immense library. Muslim scholars translated the works of Greek philosophers, including Aristotle and Plato, as well as scientific works by Hippocrates, Archimedes, and especially the physician Galen. And they translated and preserved Buddhist and Hindu manuscripts that might otherwise have been lost. Muslims made huge strides in medicine as well. One Muslim scholar, Ibn Sina, wrote the Canon of Medicine, which became the standard medical textbook for centuries in both Europe and the Middle East. And the Islamic Empire adopted mathematical concepts from India, such as the zero, a number so fascinating and beautiful that we could write an entire episode about it, but instead I'm just going to write it a little love poem. Oh zero, pretty little zero, they say you're nothing, but you mean everything to mathematical history and me. Oh, it's time for the open letter? An open letter to science and religion. But first, let's see what's in the secret compartment today. Oh, champagne poppers? What am I supposed to do with these? Under science and religion, you're supposed to be so irreconcilable and everything, but not so much in the Abbasid Empire. I mean, Muslim mathematicians expanded math to such a degree that we now call the base ten number system and the symbols we use to denote it Arabic numerals. And religion was at least part of what pushed all that learning forward. Like the great philosopher Ibn Rushd argued that the only path to religious enlightenment was through Aristotelian reasoning. And Muslim mathematicians and astronomers developed algebra partly so they could simplify Islamic inheritance law. Plus, they made important strides in trigonometry to help people understand where to turn when trying to turn toward Mecca. You were working so well together, science and religion, but then, like Al and Tip or Gore, just couldn't last forever. Nothing gold can stay in this world. Nothing gold can stay. Best wishes, John Green. Baghdad wasn't the only center of learning in the Islamic world. In Spain, Islamic Cordova became a center for the arts, especially architecture. This is perhaps best exemplified by the great mosque at Cordova, built by the Umayyad ruler Abd al-Rathman I in 785 to 786 CE. That's right, this building, still standing today and one of the most amazing mosques in the world, was built in a year, whereas medieval cathedrals took like a million years to finish. The Muslims of Spain were also engineers who rivaled the Romans. Aqueducts in Cordova brought drinkable water into the city, and Muslim scholars took the lead in agricultural science, improving yields on all kinds of new crops, allowing Spanish lives to be longer and less hungry. Everybody wanted to live in Spain. Even the greatest Jewish philosopher Maimonides wanted to live in Spain, but sadly he was expelled and ended up in Alexandria, Egypt. There he wrote his awesomely titled Defensive Rationality, A Guide for the Perplexed. I'm translating the title, of course, because the original text was written in Arabic. Meanwhile, China was having a golden age of its own. The Tang dynasty made China's government more of a meritocracy and ruled over 80 million people across four million square miles. And they might have conquered all of Central Asia had it not been for the Abbasids, whom they fought at the most important battle you've never heard of, the Battle of the Talis River. This was like the Ali-Frasier of the 8th century, and the Abbasids won, which ended up defining who had cultural influence where, with the Abbasids dominating to the west of the river and China dominating to the east. The Tang also produced incredible art that was traded all throughout Asia. And many of the more famous sculptures from the Tang dynasty feature figures who are distinctly not Chinese, which again demonstrates the diversity of the empire. The Tang was also a golden age for Chinese poetry, with notables like Du Fu and Li Ba applying their craft, encouraged by the official government. And the Song dynasty, which lasted from 960 to 1258, kicked even more ass, it's not cursing if you're talking about donkeys. By the 11th century, Chinese metalworkers were producing as much iron as Europe would be able to produce in the 18th century. Some of this iron was put to use in new plows, which enabled agriculture to boom, thereby supporting population growth. Porcelain was of such high quality that it was shipped throughout the world, which is why we now call it China. And there was so much trade going on that the Chinese ran out of metal for coins, leading to another innovation, paper money. And by the 11th century, the Chinese were writing down their recipe for a mixture of salt, Peter, sulfur, and charcoal that we now know as gunpowder. That becomes kind of a big deal in history, paving the way as it does for modern warfare and arena rock pyrotechnics and oh, that's why! Not so dark after all. Thanks for watching.

Those times that you said that thing that you know you shouldn't have said, or even that thing you didn't even know you were gonna say. The little cogs of your consciousness cranking away, making your life possible, making society function, all of the things that you're so glad you can do, and all the ones you wish you could stop doing. Excluding other human minds, your mind is the most complicated piece of the universe that humans currently know about. The rules that govern it are mysterious and elusive. Maybe our brains just aren't complex enough to understand themselves, but that's not gonna stop us from trying. The word psychology comes from the Latin for the study of the soul. And while its formal definition has evolved over the last several decades, today we can safely call it the science of behavior and mental processes. The term psychology wasn't coined until around the turn of the 16th century, and a practice that we would actually call science today wasn't established until the mid-1800s. But of course, humans have always been curious about themselves and what's going on up here. Aristotle pondered the seed of human consciousness and decided that it was in the heart, not the head, being, as we have seen quite a lot here on Crash Course, absolutely and completely wrong. Two thousand years ago, Chinese rulers conducted the world's first psychological exams, requiring public officials to take personality and intelligence tests. And in the late 800s, Persian doctor Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi, also known as Razi's, was one of the first to describe mental illness, and even treated patients, in what was essentially a very early psych ward in his Baghdad hospital. From the efforts of those early thinkers up until today, the field of psychology has been all about tackling some of the big questions. How can humans do horrible things like commit genocide and torture other humans, and how come we know those things are horrible? Do we have free will, or are we simply driven by our environment, biology, and non-conscious influences? What is mental illness, and what can we do about it? And what is consciousness, or the notion of self? If I lose my awareness of myself, am I still human? I don't know! But over the next six months, these are the questions that we're going to be exploring together. How our brains work, how they can break, how they can be healed, why we behave the way we do, even when we don't want to, and what it means to be thinking and feeling and alive.

Yeah, yeah, big ask, Mr. Green. I mean, that fight goes back thousands and thousands of years. Except, thousands of years ago, there wasn't an Islam yet. So yeah, no. Also, let me submit that very little of this conflict between Israel and Palestine over the last several decades has been about, like, theological differences between Islam and Judaism. No one's arguing about whether the most important prophets descended from Abraham's son Isaac or his son Ishmael, right? It's not about whether to fast during Yom Kippur or Ramadan. It's about land. Portraying the conflict as eternal or as religious makes it feel intractable in a way that, frankly, it isn't. So instead, let's begin as most historians do in the late 19th century. And instead of talking about religion, let's follow the lead of historians like James Galvin and discuss competing nationalisms. INTRO Okay, so in the late 19th century, the Ottoman Empire ruled over what we now know as Palestine. The population there, according to Ottoman records from 1878, was 87% Muslim, 10% Christian, and 3% Jewish. Everybody spoke Arabic as the daily language, and in Jerusalem, the religious populations were roughly equal. To give you a sense of life in Ottoman Palestine, an Arab Orthodox Christian musician named Wasif Jahariya grew up in Jerusalem in the first decade of the 20th century, learning the Quran in school and celebrating both Passover and Eid with his Jewish and Muslim neighbors. Ottoman Palestine was, in short, a place in which people of different religious faiths lived peacefully together. Alright, let's go to the thought ball. The late 19th century was the golden age of nationalism in Europe, and no place was crazier than the Habsburg-Austral-Hungarian Empire, in which at least 10 different nations all wanted their own state. And in that hypernationalistic empire lived a Jewish journalist named Theodor Herzl, who had hoped that Jews could assimilate into European nations, but soon became convinced that the Jewish people needed to leave Europe and settle in their own state. The concept of Jewish nationalism came to be known as Zionism. It's important to keep in mind that most Zionists were secular Jews, so they imagined Israel as a state for Jews more than a Jewish state. In 1917, the British government, hoping to gain the support of Jewish people, issued the Balfour Declaration, promising, quote, the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, a bold promise considering that Palestine was still technically Ottoman as they hadn't yet lost World War I. Of course they would soon, but it turned out that the British were over-promisers when it came to Palestine, because a year before the Balfour Declaration, the British had secretly promised the French that they would divide up the Arab territories and the Brits would keep Palestine. Furthermore, in 1915, other British officials had promised the ruler of Mecca, Sharif Hussein, that he would rule over an Arab state, including Palestine, if he let an Arab revolt against Ottoman rule, which Hussein promptly did. So basically, the Brits had promised Palestine to the Meccans, to themselves, and to the Zionists. What could go wrong? Thanks, Thought Bubble. So shortly after the end of the war, the British established a colony in Palestine with the idea that they'd rule until the Palestinians were ready to govern themselves. At which point the people living in Palestine were like, well, now seems good, and the British were like, yeah, but maybe not just yet. Meanwhile, the British established separate institutions for Christians, Jews, and Muslims, making it difficult for Palestinian Christians and Muslims to cooperate, and easier for the British to, quote, divide and rule the inhabitants of Palestine. Again, what could go wrong? Meanwhile, the British did attempt to honor the Balfour Declaration's promise to, quote, facilitate Jewish immigration under suitable conditions. Between 1920 and 1939, the Jewish population of Palestine increased by over 320,000 people. In fact, by 1938, Jews were just under 30% of the population of Palestine. And the growing Jewish population focused on purchasing land from absentee non-Palestinian Arab landowners, and then evicting Palestinian farmers who were living and working there. By controlling both the land and the labor, they hoped to establish a more secure community within Palestine, but of course these practices heightened tensions between Jewish people and Arab Palestinians during the 1920s and 1930s. Along the way, Palestinian Arabs began to think of themselves as the Palestinian nation, and that growing sense of nationalism erupted in 1936 when the Palestinians revolted against the British. With the help of Jewish militias, the British brutally suppressed the Palestinian revolt, but in the aftermath, the British issued a white paper limiting Jewish immigration to Palestine and calling for the establishment of a joint Arab and Jewish state in Palestine within 10 years. This managed to leave no one happy. The Zionists were angry at Britain for limiting Jewish immigration at a time when Jews particularly needed to leave Europe, and the Arab Palestinians were unhappy about the prospect of waiting 10 years for a state. And then came World War II, which was actually quite a peaceful time in Palestine. But then it ended, and tensions resumed, and the British realized that colonies like Palestine were far more trouble than they were worth, so they handed the issue of Palestine over to the newly created United Nations. They were like, oh hey there, United Nations, for your first problem! So in November of 1947, the United Nations voted to partition Palestine into separate Palestinian and Jewish states. The partition plan called for two states roughly equal in size. But the borders looked like a jigsaw puzzle. I mean, you do not look at this map and think, yeah, that's gonna work. Sure enough it didn't, and soon after the plan was announced, the cleverly named 1948 Arab-Israeli War broke out, with Israel on the one side and the Palestinians and many Arab states on the other. The Israelis won, and when an armistice was signed in 1949, Israel occupied a third more land than they would have had under the UN proposal. Meanwhile, Jordan controlled, and later annexed, the West Bank and the old city of Jerusalem, and Egypt controlled the Gaza Strip. Over 700,000 Palestinians fled their homes and became refugees in the surrounding Arab countries. To Israelis, this war was the beginning of their nation. To the Palestinians, it was the Nabka, the catastrophe, as they became stateless. Over the next 18 years, nothing changed territorially, and then in 1967, Israel and several Arab states went to war again. It was called the Six Days War because, get this, it lasted six days. Israel won and then gained control over the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Sinai Peninsula, and the Golan Heights. So the 1947 proposal looked like this. By 1967, things looked like this. Then the UN passed Resolution 242. Man, they are good at naming resolutions, which outlined a basic framework for achieving peace, including Israel withdrawing from the territory acquired in the war, and all participants recognizing the rights of both a Palestinian and an Israeli state to exist. This, of course, did not happen. After the war, the broader Israeli-Arab conflict morphed into a more specific Israeli-Palestinian conflict. And this is a nice moment to note that not all Muslims are Arabs, not all Arabs are Palestinians, and not all Palestinians are Muslims. Like there's a significant Christian minority of Palestinians, for instance. Palestinian is a word used to describe the ethnic identity of those who have historically lived in Palestine. There were, for instance, lots of Christians in the Palestinian Liberation Organization, or PLO, formed in 1964 and led by Yasser Arafat. The PLO oversaw guerrilla groups that attacked civilians, but also used non-violent approaches to try to achieve a Palestinian state. And meanwhile, the Israeli government began to establish Jewish settlements in what had been Palestinian territory, including East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and the Gaza Strip. There are now over 350,000 Jewish settlers in the West Bank and over 200,000 in East Jerusalem. And these settlements are illegal, according to international law, but Israel counters by saying that they aren't really illegal because Palestine isn't really a state. By the late 1980s, Palestinians launched the first Intifada, which literally means shaking off. And this began with like boycotts of Israeli products and services and refusing to pay Israeli taxes. But when the Israeli armed forces cracked down on protesters, violence ensued. And the first Intifada also saw the founding of Hamas, which launched the first suicide bombing against Israel in 1993. Hamas gained support partly because of its militancy, but mostly because of its social welfare projects in Gaza. It built and staffed schools, mosques, and clinics. The most important legacy of the first Intifada was the emergence of peace talks between Palestinians and Israelis. This led to the Oslo Accords and a peace process based on our old friend United Nations Security Council Resolution 242. But there were a lot of issues to resolve. I mean, putting aside the question of like how to make two states that don't look like a jigsaw puzzle, there was the question of the Jewish settlement and the right for Palestinian refugees and their descendants to return to Palestine, water rights, which are a big deal in that part of the world, and so on. It's very complicated. So then came the Clinton talk. So it's time for the open letter. But first let's see what's inside of the globe. Look, it's a collection of philandering American presidents. An open letter to Bill Clinton. Hey Bill, so your talks probably came closer than any other time in recent history to an actual peace deal between the Israelis and the Palestinians. Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak was willing to give up more land currently claimed by Israel than at any time in the past. Even Yasser Arafat was surprised. Although not all the questions got addressed, you were definitely closing in on something. But in the end, it didn't happen, and since then, not to criticize you, things have gotten kind of worse and worse and worse. Worst of all, that was your big legacy moment. Now all you've got is the conflict in Northern Ireland getting resolved while you were president. In short, it could have been amazing, but instead it was kind of meh. Kind of like your presidency, actually. At least you always have those vodka soaked hugs with Boris Yeltsin to look back on. Best wishes, John Green. So the Clinton talks failed, Ehud Barak's government was undermined, and then in September of 2000, Prime Minister candidate Ariel Sharon led a group of 1,000 armed guards to the Temple Mount in the old city of Jerusalem. To Muslims, this is known as the Al-Aqsa Mosque, and it's the third holiest site in Islam, behind only the Kaaba in Mecca and the Prophet's Mosque in Medina. And it's the holiest site in Judaism, so in short, it's a pretty touchy place to march to with a thousand armed guards. So the event sparked a massive protest, which eventually led to the much more violent Second Intifada, in which more than 3,000 Palestinians and 1,000 Israelis were eventually killed. In 2002, the Israelis, claiming to act in defense of civilians, began construction of a wall around the West Bank, but instead of following the borders established after the 1967 war, the barrier was built to include many Israeli settlements on the Israeli side. To Israelis, that was about self-defense. To Palestinians, it was an illegal land grab. Then in 2005, Yasser Arafat died, and in an election shortly thereafter, Hamas won a majority of the parliamentary seats. Since then, Hamas and the Palestinian Authority have sort of divided how to govern Palestine, and it's also sort of been poorly governed. In the past ten years, Hamas has frequently launched rocket attacks into Israel. Israel has responded with extended and extremely violent invasions of Palestinian territory that have seen thousands of Palestinians killed, many of them militants, but also many not. Both parties claim to be responding to the provocations of the other, but much of the conflict reflects a consistent failure on all sides to understand the legitimacy of the other's narrative. To Palestine, the Palestinian people have been denied a state not just since the formation of Israel, but also for decades before that, and now they live under what amounts to a military occupation. And that's all true. To Israel, the Jewish people clearly need a homeland, which the United Nations established. And they certainly aren't the first nation state to consolidate and increase their territory via military victory, and they need to protect their nation against the many active threats made against them by their neighbors. That's also true. It's important to understand the internal logic of these competing nationalist visions. For both Zionist and Palestinian national visions to eventually work, it's necessary to understand the right of each to exist and the legitimacy of each's historical narrative. But these problems aren't thousands of years old, and they aren't intractable. They emerged in the British Mandatory period. But let's hope that by understanding that this isn't an endless religious war, that we might be closer to seeing its end. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

We actually have two videos about World War I. Today we're going to talk about how World War I happened. Next week we're going to talk about why. World War I is a really big deal, especially to those of us who are really interested in, like, industrialization and nation states and modernity, so usually we don't talk that much about wars, but we're going to make an exception. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, exception to the Mongol-tage. Yeah, no, me from the past. We don't roll the Mongol-tage every time we use the word exception, we roll it when we're talking about how the Mongols are an exception to a lot of our assumptions about civilizations. Stan, Stan, no, there are no Mongols today, we are talking about World War I. INTRO So I'm filming this in 2014, which means that the Great War started 100 years ago, and the World War I centenary is just so hot right now I can't miss out on it. So most historians agree that the event that started World War I was the assassination of Austrian Archduke Franz Ferdinand on June 28, 1914, but beyond that, there's not a lot of agreement. Others say the war really started after Franz Ferdinand bit it, like when Germany declared war or when Russia mobilized. So looking at why a war or any historical event happened means looking for a cause and effect relationship that implicitly assumes that if one particular event in a chain of events had gone differently, the historical outcome would also be different. This is why we have alternate history novels, right? Like, what would have happened in the American Civil War if the South had won the battle at Gettysburg? What would have happened if the Nazis had repulsed the D-Day invasion? In both cases, probably eventually the same outcome, but that's neither here nor there. The question we're looking at today is how, and that's a much more modest question because we can simply discuss a series of events, but it's still a complicated one. Because when you're talking about how, you're always picking from an uncountable number of things that happened. You know, a butterfly flaps its wings and that leads to a series of events, and then eventually across the world an Archduke gets killed. So even when it comes to a relatively straightforward question like how, you'll never get to the bottom of all of it, but today we're gonna discuss some of the how. So one way or another, all wars start with a breakdown in peaceful relations between the eventual belligerence, and World War I is no exception. Oh, for the love of agriculture, please stop it. Right, but World War I is a bit unusual in that we have a concrete event and a date to start our discussion. Sometimes we get lucky, historically, and there's an invasion that starts a war, like in the Korean conflict or the firing on Fort Sumter in the American Civil War. But other times it's much more butterfly-effecty, with events that might or might not lead to a war building upon each other until one side mobilizes or declares war or there's a fight over who shot first. But here we have a specific assassination of a specific Archduke, Franz Ferdinand in Sarajevo. Now, it wasn't a great day for Franz to visit Bosnia, since it was the anniversary of the Serbs' defeat at Kosovo Polje in 1389, and also St. Vitus's Day, which was a celebration for Slavic nationalists. And a Bosnian Serb named Gavrilo Princip and his co-conspirators chose to celebrate Slavic nationalism by killing Franz Ferdinand. Now, they didn't choose Franz Ferdinand at random. He was the heir apparent of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Franz Ferdinand wasn't particularly well liked, not by his uncle, who was the head of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Certainly not by Bosnian Serb nationalists, also not really by everyone else in Europe, except for the German Kaiser. But Franz Ferdinand was, in his way, kind of a moderate. Oh, it's time for the open letter? Oh, look, it's a collection of my favorite assassinated moderates. It's hard out there for a moderate. An open letter to moderates. Dear moderates, so one of the reasons that Franz Ferdinand's uncle didn't like him that much is that the emperor was really hardcore, whereas Franz Ferdinand, you know, he was kind of a moderate. He was like, you know, I'm an Austro-Hungarian through and through, but I see the Serbian argument. Really, Franz Ferdinand was the one leader in the empire who might have come up with a solution to the problems of Serbian expansion and Bosnian independence. And murdering moderates has a way of making other moderates, you know, more extreme. In short, moderates, your work may not be romantic, it may not appeal to the youth, but it is heroic and very dangerous. Best wishes, John Green. So even though Franz Ferdinand's uncle didn't particularly like him, as the emperor of Austria-Hungary, he felt a certain responsibility to, you know, do something. Otherwise, the Serbian nationalists would feel like they could expand their territory at the expense of the empire. So despite what you often hear about World War I being pointless, this makes sense as a point, sort of. Now, it's a bit of schoolyard bully kind of diplomacy, but it does make a certain sense. If Serbia can get bigger than all of the other places, we'll think that they can have nations too. Soon enough, you don't have an empire. Now, there's still some debate about whether Princip and his fellow assassins acted alone or as part of a larger conspiracy organized by the Serbian government. But the Austrians certainly thought there was broader involvement, which is why the whole thing ended up becoming a war. So Princip was a member of the scary-sounding Black Hand, a group dedicated to creating a greater Serbia that would include Bosnia. And there's some evidence that the Serbian chief of military intelligence was in on the assassination plot, or at least knew about it. In fact, it's likely that the bombs and pistols the assassins used were supplied by a Serbian army officer, but this is still pretty controversial, so much so that people are currently fighting about it in comments. So almost a month after the assassination, on July 23rd, Austria issued an ultimatum to Serbia. And Austria intentionally made the demand so harsh that the Serbs would inevitably have to reject them and ergo war, but that doesn't explain the month-long delay. What happened in that month? Well, Austria's foreign minister, Berktold, was afraid that if they attacked Serbia, Russia would then attack Austria-Hungary, so the Austrians spent that month talking to their ally Germany to make sure the Germans would have Austria's back. The Austro-Hungarians got assurance on July 5th or July 6th in the form of what has been called the Blank Check, a promise from Germany that they would help Austria if Russia mobilized. And it was clear that the Germans expected the Austrians to move quickly in response to the assassination, not like wait for another 20 days. So usually I don't care about dates, but at this point the timing becomes pretty important. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. So when the Serbs received the Austrian ultimatum, Russia declared itself to be in a period preparatory to war, which sounds a lot like mobilization, but technically it wasn't, which Russia's foreign minister emphasized to the Germans. The Tsar approved the measure on July 25th and it went into effect on July 26th. The Serbs rejected Austria's ultimatum on July 25th, but they made the rejection sound like a capitulation, so the Germans thought that war had been averted. And they were kind of surprised then on July 28th when Austria suddenly declared war on Serbia, even though the Austrian army wasn't actually ready to start fighting. Then on July 30th, Russia exited its period preparatory to war and actually officially mobilized. Germany warned the Russians to stand down, but two days later, on August 1st, France mobilized its armed forces in support of Russia, and that same day Germany mobilized and declared war on Russia. So if you're keeping score at home, and good historians always do, Austria and Germany were the first to declare war on July 28th and August 1st respectively, but Russia, with its pre-mobilization mobilization, was actually ready to begin fighting before Serbia rejected Austria's ultimatum. Anyway, then Germany declared war on France on August 3rd, marched through Belgium to invade, hoping to quickly knock out the French and focus on Russia. Sorry France, but you know, Russia's a big deal and you, you know. German troops crossed Belgium's border on August 4th and the British issued an ultimatum to the Germans telling them to get out of Belgium or else Germany chose or else, and Britain declared war. So by August 4th, 1914, all the major powers involved in World War I were officially at war with each other. Thanks Thought Bubble. Now I know there were a lot of other powers that would get involved later, including the United States and Japan and the Ottoman Empire, even Italy. But for the nations who did most of the actual fighting, Germany, Austria, Hungary, Russia, Serbia, France, Great Britain, the war happened both very quickly and very slowly. Now looking back, it all happened almost at once, but if you're in the middle of it, a month is a long time. And at any point someone, like say the Archduke Franz Ferdinand, could have come in and said, wait a second. Well, I guess not anyone, because he was dead. But that's how an act of terrorism in a Bosnian city turned into the first major European war of the 20th century, a war that still resonates today. Now the Austrians and the Serbs probably both imagined that the war could stay localized to the Balkans, especially since there had been previous conflicts in the region that hadn't blown up into a world war. You know, like in 1908, and 1912, and 1913. We'll get into what made 1914 different next week. The whys, of course, will always be very complicated, but for now, please remember that we are always in the middle of a how. Those living in June and July of 1914 could never have imagined how significant that month would be for human history. And when thinking about them, it's worth remembering that we also can't imagine what our decisions today will mean in a hundred years. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week.

Or made a casual reference to someone having hepatitis? Or maybe teased your buddy by saying he has muscular dystrophy? Of course you have never done that. Because you are not a terrible person, you'd never make fun of someone for having a physical illness. But folks make all kinds of offhand remarks about people having mental illnesses and never give it a second thought. How often have you heard a person say that someone's psycho or schizo or bipolar or OCD? I can pretty much guarantee that the people who used those terms had no idea what they actually meant. We've talked about how psychological disorders and the people who have them have often been stigmatized. But at the same time, we tend to minimize those disorders, using them as nicknames for things that people do, think, or say, that may not exactly be universal, but are still basically healthy. And we all do it, but only because we don't really understand those conditions. But that's why we're here, because as we go deeper into psychological disorders, we get a clearer understanding of their symptoms, types, causes, and the perspectives that help explain them. And some of the most common disorders have their root in an unpleasant mental state that's familiar to us all. Anxiety. It's a part of being human, but for some people it can develop into intense fear and paralyzing dread, and ultimately turn into full-fledged anxiety disorder. Defining psychological disorders again. A deviant, distressful, dysfunctional pattern of thoughts, feelings, or behaviors that interferes with the ability to function in a healthy way. So when it comes to anxiety, that definition is the difference between the guy you probably called phobic because he didn't like Space Mountain as much as you did, and the person who truly can't leave their house for fear of interacting with others. It's the difference between the girl who's teased by her friends as being OCD because she does her laundry every night, and the girl who has to wash her hands so often that they bleed. Starting today, you're gonna understand all those terms you've been using. [♪ INTRO & MUSIC PLAYING 》 We commonly equate anxiety with fear, but anxiety disorders aren't just a matter of fear itself. A key component is also what we do to get rid of that fear. Say someone almost drowned as a kid and is now afraid of water. A family picnic at the river may cause that anxiety to bubble up, and to cope, they may stay sequestered in the car. Less anxious, but probably still unhappy, while the rest of the family is having fun. So in clinical terms, anxiety disorders are characterized not only by distressing persistent anxiety, but also often by the dysfunctional behaviors that reduce that anxiety. At least a fifth of all people will experience a diagnosable anxiety disorder of some kind at some point in their lives. That is a lot of us. So I want to start out with a condition that used to be categorized as an anxiety disorder, but is now considered complex enough to be in a class by itself, obsessive-compulsive disorder, or OCD. You probably know that condition is characterized by unwanted, repetitive thoughts, which become obsessions, which are sometimes accompanied by actions, which become compulsions. And it is a great example of a psychological disorder that could use some mental health myth-busting. Being neat and orderly and fastidious does not make you OCD. OCD is a debilitating condition whose sufferers take normal behaviors, like washing your hands or double-checking that you turned off the stove, and perform them compulsively. And they often use these compulsive, even ritualistic behaviors to relieve intense and unbearable anxiety. So soon they're scrubbing their hands every five minutes, or constantly checking the stove, or counting the exact number of steps they take everywhere they go. If you're still unclear about what it means for disorders to be deviant, distressful, and dysfunctional, OCD might help you understand. Because it is hard to keep a job, run a household, sit still, or do much of anything if you feel intensely compelled to run to the kitchen 20 times an hour. And both the thoughts and behaviors associated with OCD are often driven by a fear that is itself obsessive. Like, if you don't go to the kitchen right now, your house will burn down and your child will die, which makes the condition that much more distressing and self-reinforcing. There are treatments that help OCD, including certain kinds of psychotherapy and some psychotropic drugs. But the key here is that it is not a description for your roommate who cleans her bathroom twice a week, or the guy in the cubicle next to you who only likes to use green felt-tip pens. And even though OCD is considered its own unique set of psychological issues, the pervasive senses of fear, worry, and loss of control that often accompany it have a lot in common with other anxiety disorders. The broadest of these is generalized anxiety disorder, or GAD. People with this condition tend to feel continually tense and apprehensive, experiencing unfocused, negative, and out-of-control feelings. Of course, feeling this way occasionally is common enough, but feeling it consistently for over six months, the length of time required for a formal diagnosis, is not. Folks with GAD worry all the time and are frequently agitated and on edge, but unlike some other kinds of anxiety, patients often can't identify what's causing the anxiousness, so they don't even know what to avoid. Then there's panic disorder, which affects about one in 75 people, most often teens and young adults. Its calling card is panic attacks, or sudden episodes of intense dread or sudden fear that come without warning. Unlike the symptoms of GAD, which can be hard to pin down, panic attacks are brief, well-defined, and sometimes severe bouts of elevated anxiety. And if you've ever had one or been with someone who has, you know that they call these attacks for good reason. They can cause chest pains and racing heartbeat, difficulty breathing, and a general sense that you're going crazy or even dying. It's as awful as it sounds. We've talked a lot about the body's physiological fight or flight response, and that's definitely part of what's going on here, even though there often isn't an obvious trigger. There may be a genetic predisposition to panic disorder, but persistent stress or having experienced psychological trauma in the past can also set you up for these attacks. And because the attacks themselves can be downright terrifying, a common trigger for panic disorder is simply the fear of having another panic attack. How's that for a kick in the head? Say you have a panic attack on a bus, so you find yourself hyperventilating in front of dozens of strangers with nowhere to go to calm yourself down. That whole ordeal might make you never want to be in that situation again, so your anxiety could lead you to start avoiding crowded or confined places. At this point, the initial anxiety has spun off into a fear of anxiety, which means, welcome, you've migrated into another realm of anxiety disorder, phobias. And again, this is a term that's been misused for a long time to describe people who say don't like cats or are uncomfortable on long plane trips. Simply experiencing fear or discomfort doesn't make you phobic. In clinical terms, phobias are persistent, irrational fears of specific objects, activities, or situations that also, and this is important, leads to avoidance behavior. You hear a lot about fears of heights or spiders or clowns, and those are real things. They're specific phobias that focus on particular objects or situations. For example, the Chesapeake Bay Bridge in Maryland is a 7,000-meter span that crosses the Chesapeake Bay. If you want to get to or from Eastern Maryland, that's pretty much the only way to do it, at least in a car. But there are thousands of people who are so afraid of crossing that bridge that they simply can't do it. So, to accommodate this avoidance behavior, driver's services are available. For $25, people with Jephyrophobia, a fear of bridges, can hire someone to drive themselves and their kids and dogs and groceries across the bridge in their own car while trying not to freak out. But other phobias lack such specific triggers. What we might think of as social phobia, currently known as social anxiety disorder, is characterized by anxiety related to interacting or being seen by others, which could be triggered by a phone call or being called on in class or just thinking about meeting new people. So you can probably see at this point how anxiety disorders are related and how they can be difficult to tease apart. The same thing can be said about what we think causes them. Because much in the same way that anxiety can show up as both a feeling, like panic, and a thought, like is my kitchen on fire, there are also two main perspectives on how we currently view anxiety as a function of both learning and biology. The learning perspective suggests that things like conditioning, observational learning, and cognition, all of which we've talked about before, best explain the source of our anxiety. Remember our behaviorist friend John B. Watson and his conditioning experiments with poor little Albert? By making loud, scary noise every time he showed the kid a white rat, he ended up conditioning the boy to fear any furry object, from bunnies to dogs to fur coats. That conditioning used two specific learning processes to cement itself in little Albert's young mind. Stimulus generalization expanded or generalized his fear of the rat to other furry objects. The same principle holds true if you were like attacked by your neighbor's mean parrot and subsequently fear all birds. But then the anxiety is solidified through reinforcement. Every time you avoid or escape a feared situation, a pair of fuzzy slippers or a rabbit on the street, you ease your anxiety, which might make you feel better temporarily. But it actually reinforces your phobic behavior, making it stronger. Cognition also influences our anxiety, whether we interpret a strange noise outside as a hungry bear or a robber or merely the wind, determines if we roll over and keep snoring or freak out and run for a kitchen knife. And we might also acquire anxiety from other people through observational learning. A parent who's terrified of water may end up instilling that fear in their child by violently snatching them away from kiddie pools or generally acting anxious around park fountains and duck ponds. But there are also equally important biological perspectives. Central selection, for instance, might explain why we seem more likely to fear certain potentially dangerous animals, like snakes, or why fears of heights or closed-in spaces are relatively common. It's probably true that our more wary ancestors who had the sense to stay away from cliff edges and hissing serpents were more likely to live another day and pass along their genes, so this might explain why those fears can persist, and why even people who live in places without poisonous snakes would still fear snakes anyway. And then you got the genetics and the brain chemistry to consider. Researchers shown, for example, that identical twins, those eternal test subjects, are more likely to develop similar phobias, even if they're raised apart. Some researchers have detected 17 different genes that seem to be expressed with various anxiety disorders, so it may be that some folks are just naturally more anxious than others, and they might pass on that quality to their kids. And of course, individual brains have a lot to say about how they process anxiety. Physiologically, people who experience panic attacks, generalized anxiety, or obsessive compulsions show over-arousal in the areas of the brain that deal with impulse control and habitual behaviors. Now, we don't know whether these irregularities caused the disorder or caused by it, but again, it reinforces the truism that everything that is psychological is simultaneously biological. And that holds true for many other psychological disorders we'll talk about in the coming weeks, many of which have names that you've also heard being misused in the past. Today, you learned what defines an anxiety disorder, as well as the symptoms of obsessive compulsive disorder, generalized anxiety disorder, panic disorder, and phobias. You also learned about the two main perspectives on the origins of anxiety disorders, the learning perspective and the biological perspective, and hopefully you learned not to use OCD as a punchline from now on.

Squarespace, share your passion with the world. Aristotle once described humans as the rational animal. Well, actually, he said that man is the rational animal, but we don't have to be sexist just because he was. And if you've ever gotten into an argument with someone about religion or politics or which Hemsworth is the hottest, then you've experienced how irrational people can be about their opinions. But what Aristotle meant is that rationality is our distinguishing characteristic. It's what sets us apart from the beasts. And no matter how much you disagree with someone about God or Obama or Chris Hemsworth, you can at least grant that they are not beasts. Because, most of the time at least, people can be persuaded by arguments. You use arguments all the time. In the comments, at family dinners, with your friends. You probably just don't think of them the same way that philosophers do. When you try and convince your parents to loan you the car, or when you're talking up Crash Course to your friends, you are using arguments. Thanks, by the way. Each time you tell someone to do or believe something, or when you're explaining why you do or believe something, you are giving an argument. The problem is, the vast majority of people aren't really good at arguments. We tend to confuse making a good argument with, like, having witty comebacks, or just making your points more loudly and angrily, instead of building a case on a solid foundation of logic, which can be harder than it sounds. But learning about arguments and strong reasoning will not only make you a better philosopher, it will also set you up to be a more persuasive person. Someone who people will listen to. Someone who's convincing. So yeah, these skills are beneficial no matter what you want to do with your life, so you might as well know how to argue properly. [♪ INTRO & MUSIC PLAYING The If you want to learn how to argue, then you should probably start around 2400 years ago, when Plato was laying out how reason can and should function in the human mind. He believed that we all have what he called a tripartite soul, what you might think of as yourself or your psyche, divided into three parts. First, there's the rational, or logical, part of the soul, which represents cool reason. This is the aspect of yourself that seeks the truth and is swayed by facts and arguments. When you decide to stop eating bacon for two meals a day because, as delicious as it is, it's bad for you, then you make that decision with the guidance of the rational part of your soul. But then there's the spirited aspect, often described as the emotional part of the self, although that doesn't really quite capture it. The spirited soul isn't just about feeling, it's also about how your feelings fuel your actions. It's the part that responds in righteous anger at injustice, the part that drives your ambition and calls upon you to protect others. It gives you a sense of honor and duty, and is swayed by sympathy. So if you decide to stop eating bacon because you just finished reading Charlotte's Web, and now you're in love with Wilbur, then you're being guided by the spirited part of your soul. But we share the next part of our soul with other animals, be they pig, or moose, or aardvark. The appetitive part is what drives you to eat, have sex, and protect yourself from danger. It is swayed by temptations that are carnal and visceral. So at those times when you go ahead and just eat all the bacon because it just smells so dang good, the appetitive aspect of your soul is in control. Now, Plato believed that the best human beings, and I should point out here that Plato most definitely did believe that some people were better than others, are always ruled by the rational part of their soul, because it works to keep the spirited and the appetitive parts in check. People who allow themselves to be ruled by their spirited or appetitive selves are base, he believed, and not fully properly human. Now, most of us don't buy into the concept of the tripartite soul anymore, or the idea that some humans are less human than others. But we do understand that we're all motivated by physical desires, emotional impulses, and rational arguments. And philosophers continue to agree with Plato that reason should be in the driver's seat. So how do you know if you're good at it? How can you test your reasoning? Well, let's head over to the Thought Bubble for some flash philosophy. Throughout this course, we're going to apply our philosophical skills by pondering puzzles, paradoxes, and thought experiments. Because remember, philosophers love thinking about questions, especially ones that don't have ready answers. So think of these exercises as philosophical wind sprints, quick tests of your mental abilities. And here's a doozy from 20th century British thinker Bertrand Russell, one of the pioneers of what's known as analytic philosophy. Say there's a town in which all men are required by law to be clean-shaven. This town has only one barber, a man who must follow strict rules. Rule number one, he must shave all men who do not shave themselves. Rule number two, he must not shave any man who does shave himself. It's the nightmare of every libertarian and every mustachioed hipster, but here's the question. Does the barber shave himself? Because think about it, the barber only shaves men who don't shave themselves. So if he does shave himself, then he must not, because the barber's not allowed to shave guys who shave themselves. But if he doesn't shave himself, then he has to be shaved by the barber, because that's the law. Russell came up with this puzzle to illustrate the fact that a group must always be a member of itself. That means, in this case, that all men who shave themselves has to include every guy who shaves himself, including the barber. Otherwise, the logic that dictates the group's existence just doesn't hold up. And if the barber is a logical impossibility, then he can't exist, which means the reasoning behind his existence is inherently flawed. And philosophy doesn't tolerate flawed reasoning. So how do we make sure that we're ruled by good sound, not flawed reason? By perfecting the art of the argument. An argument in philosophy isn't just a shouting match. Instead, philosophers maintain that your beliefs should always be backed up by reasons, which we call premises. Premises form the structure of your argument. They offer evidence for your belief, and you can have as many premises as you like as long as they support your conclusion, which is the thing that you actually believe. So let's dissect the anatomy of an argument. There are actually several different species of arguments. Probably the most familiar and the easiest to carry out is the deductive argument. The main rule of a deductive argument is, if your premises are true, then your conclusion must be true. And knowing that something is actually true is very rare and awesome. So here's a boiled down version of a good deductive argument. Premise one, all humans are mortal. Premise two, Socrates is human. Conclusion, Socrates is mortal. This kind of reasoning, where one fact leads to another, is called entailment. Once we know that all humans are mortal and that Socrates is human, those facts entail that Socrates is mortal. Deduction begins with the general, in this case what we know about human mortality, and reasons down to the specific, Socrates in particular. What's great about deductive arguments is that the truth of the premises must lead to the truth of the conclusion. When this happens, we say that the argument is valid. There's no way for the conclusion to be false if the premises are true. Now check out this argument. All humans are mortal, Socrates is a human, therefore Socrates was Plato's teacher. That argument is invalid because nothing about human mortality can prove that Socrates was Plato's teacher. As you might have noticed, there are plenty of mortal humans who never taught Plato. What's interesting though is that this argument does happen to have a true conclusion, which leads us to another issue, and that is, validity is not the same as truth. All valid really means is that if the premises are true, then your conclusion can't be false. But that doesn't mean that your premises prove your conclusion to be correct. Like in the case of whether Socrates was Plato's teacher, the premises are true, and the conclusion is true, but the argument is still not valid, because the premises don't in any way prove the conclusion. It just happens to be true. So if your premises don't guarantee the truth of your conclusion, then you can end up with some really crappy arguments, like this one. All cats are mammals, I'm a mammal, therefore I'm a cat. As much as part of me would like to be my cat, this is invalid, because the conclusion doesn't entail from the premises, at all. I mean, all cats are mammals, but all mammals aren't cats, which means there are such things as non-cat mammals, which I am just one example of. And it probably goes without saying, but you can have a perfectly valid argument, and still have a false conclusion, if any of your premises are false. For example, all humans have tails, my brother John is a human, therefore John Green has a tail. The argument is totally valid, because the premises entail the conclusion. The reasoning totally stands up. It's just that one of the premises is flawed. Since I'm reasonably certain that John doesn't have a tail, I've seen him in a bathing suit, this argument is not deductively sound. And a deductively sound argument is one that's free of formal flaws or defects. It's an argument whose premises are all true, and that's valid, which means its conclusion is guaranteed to be true. So, sound arguments should always be your goal. The reason that deduction is prized by philosophers and lots of other important kinds of thinkers is that it's the only kind of argument that can give you a real certainty. But it's limited, because it only works if you're starting with known, true premises, which are hard to come by. And for what it's worth, deductive truths are usually pretty obvious. They don't tend to lead us to startling new information, like the fact that I'm not a cat, or that John doesn't have a tail. So instead of starting with premises that are already certain, like deduction does, you're going to have to know how to determine the truth of, and your confidence in, your premises. Which means you're going to have to acquaint yourself with the other species of arguments, which we're going to do next time. But today we talked about the value of reason, the structure of arguments, and we took a close look at one kind of argument, deductive reasoning.

Mr. Green, Mr. Green, Mr. Green, which situation? Oh, me from the past. I forgot you wanted to go to Columbia. Me from the present regrets to inform you that you do not get in. But since you live in the past, you have no way of knowing who I'm talking about. And it occurs to me that this video may be watched in some glorious future, when Kim Kardashian and the situation have mercifully disappeared from public life. And the supermarket tabloids, instead of talking about celebrities, talk about Foucault and the Higgs boson particle. So Kim Kardashian is a professional famous person who initially rose to notoriety by scoodily pooping with someone named Ray J. And Mike, the situation, I forgot his last name, is a professional stupid person with big muscles. They're both known by millions, live in luxury, and people literally pay to own their odors. Why do these people crave fame? Why do any of us? Well, I'd argue it's not about money if it were, our tabloids would be devoted to the lives and times of bankers. I think we all want to leave a legacy. We want to be remembered. We want to be great. INTRO For a long time, history was all about the study of great men, and it was common to call people the great, although these days historians are less likely to do that because they recognize that one man's great is generally another man's terrible. And also the great has some misogynistic implications, like it's almost always men who are called the great. You never hear of Cleopatra the Great or Elizabeth the Great. Sure, there's Catherine the Great of Russia, but for her masculine greatness, she was saddled with the completely untrue rumor that she died trying to scoodily poop with a horse. Saddled? Get it? Anybody? Saddled with the rumor? Anyway, they could have soiled Catherine the Great's name just by telling the truth, which is that like so many other great men and women, she died on the toilet. Get it? Soiled? Toilet? Yes? Yes. So quick biography of Alexander of Macedon. Born in 356 BCE, died in 323 BCE at the ripe old age of 32. Alexander was the son of King Philip II, and when just 13 years old, he tamed a horse no one else could ride named Bucephalus, which impressed his father so much that he said, Oh thy son, look thee out at a kingdom equal to and worthy of thyself, for Macedonia is too little for thee. By that time he was already an accomplished general, but over the next decade he expanded his empire with unprecedented speed and he is famous for having never lost a battle. Today we're going to look at Alexander of Macedon's story by examining three possible definitions of greatness. First, maybe Alexander was great because of his accomplishments. This is an extension of the idea that history is the record of the deeds of great men. Now, of course, that's ridiculous. For one thing, half of people are women. For another, and this is important, there are lots of historical events that no one can take responsibility for, like for instance, the Black Plague. Still, Alexander was accomplished. I mean, he conquered a lot of territory. Like, a lot. His father Philip had conquered all of Greece, but Alexander did with the Spartans and the Athenians had failed to do. He destroyed the Persian Empire. He conquered all the land the Persians had held, including Egypt, and then marched toward India, stopping at the Indus River only because his army was like, hey, Alexander, you know what would be awesome? Not marching. Also, Alexander was a really good general, although historians disagree over whether his tactics were truly brilliant or if his army just happened to have better technology, specifically these extra long spears called seresas. But much of his reputation as a general, and his reputation in general, anybody? Puns? Maybe I should stop? Okay. Is because of Napoleon. Napoleon, like many other generals through the millennia, was obsessed with Alexander the Great, but more on that in a moment. That said, Alexander wasn't very good at what we might now call empire building. Alexander's empire is definitely visually impressive, but it wasn't actually much of an empire. Like, Alexander specialized in the tearing down of things, but he wasn't so great at the building up of institutions to replace the things he'd torn down. And that's why pretty soon after his death, his empire broke into three empires, called the Hellenistic Kingdoms. Each was ruled by one of Alexander's generals, and they became important dynasties. The Antigonids in Greece and Macedonia, the Ptolemies in Egypt, the Seleucids in Persia, all of which lasted longer than Alexander's empire itself. A second kind of greatness. Maybe Alexander was great because he had an enormous impact on the world after his death. Like King Tut, Alexander the Great was amazingly good at being a dead person. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. So after Alexander of Macedon died, everyone, from the Romans to Napoleon to Oliver Stone, loved him, and he was an important military model for many generals throughout history. But his main post-death legacy may be that he introduced the Persian idea of absolute monarchy to the Greco-Roman world, which would become a pretty big deal. Alexander also built a number of cities on his route that became big deals after his death, and it's easy to spot them because he named most of them after himself and one after his horse. The Alexandrian Egypt became a major center of learning in the classical world and was home to the most amazing library ever, which Julius Caesar probably accidentally burned down while trying to conquer a bunch of land to emulate his hero, Alexander the Great. Plus, the dead Alexander had a huge impact on culture. He gave the region its common language, Greek, which facilitated conversations and commerce. Greek was so widespread that archaeologists have found coins in what is now Afghanistan with pictures of their kings with the word king written beneath the pictures in Greek. This is also why, incidentally, the New Testament was eventually written in Greek. Although Alexander was mostly just conquering territory for the glory and heroism and greatness of it all, in his wake emerged a more closely connected world that could trade and communicate with more people more efficiently than ever before. Alexander didn't make those things happen, but they probably wouldn't have happened without him. But here's a question. If you're watching Jersey Shore and get so involved in the situation's romantic conquest that you leave the bathwater running, thereby flooding your apartment, and you have to call a plumber and the plumber comes over and you fall in love with him and get married and live happily ever after, does that make this situation responsible for your marriage? Thanks, Thought Bubble. Okay, a third definition of greatness. Maybe Alexander is great because of his legend. Since no accounts of Alexander were written while he was alive, embellishment was easy. And maybe that's where true greatness lies. I mean, the guy died at 32 before he ever had a chance to get old and lose battles. He was tutored by Aristotle, for God's sakes. Then there's Alexander's single-minded, obsessive Ahab-esque pursuit of the Persian king Darius, who he chased across modern-day Iraq and Iran for no real reason except that he desperately wanted to kill him. And when Bessus, one of Darius' generals, assassinated him before Alexander had the chance, Alexander chased Bessus around until he could at least kill him. These almost comical pursuits of glory and heroism are accompanied in classical histories by stories of Alexander walking through the desert and it's suddenly raining and these ravens coming to lead him to the army he's supposed to fight. And stories of his hot Persian wife Roxana, who while still a teenager, engineered the assassination of many of Alexander's fellow wives. And even in his death, people tried to make Alexander live up to this heroic ideal. Like, Plutarch tells us that he died of a fever, but that's no way for a masculine, empire-building, awesome person to die. So rumors persist that he died either of alcohol poisoning or else of assassination-y poisoning. I mean, no great man can die of a fever. Speaking of great men, it's time to strip down for the open letter. So elegant. But first, let's see what's in the secret compartment today. Oh, it's Kim Kardashian's perfume. Thanks, Stan. I'll wear this. I'll check it out. I'll give it a try. Ah. Wow. That is... Mmm. It's like all the worst parts of baby powder and all the worst parts of cat pee. An open letter to the ladies. Hello, ladies. You've really been unfairly neglected in Crash Course World History, and also in world history textbooks everywhere. Like, there will be a whole chapter exploring the exploits of great men, and then at the end there will be one sentence that's like, also women were doing stuff at the time and it was important, but we don't really know what it was. So back to Alexander the Great. History has been very good at marginalizing and demeaning women, and we're going to fight against that as we move forward in the story of human civilization. Ladies, I have to go now because my eyes are stinging from the biological weapon known as Kim Kardashian's gold. Seriously, don't wear it. Best wishes, John Green. So in Alexander the Great we have a story of a man who united the world while riding a magical horse, only he could tame across deserts where it magically rained for him so that he could chase down his mortal enemy and then leave in his wake a more enlightened world and a gorgeous, murderous wife. But of course it's not just Assassin's Creed and Call of Duty that celebrate the idea that ennobled violence can lead to a better world. And that takes us to my opinion of how Alexander really came to be great. Millennia after his death in 1798, Napoleon invaded Egypt not because he particularly needed to invade Egypt, but because he wanted to do what Alexander had done. And long before Napoleon, the Romans really worshipped Alexander, particularly the Roman general Pompey, aka Pompeius Magnus, aka Pompey the Great. Pompey was so obsessed with Alexander that he literally tried to emulate Alexander's boyishly disheveled hairstyle. In short, Alexander is great because others decided he was great because they chose to admire and emulate him. Yes, Alexander was a great general. Yes, he conquered a lot of land. The situation is also really good at picking up girls of a certain type. And Kim Kardashian is good at— Stan, what is Kim Kardashian good at? We made Alexander great, just as today we make people great when we admire them and try to emulate them. History has traditionally been in the business of finding and celebrating great men, and only occasionally great women. But this obsession with greatness is troubling to me. It wrongly implies first that history is made primarily by men, and secondly that history is made primarily by celebrated people, which of course makes us all want to be celebrities. Thankfully, we've left behind the idea that the best way to become an icon is to butcher people and conquer a lot of land, but the ideals that we've embraced instead aren't necessarily worth celebrating either. All of which is to say, we decide what to worship and what to care about and what to pay attention to. We decide whether to care about the situation. Alexander couldn't make history in a vacuum, and neither can anyone else. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week. Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan Miller.

Oh, Stan, do we have to talk about the Crusades? I hate them. Here's the thing about the Crusades, which were a series of military expeditions from parts of Europe to the eastern coast of the Mediterranean. The real reason they feature so prominently in history is because we've endlessly romanticized the story of the Crusades. We've created this simple narrative with characters to root for and to root against, and it's been endlessly idealized by the likes of Sir Walter Scott and there are knights with swords and lion hearts. No, Stan, lion hearts. Thank you. INTRO Let's start by saying that initially the Crusades were not a holy war on the part of Europeans against Islam, but in important ways the Crusades were driven by religious faith. Mr. Green, religion causes all wars, imagine no war. I'm going to cut you off right there before you violate copyright, me from the past, but as usual, you're wrong. Simple readings of history are rarely sufficient. By the way, when did my handwriting get so much better? I mean, if the Crusades had been brought on by the lightning-fast rise of the Islamic Empire and a desire to keep in Christian hands the land of Jesus, then they would have started in the 8th century. But early Islamic dynasties like the Umayyads and the Abbasids were perfectly happy with Christians and Jews living among them, as long as they paid a tax. And plus, the Christian pilgrimage business was awesome for the Islamic Empire's economy. But then a new group of Muslims, the Seljuk Turks, moved into the region and they sacked the holy cities and made it much more difficult for Christians to make their pilgrimages. And while they quickly realized their mistake, it was already too late. The Byzantines, who'd had their literal asses kicked at the Battle of Manzikert in 1071, felt the threat and called upon the West for help. So the first official crusade began with a call to arms by Pope Urban II in 1095 CE. This was partly because Urban wanted to unite Europe and he'd figured out the lesson the rest of us learned from alien invasion movies. The best way to get people to unite is to give them a common enemy. So Urban called on all the bickering knights and nobility of Europe and he saideth unto his people, let us go forth and help the Byzantines, because then maybe they will acknowledge my awesomeness and get rid of their stupid not having me as Pope thing. And while we're at it, let's liberate Jerusalem. I'm paraphrasing, by the way. Shifting the focus to Jerusalem was really important because the crusades were not primarily military operations. They were pilgrimages. Theologically, Christianity didn't have an idea of a holy war. Like war might be just, but fighting wasn't something that got you into heaven. But pilgrimage to a holy shrine could help you out on that front and Urban had the key insight to pitch the crusade as a pilgrimage with a touch of warring on the side. I do the same thing to my kid every night. I'm not feeding you dinner featuring animal crackers. I'm feeding you animal crackers featuring dinner. Oh, it's time for the open letter? An open letter to animal crackers. But first, let's see what's in the secret compartment today. Oh, it's animal crackers. Thanks, Dan. Hi there, animal crackers. It's me, John Green. Thanks for being delicious, but let me throw out a crazy idea here. Maybe foods that are already delicious do not need the added benefit of being pleasingly shaped. I mean, why can't I get my kid animal spinach or animal sweet potato or even animal cooked animal? We haven't put a man on Mars, but we can't make spinach shaped like elephants? What, Stan? We haven't put a man on Mars? Stupid world always disappointing me. Best wishes, John Green. One last myth to dispel. The Crusades were not an example of early European colonization of the Middle East, even if they did create some European-ish kingdoms there for a while. That's a much later post and anti-colonialist view that comes at least in part from a Marxist reading of history. In the case of the Crusades, it was argued the knights who went adventuring in the Levant were the second and third sons of wealthy nobles who, because of European inheritance rules, had little to look forward to by staying in Europe and lots to gain in terms of plunder by going to the East. Tool theory, bro, but it's not true. First, most of the people who responded to the call to crusade weren't knights at all. They were poor people. And secondly, most of the nobles who did go crusading were lords of estates, not their wastrel kids. But more importantly, that analysis ignores religious motivations. We've approached religions as historical phenomena, thinking about how, for instance, the capricious environment of Mesopotamia led to a capricious cadre of Mesopotamian gods. But just as the world shapes religion, religion also shapes the world. And some modern historians might ignore religious motivations, but medieval crusaders sure as hell didn't. I mean, when people came up with that idiom, they clearly thought hell was for sure. To the crusaders, they were taking up arms to protect Christ and his kingdom. And what better way to show your devotion to God than putting a cross on your sleeve, spending five to six times your annual income to outfit yourself and all your horses, and heading for the Holy Land. So when these people cried out, God wills it, to explain their reasons for going, we should do them the favor of believing them. And the results of the First Crusade seemed to indicate that God had willed it. Following the lead of roving preachers with names like Peter the Rabbit, Peter the Hermit, Stan, you're always making history less cool. Fine. Following preachers like Peter the Hermit, thousands of peasants and nobles alike volunteered for the First Crusade, it got off to kind of a rough start because pilgrims kept robbing those they'd encounter along the way. Plus there was no real leader, so there were constant rivalries between nobles about who could supply the most troops. Notable among the notables were Godfrey of Bullion, Bohemond of Toronto, and Raymond of Toulouse. But despite the rivalries and the disorganization, the crusaders were remarkably, some would say miraculously, successful. By the time they arrived in the Levant, they were fighting not against the Seljuq Turks, but against Fatimid Egyptians who had captured the Holy Land from the Seljuqs, thereby making the Turks none too pleased with the Egyptians. At Antioch, the crusaders reversed a seemingly hopeless situation when a peasant found the spear that had pierced Christ's side hidden under a church, thereby raising morale enough to win the day. And then they did the impossible. They took Jerusalem, securing it for Christendom and famously killing a lot of people in the Alaska Mosque. Now, the crusaders succeeded in part because the Turkish Muslims, who were Sunnis, did not step up to help the Egyptians, who were Shia. But that kind of complicated intra-Islamic rivalry gets in the way of the awesome narrative. The Christians just saw it as a miracle. So by 1100 CE, European nobles held both Antioch and Jerusalem as Latin Christian kingdoms. I say Latin to make the point that there were lots of Christians living in these cities before the crusaders arrived. They just weren't Catholic. They were Orthodox, a point that will become relevant shortly. We're going to skip the second crusade because it bores me and move on to the third crusade because it's the famous one. Broadly speaking, the third crusade was a European response to the emergence of a new Islamic power, neither Turkish nor Abbasid. The Egyptian, although he was really a Kurd, Sultan al-Malik al-Nasr Saleh al-Din Yusuf, better known to the West as Saladin. Saladin, having consolidated his power in Egypt, sought to expand by taking Damascus and eventually Jerusalem, which he did successfully because he was an amazing general. And then the loss of Jerusalem caused Pope Gregory VIII to call for a third crusade. Three of the most important kings in Europe answered the call. Philip, cowardly schemer the second of France, Richard Lionheart the first of England, and Frederick I am going to drown anticlimactically on the journey while trying to bathe in a river, Barbarossa, of the not-holy, not-Roman, and not-imperial Holy Roman Empire. Both Richard and Saladin were great generals who earned the respect of their troops, and while from the European perspective the crusade was a failure because they didn't take Jerusalem, it did radically change crusading forever by making Egypt a target. Richard understood that his best chance to take Jerusalem involved first taking Egypt, but he couldn't convince any crusaders to join him because Egypt had a lot less religious value to Christians than Jerusalem. So Richard was forced to call off the crusade early, but if he had just hung around until Easter of 1192 he would have seen Saladin die. And then Richard probably could have fulfilled all his crusading dreams, but you know, then we wouldn't have needed the fourth crusade. Although crusading continued through the 14th century, mostly with an emphasis on North Africa and not the Holy Land, the fourth crusade is the last one we'll focus on because it was the crazy one. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. So a lot of people volunteered for the fourth crusade, more than 35,000, and the generals didn't want to march them all the way across Anatolia because they knew from experience that it was A, dangerous, and B, hot. So they decided to go by boat, which necessitated the building of the largest naval fleet Europe had seen since the Roman Empire. The Venetians built 500 ships, but then only 11,000 crusaders actually made it down to Venice because like, oh I meant to go but I had a thing come up, etc. There wasn't enough money to pay for those boats, so the Venetians made the crusaders a deal. Help us capture the rebellious city of Zara and we'll ferry you to Anatolia. This was a smidge problematic crusading-wise because Zara was a Christian city, but the crusaders agreed to help, resulting in the pope excommunicating both them and the Venetians. Then after the crusaders failed to take Zara and were still broke, a would-be Byzantine emperor named Alexius III promised the crusaders that he would pay them if they helped him out, so the excommunicated Catholic crusaders fought on behalf of the Orthodox Alexius, who soon became emperor in Constantinople. But it took Alexius a while to come up with the money he'd promised the crusaders, so they were waiting around in Constantinople, and then Alexius was suddenly dethroned by the awesomely named Mortsoflos, leaving the crusaders stuck in Constantinople with no money. Christian warriors couldn't very well sack the largest city in Christendom, could they? Well it turns out they could, and boy did they. They took all the wealth they could find, killed and raped Christians as they went, stole the statues of horses that now adorned St. Mark's Cathedral in Venice, and retook exactly none of the Holy Land. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So you'd think this disaster would discredit the whole notion of crusading, right? No. Instead it legitimized the idea that crusading didn't have to be about pilgrimage, that any enemies of the Catholic Church were fair game. Also the Fourth Crusade pretty much doomed the Byzantine Empire, which never really recovered. Constantinople, a shadow of its former self, was conquered by the Turks in 1453. So ultimately the Crusades were a total failure at establishing Christian kingdoms in the Holy Land long term. And with the coming of the Ottomans, the region remained solidly Muslim, as it mostly is today. And the Crusades didn't really open up lines of communication between the Christian and Muslim worlds, because those lines of communication were already open. Plus, most historians now agree that the Crusades didn't bring Europe out of the Middle Ages by offering it contact with the superior intellectual accomplishments of the Islamic world. In fact, they were a tremendous drain on Europe's resources. For me, the Crusades matter because they remind us that the medieval world was fundamentally different from ours. The men and women who took up the cross believed in the sacrality of their work in a way that we often can't even conceive of today. And when we focus so much on the heroic narrative, or the anti-imperialist narrative, or all the political infighting, we can lose sight of what the Crusades must have meant to the Crusaders. How that journey from pilgrimage to holy war transformed their faith and their lives. And ultimately, that exercise in empathy is the coolest thing about studying history. Thanks for watching.

So here at Crash Course we try to make history reasonably entertaining, and fortunately, World War II was hilarious, said no one ever. Mr. Green, Mr. Green, is it's like going to be one of the unfunny ones where you build to the big melodramatic conclusion about how I have to imagine the world more complexly? Me from the past, as long as you have that eighth-rate soup strainer, I'm not even going to acknowledge your existence. [♪Theme Music playing.] Right, so you've probably heard a lot about World War II from movies and books, the History Channel before it decided that swamp people were history, the incessant droning of your grandparents, etc. We're not going to try to give you a detailed synopsis of the war today. Instead, we're going to try to give a bit of perspective on how the most destructive war in human history happened and why it still matters globally. So one of the reasons history classes tend to be really into wars is that they're easy to put on tests. They start on one day and they end on another day, and they're caused by social, political, and economic conditions that can be examined in a multiple-choice kind of manner. Except not really. Like, when did World War II start? In September 1939, when the Nazis invaded Poland, I'd say no, it actually started when Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931, or at the very latest, when the Japanese invaded China in 1937, because they didn't stop fighting until 1945. Then again, you could also argue 1933 when Hitler took power, or 1941 when America started fighting, it's complicated. But anyway, in China the fighting was very brutal, as exemplified by the infamous Rape of Nanking, which featured the slaughter of hundreds of thousands of Chinese people and is still so controversial today that, one, it affects relations between Japan and China, and two, even though I have not described it in detail, you can rest assured that there will be angry comments about my use of the word slaughter. But the World War II we know the most about from movies and TV is primarily the war in the European theater, the one that Adolf Hitler started. Hitler is the rare individual who really did make history. Specifically, he made it worse. And if he hadn't existed, it's very unlikely that World War II would have ever happened. But he did exist. And after coming to power in 1933 with the standard revolutionary promises to return the homeland to its former glory, infused with quite a bit of paranoia and anti-Semitism, Germany saw rapid remilitarization and eventually, inevitably, war. In the beginning it was characterized by a new style of combat, made possible by the mechanized technology of tanks, airplanes, and especially trucks. This was the Blitzkrieg, a devastating tactic combining quick movement of troops, tanks, and massive use of air power to support infantry movements. And in the very early years of the war, it was extremely effective. The Nazis were able to roll over Poland, Norway, Denmark, the Netherlands, and then all of France, all within about nine months between the fall of 1939 and the summer of 1940. So after knocking out most of Central Europe, the Nazis set their sights on Great Britain. But they didn't invade the island, choosing instead to attack it with massive airstrikes. I mean, you look at this poster and think, man, the Queen wants me to finish my term paper so I can do it. But when this poster was first produced in 1939, it was to quell terror in the face of bombardment. The Battle of Britain was a duel between the Royal Air Force and the Luftwaffe. And while the RAF denied the Nazis total control of British airspace, the Nazis were still able to bomb Great Britain over and over again in what's known as the Blitz. Stan, no. No jokes this time. Yes, the Blitz. Meanwhile, Europeans were also fighting each other in North Africa. The desert campaign started in 1940 and lasted through 1942. This is where British General Monty Montgomery out-Foxed Irwin the Desert Fox Rommel. It's also the place where Americans first fought Nazis in large numbers, but most importantly, it's where Indiana Jones discovered the Ark of the Covenant. Okay, let's go to the Thought Bubble. 1941 was a big year for World War II. First, the Nazis invaded Russia, breaking a non-aggression pact that the two powers had signed in 1939. This hugely escalated the war and also made allies of the most powerful capitalist countries and the most powerful communist one an alliance that would stand the test of time and never end until like three seconds after the defeat of the Nazis. The Nazi invasion of Russia opened the war up on the so-called Eastern Front, although if you were Russian it was the Western Front, and it led to millions of deaths, mostly Russian. Also 1941 saw a day that would live in infamy when the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor, hoping that such an audacious attack would frighten the United States into staying neutral, which was a pretty stupid gamble because one, the U.S. was already giving massive aid to the allies and was hardly neutral, and two, the United States is not exactly famed for its pacifism or political neutrality. 1941 also saw Japan invading much of Southeast Asia, which made Australia and New Zealand understandably nervous. As part of the British Commonwealth, they were already involved in the war, but now they could fight the Japanese closer to home. And shut up about how I never talk about you Australians, I just gave you 1.5 sentences. But by the time the Americans and Australians started fighting the Japanese, it was already a world war. Sometimes this meant fighting or starving or being bombed, other times it meant production for the war. You don't think of Argentina as being a World War II powerhouse, for instance, but they were vital to the Allies, supplying 40% of British meat during World War II. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So not to sound jingoistic, but the entry of the U.S. into the war really did change everything, although I doubt the Nazis could have taken Russia regardless. No one conquers Russia in the wintertime. Unless you are, wait for it, the Mongols. Okay, we're going to skip most of the big battles of 1942, like the Battle of Midway, which effectively ended Japan's chance of winning the war, and focus on the Battle of Stalingrad. The German attack on Stalingrad, now known as Volgograd because Stalin sucks, was one of the bloodiest battles in the history of war, with more than 2 million dead. The Germans began by dropping more than a thousand tons of bombs on Stalingrad, and then the Russians responded by hugging the Germans, staying as close to their front lines as possible so that German air support would kill Germans and Russians alike. This kind of worked, although the Germans still took most of the city, but then a Soviet counterattack left the 6th Army of the Nazis completely cut off. And after that, due partly to Hitler's overreaching megalomania and partly to lots of people being scared of him, the 6th Army slowly froze and starved to death before finally surrendering. And of the 91,000 Axis POWs from Stalingrad, only about 6,000 ever returned home. Stalingrad turned the war in Europe, and by 1944 the American strategy of island hopping in the Pacific was taking GIs closer and closer to Japan. Rome was liberated in June by Americans and Canadians. And the successful British, Canadian, and American D-Day invasion of Normandy was the beginning of the end for the Nazis. Oh, it's time for the open letter? An open letter to Canada. But first, let's see what's in the secret compartment today. Oh, it's Canadian mittens! I want to thank the Canadian Crash Course fans who sent us these mittens. Canadians are just so nice, Dan. Like, all we ever do on this show is make fun of them, and they're just like, it's so kind of you to mention us. Here's some mittens! Dear Canada, we're not always nice to you here on Crash Course, but you are awesome. I'm pointing, but you can't tell because I'm wearing mittens. 45,000 Canadians died fighting for the Allies in World War II, which means that per capita, Canada lost more people than the United States. You fought with the Royal Air Force to defend Great Britain from the beginning of the war, and you were there on D-Day successfully invading Juno Beach. And as many of you have pointed out in comments, you defeated the United States in the War of 1812, meaning that arguably, Canada, you are the greater military power. Plus, you have lumberjacks and excellent beer and hockey and universal healthcare and Justin Bieber! I'm jealous! That's what it is! I'm jealous! Best wishes, John Green. So by the end of 1944, the Allies were advancing from the west and the Russian Red Army was advancing from the east, and then the last ditched German offensive at the Battle of the Bulge in the winter of 1944 and 1945 failed. Mussolini was executed in April of 1945. Hitler committed suicide at the end of that month and on May 8, 1945, the Allies declared victory in Europe after Germany surrendered unconditionally. Three months later, the United States dropped the only two nuclear weapons ever deployed in war, Japan surrendered, and World War II was over. The war had a definite cause, unbridled military expansion by Germany, Japan, and to a small extent Italy. Now, it's easy to claim that Hitler was crazy or evil, and in fact he was certainly both, but that doesn't explain the Nazis' decision to invade Russia, and it sure doesn't explain Japan's decision to bomb Pearl Harbor. And there are many possible explanations beyond mere evil, but the most interesting one to me involves food. Hitler had a number of reasons for wanting to expand Germany's territory, but he often talked about Lebensraum, or living space, for the German people. German agriculture was really inefficiently organized into lots of small farms, and that meant that Germany needed a lot of land in order to be self-sufficient in food production. The plan was to take Poland, the Ukraine, and eastern Russia, and then resettle that land with lots of Germans so that it could feed German people. This was called the Hunger Plan, because the plan called for 20 million people to starve to death. Many would be the Poles, Ukrainians, and Russians who'd previously lived on the land. The rest would be Europe's Jews, who would be worked to death. Six million Jews were killed by the Nazis, many by starvation, but many through a chillingly planned effort of extermination in death camps. These death camps can be distinguished from concentration camps or labor camps in that their primary purpose was extermination of Jews, Roma people, communists, homosexuals, disabled people, and others that the Nazis deemed unfit. Some historians believe that the Nazis opened the death camps because the Jews weren't dying as fast as the Hunger Plan had intended. This was a sickening plan, but it made a kind of demented sense. Rather than becoming more involved in global trade as the British had, the Germans would feed themselves by taking land and killing the people who'd previously lived there. Similarly, Japan at the beginning of the war was suffering from an acute fear of food shortage because its agricultural sector was having trouble keeping up with population growth. And the Japanese too sought to expand their agricultural holdings by, for instance, resettling farmers in Korea. So while it's tempting to say that World War II was about the Allies fighting for democratic ideals against the totalitarian militaristic imperialism of the fascist Axis powers, it just doesn't hold up to scrutiny. For instance, a hugely important Allied power, Stalin's Soviet Union, was like the least democratic place ever. Dan just said that was hyperbole, but it's not. Stalin's Soviet Union is tied with all of the other completely undemocratic countries for last place on the democracy scale. It's a big community there at last place, but they're definitely in there somewhere. And by far the biggest imperialists of the war were the British. They couldn't have fed or clothed themselves or resisted the Nazis without their colonies and commonwealth. So why is World War II so important? Well, first it proved the old Roman adage, homo homini lupus, man is a wolf to man. This is seen most clearly in the Holocaust, but all the statistics are staggering. More than a million Indian-British subjects died, mainly due to famine that could have been avoided if the British had redistributed food. And their failure to do so helped convince Indians that the so-called superior civilization of the British was a sham. More than a million Vietnamese died, mainly due to famine. 418,000 Americans. More than a million non-combatants in both Germany and Japan, and 20 million people in the Soviet Union, most of them civilians. These civilians were targeted because they helped sustain the war, mostly through industrial and agricultural production. In a total war, when a nation is at war, not just its army, there's no such thing as a non-military target. From the firebombing of Dresden to Tokyo to Hiroshima, the line between soldier and civilian blurred. And then of course there is the Holocaust, which horrifies us because the elements of Western progress, record-keeping, industrial production, technology, were used to slaughter millions. World War II saw modern industrial nations, which represented the best of the Enlightenment and the Scientific Revolution, descend into once unimaginable cruelty. And what makes World War II such a historical watershed is that in its wake, all of us, in the West or otherwise, were forced to question whether Western dominance of this planet could or should be considered progress.

Yeah, Mr. Green, capitalism just turns men into wolves. Your purportedly free markets only make slaves of us all. Oh, God, Stan, it's me from college. Me from the past has become me from college. This is a disaster. The reason he's so unbearable, Stan, is that he refuses to recognize the legitimacy of other people's narratives, and that means that he will never, ever be able to have a productive conversation with another human in his entire life. So listen, me from the past, I'm going to disappoint you by being too capitalist, and I'm going to disappoint a lot of other people by not being capitalist enough, and I'm going to disappoint the historians by not using enough jargon. But what can I do? We only have 12 minutes. Fortunately, capitalism is all about efficiency, so let's do this, me from college. Randy Riggs becomes a bestselling author, Josh Radner stars in a great sitcom, it is not going to work out with Emily, and do not go to Alaska with a girl you've known for ten days. Okay, let's talk capitalism. So capitalism is an economic system, but it's also a cultural system. It's characterized by innovation and investment to increase wealth, but today we're going to focus on production and how industrial capitalism changed it. Stan, I can't wear these emblems of the bourgeoisie while Karl Marx himself is looking at me, it's ridiculous. I'm changing. Very hard to take off a shirt dramatically. So let's say it's 1200 CE and you're a rug merchant. Just like merchants today, you sometimes need to borrow money in order to buy the rugs you want to resell at a profit, and then you pay that money back, often with interest, once you've resold the rugs. This is called mercantile capitalism, and it was a global phenomenon from the Chinese to the Indian Ocean trade network to Muslim merchants who would sponsor trade caravans across the Sahara. But by the 17th century, merchants in the Netherlands and in Britain had expanded upon this idea to create joint stock companies. Those companies could finance bigger trade missions and also spread the risk of international trade. But the thing about international trade is sometimes boats sink or they get taken by pirates and while that's bad if you're a sailor because, you know, you lose your life, it's really bad if you're a mercantile capitalist because you lost all your money. But if you own one-tenth of ten boats, your risk is much better managed. That kind of investment definitely increased wealth, but it only affected a sliver of the population and it didn't create a culture of capitalism. Industrial capitalism was something altogether different, both in scale and in practice. Let's use Joyce Appleby's definition of industrial capitalism. An economic system that relies on investment of capital in machines and technology that are used to increase production of marketable goods. So imagine that someone made a stand machine. By the way, Stan, this is a remarkable likeness. And that stand machine could produce and direct ten times more episodes of Crash Course than a human stand. Well, of course, even if there are significant upfront costs, I'm going to invest in a stand machine so I can start cranking out ten times the knowledge. Stan, are you focusing on the robot instead of me? I am the star of the show! Stan, but you're going behind the globe. So when most of us think about capitalism, especially when we think about its downsides, long hours, low wages, miserable working conditions, child labor, unemployed stands, that's what we're thinking about. Now, admittedly, this is just one definition of industrial capitalism among many, but it's the definition we're going with. Alright, let's go to the Thought Bubble. Industrial capitalism developed first in Britain in the 19th century. Britain had a bunch of advantages. It was the dominant power on the seas, and it was making good money off of trade with its colonies, including the slave trade. Also, the growth of capitalism was helped by the half-century of civil unrest that resulted from the 17th century English Civil War. Now, I'm not advocating for civil wars or anything, but in this particular case, it was useful, because before the war, the British Crown had put a lot of regulations on the economy, complicated licenses, royal monopolies, etc. But during the turmoil, it couldn't enforce them, which made for freer markets. Another factor was a remarkable increase in agricultural productivity in the 16th century. As food prices started to rise, it became profitable for farmers, both large and small, to invest in agricultural technologies that would improve crop yields. Those higher prices for grain probably resulted from population growth, which in turn was encouraged by increased production of food crops. A number of these agricultural improvements came from the Dutch, who had chronic problems feeding themselves and discovered that planting different kinds of crops, like clover, that added nitrogen to the soil and could be used to feed livestock at the same time, meant that more fields could be used at once. This increased productivity eventually brought down prices, and this encouraged further innovation in order to increase yield to make up for the drop in prices. Lower food prices had an added benefit. Since food cost less and wages in England remained high, workers would have more disposable income, which meant that if there were consumer goods available, they would be consumed, which incentivized people to make consumer goods more efficiently and therefore more cheaply. You can see how this positive feedback loop leads to more food and more stuff, culminating in a world where people have so much stuff that we must rent space to store it, and so much food that obesity has become a bigger killer than starvation. Thanks, Thought Bubble. So this increased productivity also meant that fewer people needed to work in agriculture in order to feed the population. To put this in perspective, in 1520, 80% of the English population worked the land. By 1800, only 36% of adult male laborers were working in agriculture, and by 1850, that percentage had dropped to 25. This meant that when the factories started humming, there were plenty of workers to hum along with them, especially child laborers. Rrrr, rrrr, rrrrrrrrr. So far all this sounds pretty good, right? I mean, except for the child labor, who wouldn't want more, cheaper food? Yeah, well, not so fast. One of the ways the British achieved all this agricultural productivity was through the process of enclosure, whereby landlords would reclaim and privatize fields that for centuries had been held in common by multiple tenants. This increased agricultural productivity, but it also impoverished many tenant farmers, many of whom lost their livelihoods. Okay, for our purposes, capitalism is also a cultural system, rooted in the need of private investors to turn a profit. So the real change needed here was a change of mind. People had to develop the capitalist values of taking risks and appreciating innovation. And they had to come to believe that making an upfront investment in something like a stand machine could pay for itself and then some. One of the reasons that these values developed in Britain was that the people who initially held them were really good at publicizing them. Writers like Thomas Munn, who worked for the English East India Company, exposed people to the idea that the economy was controlled by markets. And other writers popularized the idea that it was human nature for individuals to participate in markets as rational actors. Even our language changed. The word individuals did not apply to persons until the 17th century. And in the 18th century, a career still referred only to horses racing lives. Perhaps the most important idea that was popularized in England was that men and women were consumers as well as producers. And that this was actually a good thing, because the desire to consume manufactured goods could spur economic growth. The main spur to trade, or rather to industry and ingenuity, is the exorbitant appetite of men, which they will take pain to gratify. So wrote John Kerry, one of capitalism's cheerleaders, in 1695. And in talking about our appetites, he wasn't just talking about food. That doesn't seem radical now, but it sure did back then. So here in the 21st century, it's clear that industrial capitalism, at least for now, has won. Sorry, buddy, but you know. You gave it a good run. You didn't know about Stalin. But capitalism isn't without its problems or its critics, and there were certainly lots of shortcomings to industrial capitalism in the 19th century. Working conditions were awful. Days were long, arduous, and monotonous. Workers lived in conditions that people living in the developed world today would associate with abject poverty. One way that workers responded to these conditions was by organizing into labor unions. Another response was in many cases purely theoretical. Socialism. Most famously, Marxian socialism. I should probably point out here that socialism is an imperfect opposite to capitalism, even though the two are often juxtaposed. Capitalism's defenders like to point out that it's natural, meaning that if left to our own devices, humans would construct economic relationships that resemble capitalism. Socialism, at least in its modern incarnations, makes fewer pretenses toward being an expression of human nature. It's the result of human choice and human planning. So socialism as an intellectual construct began in France. How'd I do, Stan? Mmm... the border between Egypt and Libya. There were two branches of socialism in France, utopian and revolutionary. Utopian socialism is often associated with Comte de Saint-Simon and Charles Fourier, both of whom rejected revolutionary action after having seen the disaster of the French Revolution. Both were critical of capitalism, and while Fourier is usually a punchline in history classes because he believed that in his ideal socialist world the seas would turn to lemonade, he was right that human beings have desires that go beyond basic self-interest and that we aren't always economically rational actors. The other French socialists were the revolutionaries, and they saw the French Revolution, even its violence, in a much more positive light. The most important of these revolutionaries was Auguste Blanqui, and we associate a lot of his ideas with communism, which is a term that he used. Like the utopians, he criticized capitalism, but he believed that it could only be overthrown through violent revolution by the working classes. However, while Blanqui thought that the workers would come to dominate a communist world, he was an elitist. And he believed that workers could never, on their own, overcome their superstitions and their prejudices in order to throw off bourgeois oppression. And that brings us to Karl Marx, whose ideas and beard cast a shadow over most of the 20th century. Oh, it's time for the open letter? An open letter to Karl Marx's beard. But first, let's see what's in the secret compartment today. Oh, robots? Stanbots? Two Stanbots, one of them female. Now I own all the means of production. You're officially useless to me, Stan. Now turn the camera off. Turn the ca— I'm gonna have to get up and turn the camera off? Stanbot, go turn the camera off. Hey there, Karl Marx's beard. Wow. You are intense. Karl Marx, these days there are a lot of young men who think beards are cool. Beard lovers, if you will. Beard lovers aren't beards, they're glorified milk mustaches. I mean, I haven't shaved for a couple weeks, Karl Marx, but I'm not claiming a beard. You don't get a beard by being lazy, you get a beard by being a committed revolutionary. That's why hardcore Marxists are literally known as bearded Marxists. These days that's an insult, but you know what, Karl Marx, when I look back at history, I prefer the bearded communists. Let's talk about some communists who didn't have beards. Mao Zedong, Paul Pot, Kim Jong-il, Joseph freaking Stalin with his face caterpillar. So yeah, Karl Marx's beard. It's my great regret to inform you that there are some paltry beards trying to take up the class struggle these days. Best wishes, John Green. Although he's often considered the father of communism because he co-wrote the Communist Manifesto, Marx was above all a philosopher and a historian. It's just that unlike most philosophers and historians, he advocated for revolution. His greatest work, Das Kapital, sets out to explain the world of the 19th century in historical and philosophical terms. Marx's thinking is deep and dense and we're low on time, but I want to introduce one of his ideas, that of class struggle. So for Marx, the focus isn't on the class, it's on the struggle. Basically, Marx believed that classes don't only struggle to make history, but that the struggle is what makes classes into themselves. The idea is that through conflict, classes develop a sense of themselves, and without conflict, there is no such thing as class consciousness. So Marx was writing in 19th century England and there were two classes that mattered, the workers and the capitalists. The capitalists owned most of the factors of production, in this case, land and the capital to invest in factories. The workers just had their labor. So the class struggle here is between capitalists who want labor at the lowest possible price and the workers who want to be paid as much as possible for their work. There are two key ideas that underlie this theory of class struggle. First, Marx believed that production, or work, was the thing that gave life material meaning. Second is that we are by nature social animals. We work together, we collaborate, we are more efficient when we share resources. Marx's criticism of capitalism is that capitalism replaces this egalitarian collaboration with conflict. And that means that it isn't a natural system after all. And by arguing that capitalism actually isn't consistent with human nature, Marx sought to empower the workers. That's a lot more attractive than Blanqui's elitist socialism, and while purportedly Marxist states like the USSR usually abandon worker empowerment pretty quickly, the idea of protecting our collective interest remains powerful. That's where we'll leave it for now, lest I start reading from the Communist Manifesto. But ultimately, socialism has not succeeded in supplanting capitalism, as its proponents had hoped. In the United States, at least socialism has become something of a dirty word. So industrial capitalism certainly seems to have won out, and in terms of material well-being and access to goods and services for people around the world, that's probably a good thing. Ah, you keep falling over, you're a great bit, but a very flimsy one. Actually come to think of it, you're more of an 8-bit. But how and to what extent we use socialist principles to regulate free markets remains an open question, and one that is answered very differently in, say, Sweden than in the United States. And this, I would argue, is where Marx still matters. Is capitalist competition natural and good, or should there be systems in place to check it for the sake of our collective well-being? Should we band together to provide healthcare for the sick or pensions for the old? Should governments run businesses? And if so, which ones? The mail delivery business, the airport security business, the education business? Those are the places where industrial capitalism and socialism are still competing. And in that sense, at least, the struggle continues. Thanks for watching. I'll see you next week. Crash Course is produced and directed by Stan Muller. Our script supervisor is Danica Johnson.

So last episode, using just logic gates, we built a simple ALU, which performs arithmetic and logic operations, hence the A and the L. But of course, there's not much point in calculating a result, only to throw it away. It would be useful to store that value somehow, and maybe even run several operations in a row. That's where computer memory comes in. If you've ever been in the middle of a long RPG campaign on your console, or slogging through a difficult level on Minesweeper on your desktop, and your beloved dog came by tripped and pulled the power cord out of the wall, you know the agony of losing all your progress. Condolences. But the reason for your loss is that your console, your laptop, and your computers make use of random access memory on RAM, which stores things like game state, as long as the power stays on. Another type of memory, called persistent memory, can survive without power, and it's used for different things, but we'll talk about the persistence of memory in a later episode. We're going to start small, literally by building a circuit that can store one, single bit of information. After that, we'll scale up and build our very own memory module, and we'll combine it with our ALU next time, when we finally build our very own CPU. INTRO All of the logic circuits we've discussed so far go in one direction, always flowing forward. We've used the 8-bit ripple adder from last episode, but we can also create circuits that loop back on themselves. Let's try taking an ordinary OR gate, and feed the output back into one of its inputs and see what happens. First, let's set both inputs to zero. So zero OR zero is zero, and so this circuit always outputs zero. If we were to flip input A to one, one OR zero is one. So now the output of the OR gate is one. A fraction of a second later, that loops back around into input B, so the OR gate sees that both of its inputs are now one. One OR one is still one, so there is no change in output. If we flip input A back to zero, the OR gate still outputs one. So now we've got a circuit that records a one for us. Except, we've got a teensy tiny problem. This change is permanent. No matter how hard we try, there's no way to get this circuit to flip back from a one to a zero. Now let's look at the same circuit, but with an AND gate instead. We'll start inputs A and B both at one. One AND one outputs one forever. But if we then flip input A to zero, because it's an AND gate, the output will go to zero. So this circuit records a zero, the opposite of our other circuit. Like before, no matter what input we apply to input A afterwards, the circuit will always output zero. Now we've got the circuits that can record both zeros and ones. The key to making this a useful piece of memory is to combine our two circuits into what's called the AND OR latch. It has two inputs, a set input which sets the output to a one, and a reset input which resets the output to a zero. With set and reset both zero, the circuit just outputs whatever was last put in it. In other words, it remembers a single bit of information. Memory! This is called a latch, because it latches onto a particular value and stays that way. The action of putting data into memory is called writing, whereas getting the data out is called reading. Okay, so we've got a way to store a single bit of information. Great! Unfortunately, having two different wires for input, set and reset, is a bit confusing. To make this a little easier to use, we really want a single wire to input data, that we can set to either zero or one to store the value. Additionally, we're going to need a wire that enables the memory, either to be available for writing or lockdown, which is called the write enable line. By adding a few extra logic gates, we can build this circuit, which is called a gated latch, since the gate can be opened or closed. Now this circuit is starting to get a little complicated. We don't want to have to deal with all the individual logic gates, so as before, we're going to bump up a level of abstraction, and put our whole gated latch circuit in a box – a box that stores one bit. Let's test out our new component. Let's start everything at zero. If we toggle the data wire from zero to one, or one to zero, nothing happens. The output stays at zero. That's because the write enable wire is off, which prevents any change to the memory. So we need to open the gate by turning the write enable wire to one. Now we can put a one on the data line to save the value to our latch. Notice how the output is now one. Success! We can turn off the enable line, and the output stays as one. Once again, we can toggle the value on the data line all we want, but the output will stay the same. The value is saved in memory. Now let's turn the enable line on again, and use our data line to set the latch to zero. Done. Enable line off, the output is zero, and it works. Now of course, computer memory that only stores one bit of information isn't very useful. Definitely not enough to run Frogger, or anything really, but we're not limited to using only one latch. If we put 8 latches side by side, we can store 8 bits of information, like an 8-bit number. A group of latches operating like this is called a register, which holds a single number. And the number of bits in a register is called its width. Early computers had 8-bit registers, then 16, 32, and today, many computers have registers that are 64 bits wide. To write to our register, we first have to enable all of the latches. We can do this with a single wire that connects to all of their enable inputs, which we set to one. We then send our data in using the 8 data wires, and then set the enable back to zero. And the 8-bit value is now saved in memory. Putting latches side by side works OK for a smallish number of bits. A 64-bit register would need 64 wires running to the data pins, and 64 wires running to the outputs. Luckily, we only need one wire to enable all of the latches, but that's still 129 wires. For 256 bits, we end up with 513 wires. The solution is a matrix. In this matrix, we don't arrange our latches in a row, we put them in a grid. For 256 bits, we need a 16 by 16 grid of latches, with 16 rows and columns of wires. To activate any one latch, we must turn on the corresponding row and column wire. Let's zoom in and see how this works. We only want the latch at the intersection of the two active wires to be enabled, but all of the other latches should stay disabled. For this, we can use our trusty AND gate. The AND gate will output a 1 only if the row AND the column wires are both 1. So we can use this signal to uniquely select a single latch. This row and column setup connects all of our latches with a single, shared, right-enabled wire. In order for a latch to become right-enabled, the row wire, the column wire, and the right-enabled wire must all be 1. That should only ever be true for one single latch at any given time. This means we can use a single, shared wire for data, because only one latch will ever be right-enabled. Only one will ever save the data. The rest of the latches will simply ignore values on the data wire because they are not right-enabled. We can use the same trick with a read-enabled wire to read the data later, to get the data out of one specific latch. This means in total, for 256 bits of memory, we only need 35 wires. One data wire, one right-enabled wire, one read-enabled wire, and 16 rows and columns for the selection. That's significant wire savings. But we need a way to uniquely specify each intersection. We can think of this like a city, where you might want to meet someone at 12th Avenue and 8th Street. That's an address that defines an intersection. The latch we just saved our 1 bit into has an address of row 12 and column 8. Since there is a maximum of 16 rows, we store the row address in a 4-bit number. 12 is 1100 in binary. We could do the same for the column address. 8 is 1000 in binary. So the address for the particular latch we just used can be written as 11001000. To convert from an address into something that selects the right row or column, we need a special component called a multiplexer, which is a computer component with a pretty cool name, at least compared to the ALU. Multiplexers come in all different sizes, but because we have 16 rows, we need a 1-16 multiplexer. It works like this. You feed it a 4-bit number, and it connects the input line to a corresponding output line. So if we pass in 0000, it will select the very first column for us. If we pass in 0001, the next column is selected, and so on. We need one multiplexer to handle our rows, and another multiplexer to handle the columns. Okay, it's starting to get complicated again, so let's make our 256-bit memory its own component. Once again, a new level of abstraction. The 8-bit address for input It takes an 8-bit address for input, the 4 bits for the column, and 4 for the row. We also need write and read enable wires. And finally, we need just one data wire, which can be used to read or write data. Unfortunately, even 256 bits of memory isn't enough to run much of anything, so we need to scale up even more. We're going to put them in a row, just like with the registers. We'll make a row of 8 of them, so we can store an 8-bit number, also known as a byte. To do this, we feed the exact same address into all 8 of our 256-bit memory components at the same time. And each one saves one bit of the number. That means the component we just made can store 256 bytes at 256 different addresses. Again, to keep things simple, we want to leave behind this inner complexity. Instead of thinking of this as a series of individual memory modules and circuits, we'll think of it as a uniform bank of addressable memory. We have 256 addresses, and at each address, we can read or write an 8-bit value. We're going to use this memory component next episode, when we build our CPU. The way that modern computers scale to megabytes and gigabytes of memory is by doing the same thing we've been doing here – keep packaging up little bundles of memory into larger and larger and larger arrangements. And as the number of memory locations grow, our addresses have to grow as well. 8-bits hold enough numbers to provide addresses for 256 bytes of our memory. But that's all. To address a gigabyte, or a billion bytes of memory, we need 32-bit addresses. An important property of this memory is that we can access any memory location at any time, and in a random order. For this reason, it's called Random Access Memory, or RAM. When you hear people talking about how much RAM a computer has, that's the computer's memory. RAM is like a human short-term, a working memory, where you keep track of things going on right now, like whether or not you had lunch or paid your phone bill. Here's an actual stick of RAM, with 8 memory modules soldered onto the board. If we carefully opened up one of these modules and zoomed in, the first thing you would see are 32 squares of memory. Zoom into one of those squares, and we can see each one is comprised of 4 smaller blocks. If we zoom in again, we get down to the matrix of individual bits. This is a matrix of 128 by 64 bits. That's 8,192 bits in total. Each of our 32 squares has 4 matrices, so that's 32,768 bits. And there are 32 squares in total, so all in all, that's roughly 1 million bits of memory in each chip. Our RAM stick has 8 of these chips, so in total, this RAM can store 8 million bits, otherwise known as 1 megabyte. That's not a lot of memory these days, this is a RAM module from the 1980s. Today you can buy RAM that has a gigabyte or more of memory. That's billions of bytes of memory. So today, we built a piece of SRAM, Static Random Access Memory, which uses latches. And there are other types of RAM, such as DRAM, Flash Memory, and NV RAM. These are very similar in function to SRAM, but use different circuits to store the individual bits, for example, using different logic gates, capacitors, charge traps, or memristors. But fundamentally, all of these technologies store bits of information in massively nested matrices of memory cells. Like many things in computing, the fundamental operation is relatively simple. It's the layers and layers of abstraction that's mind-blowing, like a Russian doll that keeps getting smaller and smaller and smaller. I'll see you next week.

Squarespace. Share your passion with the world. What gives your life meaning? God? Love? Money? Work? Fanfiction? Football? Shopping? Sherlock? You might have your own personal sense of purpose in your life, or maybe you're hoping this course will help you find one. Or you might believe that you were created with a certain essence as a human being, with a purpose given to you by God. Whatever the cases, no one would fault you for wanting your life to have meaning. A sense of meaning is something that we all crave, maybe even need. And as we move out of our unit on the philosophy of religion, we should spend some time talking about how we understand our lives as being meaningful. Because when you think about it, a lot of us devote a ton of energy to the task of finding meaning in our lives. Maybe you find it through religion, or by fighting for social justice, or educating others, or seeking beauty in artistic expression. No matter how you do it, there's a group of philosophers, the existentialists, who say that any or all of these things can give your life meaning. But at the same time, they say none of them can. INTRO As you know by now, philosophy is about the dialectic. Someone puts forth an idea, and then someone else responds to it. Sometimes the response comes right away. In other cases, it takes thousands of years. Way back in ancient Greece, Plato and Aristotle took it as given that everything has an essence. A certain set of core properties that are necessary or essential for a thing to be what it is. If those properties were missing, then that thing would be a different thing. For instance, a knife could have a wooden handle or a metal handle, it really doesn't matter. But if it didn't have a blade, it wouldn't really be a knife anymore. The blade is the essential property of the knife, because it gives the knife its defining function. Now, Plato and Aristotle thought that everything has an essence, including us, and they believed that our essences exist in us before we're even born. So by this thinking, part of what it means to be a good human is to adhere to your essence. Now, you may or may not know what your essence is, and you might be great at living up to your essence, or you may be awful at it. But the important thing is that your essence gives you a purpose, because you were born to be a certain thing. This belief, known as essentialism, was the standard view of the universe all the way up until the late 19th century, and it's still accepted by many people today. But in the late 1800s, some thinkers started to challenge the idea that we are imbued with any essence or purpose. German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, for example, embraced nihilism, the belief in the ultimate meaninglessness of life. But by the mid-20th century, the path had been paved for French thinker Jean-Paul Sartre to return to the question of essence, and ask, what if we exist first? What if we're born without any hardwired purpose, and then it's up to us to figure out our own essences? Well, this became the framework for what we now know as existentialism, and its mantra is the claim that existence precedes essence. In other words, our existence, our birth, happens first, then it's up to each of us to determine who we are. We have to write our own essence through the way we choose to live. But we have no actual predetermined purpose. There's no set path that we're supposed to follow. It's hard to express how radical this idea was at the time. Because for thousands of years before this, you didn't have to choose a path or find your purpose. God did it for you. But it's important to note that existentialism is not synonymous with atheism. Plenty of existentialists are atheists, but some are theists, like Kierkegaard. What theistic existentialists deny is any sort of teleology. That is, they refute the notion that God made the universe, or our world, or us, with any particular purpose in mind. So God may exist, but instilling you, or your life, or the cosmos with meaning? That's just not in his job description. As a result, we are each born into a universe in which we, and our world, and our actions lack any real, inherent importance. This is a fundamental component of existentialism, and its adherents refer to it as the absurd. You and I think of absurdity as something that's just silly or preposterous. But for existentialists, absurdity is a technical term. It's how they describe the search for answers in an answerless world. We are creatures who need meaning, but we are abandoned in a universe full of meaninglessness. So we cry into the wilderness and get no response, but we keep crying anyway. That, for an existentialist, is the definition of absurd. Since there's no teleology, the world wasn't created for a reason, and it doesn't exist for a reason. If there's no reason for any of this, then there's also no absolutes to abide by. There's no cosmic justice, no fairness, no order, no rules. Now, existentialism has its roots in late 19th century thinkers like Kierkegaard and Nietzsche. But it really came into its own during and after World War II, as the horrors of the Holocaust led many people to abandon any belief in an ordered world. And who could blame them? When Nazis became possible, meaning became much harder to find. But Sartre faced meaninglessness head on, and explored one of the most agonizing aspects of existentialism. Not the world's lack of meaning, but its terrifying abundance of freedom. To most of us, freedom sounds pretty great, but Sartre thought that we are painfully, shockingly free. After all, if there are no guidelines for our actions, then each of us is forced to design our own moral code, to invent a morality to live by. Sartre took this to mean that we are condemned to be free, a fate that he found to be quite awful. You think that there's some authority you could look to for answers, Sartre said, but all of the authorities you can think of are fake. You can do what your parents say, or your church, or your government, but Sartre said those authorities are really just people like you. People who don't have any answers. People who had to figure out for themselves how to live. So the best thing you can really do, he determined, is to live authentically. Sartre used this to mean that you have to accept the full weight of your freedom in light of the absurd. You have to recognize that any meaning your life has is given to it by you. And if you decide to just phone it in and follow a path that someone else has set, whether it's your teachers, your government, or your religion, then you have what he called bad faith, a refusal to accept the absurd. If you live by bad faith, you're burying your head in the sand and pretending that something out there has meaning, meaning that you didn't give it. Which brings us to this week's Flash Philosophy. Let's go to the Thought Bubble. Sartre explained these ideas through an anecdote about one of his students who faced a difficult decision. He was at a crossroads in his life. He could join the military during wartime and go off and fight for a cause that he believed in. And he wanted to do this. He thought it was right. But he also had an elderly mother who was all alone except for him. If he went to war, he'd leave her behind, and that seemed wrong. So he could stay with her and let others fight for justice, or he could go off to war and leave his mother to herself, and likely never see her again. The young man felt a sense of duty to both his cause and to his mother, but he could only serve one. Moreover, if he went to war, he'd just be a very small part of a really big cause. His contribution probably wouldn't be great, but he would be contributing to something that would affect millions of people. But if he stayed behind, he'd make an enormous difference in just one person's life. Thanks Thought Bubble. So what's the answer? Sartre said the whole point of this young man's decision was that no one could give him an answer. In fact, there was no answer, until the man chose one for himself. No moral theory could help him decide, because no one else's advice could lead him to a decision that was truly authentic. So his choice, no matter what it was, was the only true choice, provided that he made it authentically, because it was determined by the values he chose to accept. A lot of people think existentialism paints a pretty bleak picture of the world. In fact, the French philosopher and novelist Albert Camus went so far as to say that the literal meaning of life is whatever you're doing that prevents you from killing yourself. But most existentialists would remind you that the world and your life can have meaning, but only if you choose to assign it. If the world is inherently devoid of purpose, you can choose to imbue it with whatever purpose you want. So no one can tell you if your life isn't worth anything if you, say, don't have children, or don't follow a lucrative career path, or achieve whatever standards your parents hold you to. And this works not just on an individual scale, but on a global one, too. If the world is going to have any of the things most of us value, like justice and order, we're going to have to put it there ourselves, because otherwise, those things wouldn't exist. But for you that looks bleak to some, may to others seem almost exhilarating. Today I hope you enjoyed as much as I did learning about essentialism and its response, existentialism. We talked about John Paul Sartre and his ideas about how to find meaning in a meaningless world. This episode was brought to you by Squarespace.

Yet, with just three letters from AAC and BBI to YYZ and ZZU, both me and you and our bags root around the world as unambiguously as practically possible. Airport codes! If you fly, you know them as part of the planning on your tickets, trackers, and tags, and even as part of the port itself as big, big branding. It's impossible not to wonder, bored on a long haul with only in-flight entertainment, about potential patterns peeking through, like all the Canadian Y airports. Why Canada? And why everyone? How do all these codes code? Well, neighbor, to find the answer, we need to divert this flight to YUL, the Canadian city that's capital of codes, Montreal, where is headquartered IATA, the International Air Transport Association. It's not a governmental organization, more an independent aviation agency for airlines, where they work to make airports and airplanes increasingly interoperable, using humanity's most exciting and powerful yet off-maligned as dull tool, standards. One of which is the IATA airport code, three letters to identify every airport in the world, from the most connected to the least. All are coded so companies can communicate clearly and concisely complicated connections to carry their customers and their bags. And actually, the code IATA created isn't only for airports, rather technically it's a location code for all kinds of transportation interchanges, like plane stations that connect to train stations such as Amsterdam Schiphol, which is just so intermodally epic. Okay, let's try not to get distracted by efficient infrastructure, easier said than done. Here's how the IATA code is supposed to work. One airport, one code, which is unique because airport names are not. Booking passage to Portland? Cool, that could be Oregon or Maine or Victoria, Australia. Ambiguity is the enemy. Airplane flying creates communication connections between every language on earth. So the IATA code helps when you don't speak Greenlandic or Odea but still need to book a flight to Kangar-lessac via Ba-Bains-war? I'm so sorry, Greenland and India. Instead of mongoling pronunciation, it's just SFJ via BBI. Much clearer, not just for you, but also for the ground crew getting the bags through. Ideally, the IATA code comes from the first three letters of the location, like with Gibraltar, Gibraltar Airport is given G-I-B, Gib-Gibraltar. So going to Cork it'll be C-O-R, Cor-Ireland. Oh, that didn't work. Seems Cordoba, Argentina built their airport first and got C-O-R ahead of Cork, so, uh, Ork for Cork. Tough Nuggies, Ork, Germany, that's an adorable town name you've got there, but you're going to need to pick something else for your code. Thus, a single code collision kicks off a consistency cascade as airports compete for clear codes. So if your local airport has an odd three letters, there's probably a rival port that picked previously. This is one of the major things IATA does, coordinate everyone's code preferences, which means dealing with not just individual airports, but all the aviation agencies in different countries, some with their own desires for intra-country code consistency, such as Canada, who clearly claimed all the Ys. Thus picking a Y1 at random, at least you know roughly where you're going to go. Oops, no, that didn't work. YKM brought us to Washington, USA, and since we're here, we might as well talk about the FAA. In America, the Federal Aviation Administration, daughter of the Department of Transportation, is given the job of assigning all American airports an American airport code. Yes, the FAA actually has her own set of three-letter codes, but we're not going to talk about it because it means in America there's one airport, two codes, and for simplicity, I'm sticking to this story. One airport, one code. Right? Right. Now FAA has letters she'd really rather American airports not. There's no N, Q, W, K, Z, or Y. N is reserved for the Navy for OMG, is it aircraft carriers? No, they use an unrelated and additional system that we're also not going to talk about. The Navy N is given to Navy bases with airports. So American airports like Nashville that seem like they should start with the letter N were encouraged to pick something else, like B for but Nashville. There is also A for the Army and the Air Force, although not all the As, so there's a bunch of A airports like Albuquerque, Aberdeen, Anchorage, Amarillo, and Augusta. Next Q FAA once avoided because of checks, notes, Morse code? Wow, really? There's a set of three-letter international Morse codes that begin with Q for quickie communications that are still used, I guess? So because of 1800s telegraph slang, American airports shouldn't start with the letter Q. Next K and W FAA advises against because FCC, the Federal Communications Commission, daughter of NO1, she's an independent agency, assigns K and W for U.S. civilian broadcast stations. So that thing where on the radio they say, K-mad, action news, or WDUL, public airwaves. Yeah, they all start with a K or W, which is actually location information. Ks are in the West and Ws in the East, except for the middle where it's both. FCC, why did you do it this way? Well, since you coded those codes first, FAA discourages airports from starting with those letters. Even though broadcast codes are four letters, not three, and they're, you know, radio stations, not airports, and definitely not weather stations. Of course they're not weather stations, why would you even say that? No reason, it won't come up later, don't worry. Moving on. Z is reserved for air route traffic control centers themselves, and why no why? Because Canada, of course. Yes, I understand, that's not an explanation, we'll get to it later. America's preferences for airport codes, but other countries exist, and their aviation agencies don't care at all which letters the United States avoids, so while Benashville was building her big big branding, NASA grabbed the N to get NAS for the Bahamian capital. There's no shortage of airport codes that start outside the US with America's reluctant letters. And also, because FAA's precedents aren't laws, you can find American exceptions, like New Keckwa, Yakquig, and Ziv. Boy, that was fun to say, let's end the video with more of that, shall we? And that new must particularly burn Newark, New Jersey, who had to go with Ework, Ewe Jersey instead. Right, finishing this thought, every country and their agencies has their own wacky preferences for letters and wants to ignore every other country's preferences, and IATA's job is to coordinate between them, the result of which is, IATA airport codes have no satisfying system at all, which is so sad for a standard. And the story of one airport, one code also falls apart even within IATA because of mega codes for mega cities. Example, London, which has six international airports, Heathrow, Gatwick City, Luton, Stansard, Southend, LHR, LGW, LCY, LTN, oh they all start with L? No, STN, SEN, but there's a mega code for them all, LON, which you can use while searching for flights landing in London but don't care where, even though these airports are ages apart. Then is the international city mega ist mega code but there's also Moscow, MOW, and Stockholm STO with four airports each, and more with two or three like NYC and BUE. And then code wise is the most exceptional airport, Euro Airport Baselmullhaus Freiburg, an airport so nice they coded it thrice, MLHBSL EAP. How this happened is, France and Switzerland both wanted an airport here-ish near the German border and teamed up, France provided the land, Switzerland the capital, Germany has nothing to do with this, and the pair co-built the port, constructing duplicate and separate everythings. So it was effectively two airports, run by two countries with two runways and two sets of rules and thus needed two airport codes depending on which side passengers could connect through and one mega code if it didn't matter. But all of this doesn't mega matter now because the two airports mostly act as one anyway, thus one airport three codes. And there are plans to run a railway through for epic intermodalness, so it could become one airport four codes or five codes, I mean why not at this point? So yeah, an airport isn't uniquely identified by one code and there's no location information coded in this location code, not even a checksum letter? What is this, a social security number? Without a checksum, if you were planning a flight to CGP airport in Bangladesh but typo the incorrect CPG, you'll end up in Argentina instead. Again. But at least the chance of a switcheroo like that must be pretty small. After all, a three letter code means 17,000 permutations, way more than the actual number of airports, which is only 40,000 airports worldwide? How can that possibly be true? Well, it's time to introduce you to IKO, the International Civil Aviation Organization, daughter of the United Nations, who also lives in Montreal with IATA. And it might seem like they're the same, but IATA actually only covers what we might call the standard commercial airports you'd find searching for flights normally, while IKO covers what she calls aerodromes, which is everything from the world's busiest passenger airport in the always unlikely-seeming Atlanta, Georgia, down to rarely used runways on ranches in Texas, of which there are an absolutely absurd number. So with all those aerodromes to account for, IKO uses four letters, which gives, wow, a lot more options, thanks exponentials, and she also uses the extra space to add location information. Finally! In IKO's system, the first letter of an airport code is roughly where on Earth it is. P is for airports in the Pacific, one letter to cover flying over the most terrifyingly empty half of the Earth, try not to think about it as you look down into the endless abyss before arriving at South America. S, then M for Middle America, and K for Continental America? C sensibly is Canadian America, and flying over the pole we get to U, for used to be USSR. Yes, that's actually the name. Look, what makes standards standards is their stubbornness. Just because a gigantic country collapsed is no reason to change what millions of flight computers know in their code and pilots in their brains. After IKO's first letter, there's also a bunch of second subletters, well, except for America and Canada, who skipped that, but don't worry. Moving on, as an example, if your airport starts with an F, it's in Southern Africa, and if the next letter is A, that's South Africa, and the last two letters are for the airport, so Cape Town gets Ct for a fact. Of course, there are some exceptions, like Antarctica, the continent no one owns, but all the cool kids want to claim. Aerodromes here are supposed to use the code for the country's claim they're in, such as Williams Field, which is American run, but uses NZWD because it's in the Kiwi claim. But also, lots of Antarctic aerodromes use pseudo-codes, no, we're not going to talk about what that means, which start with a T and end with a number, like 27, for Troll Airfield, serving Troll Research Station, which runs on Troll Time. Norway, is that you? I knew it was. But you really should be using EN for Europe-Norway, and TR is free. Enter Trolls, it's so perfect. And yes, the 27 means there are at least 26 other runways in Antarctica, I was surprised too, but this, along with all of the ranches, is how you get to crazy numbers of aerodromes. And yes, IKEO has more exceptions to this system that we're going to skip, but I can't resist just one more, which is Region J. Looking at the map, you won't be able to find it, because J is Mars. When the rover arrived at Jezero Crater, IKEO gave the historic landing location the code JZRO. Okay, but that's it for exceptions. So to sum up, the story of one airport, one code was just that, a story, tons of airports have at least two, and when they do, the IKEO code is what computers and pilots know to plan where the plane needs to go, and IATA is what passengers say to get on their way. But if IKEO exists with a more comprehensive code, why is IATA at all? So IATA isn't about you, it's about your bags. At an airport, you as a human walk to your connecting flight, but your bags below need a lot of logistical assistance. Before IATA, there was just like a handwritten tag saying, please get me where my owner is going, written in potentially every language on Earth, so you can't imagine how often that went wrong. So IATA used codes to make life better for bags, with bag tags with big clear codes to get those bags cleanly through connections across countries and companies. And the original plan was that train stations with IATA codes would also let you check in your bag there, and it would be part of the automatic connection too, but that mostly doesn't happen now because of logistical difficulties, which is the same reason that the IATA code is a club that excludes all the little aerodromes too annoying to attend to. So if your bag's final destination after connecting at Austin is one of the many random ranch airstrips, the ground crew is not going to swap your bags onto the tiny crop duster for you. Ditto if you're connecting through Argentina to Antarctica anywhere. Because tiny airports, no IATA code for you, and without an IATA code, your bag depends on you to get it all the way through. And that's what IATA is actually for. That big, big branding you see is for your bags, and because of the tag, it became what customers know, which brings us back to the start, and oh, sorry Canada, I know I've been avoiding answering the whys, but it's just so much more complicated than expected. There's a tale that the whys are an old system for if Canadian airports had a weather station. Y for yes, weather station, and W without. And since pilots want to know the weather, that explains all the whys, but also the few oddball Canadian Ws. But investigating the truth of that story took eight months of my life, which I will now give to you as an extremely compressed executive summary. Looking backwards, the American and Canadian IATA codes created in the 1950s come from the last three letters of IKEO codes created in the 1940s. The first letter of IKEO codes come from the ITU, the International Telecommunications Union's codes created in the 1910s for radio stations, which used K for America and CY for Canada. So K and CY into four letters, and back down to three leaves Y for Canada. Here is where you would reasonably ask why CY for Canada, but that goes all the way back to telegraphs and beyond, so is a story for another time. But for now, for this video, why Y for Canada? Because of radio call signs, because of a lot of other things, because of US and Canada coordinating that for flights within North America, it really would be Y for yes Canada, mostly. Well that was a lot of bureaucratic history, so let's finish with the final fun IATA codes promised from before, starting with Sioux City, with the sensible-looking SUX, until you say it out loud, but to her credit totally owns that branding for airport merch. Good for you Sioux. And there's also Beaches International Airport, Summer Break Central. Their top two picks for codes were picked, so to help the, uh, confused collegiates find their connections, the agencies agreed on ECP, to stand for Everyone Can Party, which is awesome branding, but you'd never know because Beaches doesn't bother. Geez ECP, you could learn a thing or two from Sioux. But now everyone can party on this round-the-world flight of IATA codes entertaining to say out loud. Ready? Fab!

On green, the first car accelerates, and then the next, and then the next, and then the next, and then you, only to catch the red. Had the cars accelerated simultaneously, you would have made it through. Coordination, not cars, is the problem, because we are monkey drivers with slow reaction times and short attention spans. Even if we tried, getting everyone to press the pedal on 3, 2, 1, now, would be challenging. This dis-coordination limits how many cars can get through an intersection, and when one backs up to the next, that's when city-sized gridlock cascades happen, taking forever to clear. In general, more intersections equals more dis-coordination, which equals more traffic. This is the motive behind big highways. No intersections. Splits and merges, yes. Intersections, no. No stopping, no coordination problems, no traffic. Well, that's the theory anyway. Intersections outside of a highway will back up onto it, again, because human reaction times limit how many cars can escape the off-ramp when the light changes. But, even without intersections, there would still be traffic on the highway. Traffic can just appear. Take a one-lane highway with happy cars flowing until a chicken crosses the road. The driver who sees it breaks a little, the driver behind him doesn't notice immediately and breaks a little harder than necessary, the driver behind him does the same until someone comes to a complete stop. And, oh look, cars approaching at highway speeds must now stop as well. Though the chicken is long gone, it left a phantom intersection on the highway. This is what's happened when you're stuck in traffic for hours thinking there must be a deadly pile up ahead and then suddenly the traffic's over with no wreckage in sight. To your relief, if you're a good person and mild annoyance if you aren't, you just pass through a phantom intersection, the cause of which is long gone. And this phantom intersection moves. It's really a traffic snake slithering down the road, eating oncoming cars at one end and pooping them out the other. On a ring road, a single car slowing down will start an erobarous of traffic that will last forever, even though there's no problem with the road. If the drivers could coordinate to accelerate and separate simultaneously, easy driving would return. But they can't, so traffic eternal. On highways, traffic snakes grow if cars are eated faster than excreted and they shrink if excreted faster than eated, dying when the last car accelerates away before the next car must stop. Now in multi-lane highways, there needs be no chicken to start gridlock. A driver crossing lanes quickly with cars too close behind is enough to birth a traffic snake that lives for hours in leagues. It's this quick crossing that causes drivers behind to overbrake and begin a chain reaction. But we can make traffic snakes less likely by changing the way we drive. Your goal as a driver is to stay the same distance from the car ahead as from the car behind at all times. Tailgating is trouble, not just because it makes accidents more likely, but because you as the tailgater can start a traffic snake if the driver ahead breaks. Always in the middle. This gives you the most time to prevent overbraking, but also gives the driver behind you the most time as well. And when stuck in traffic, this rule would get all cars to pull apart the snake faster. That's the simple solution to traffic, getting humans to change their behavior, perhaps by sharing this video to show how and why traffic happens, why tailgaters are trouble, and how we can work together to make the roads better for all. The end. Except, yeah. Wishing upon a star that people are better than they are is a terrible solution every time. Instead, what works is a structurally systematized solution, which is exactly what self-driving cars are. Self-driving cars can just be programmed to stay in the middle and accelerate simultaneously. They'll just do it. The more self-driving cars at an intersection, the more efficient the intersection gets. A solid lane of self-driving cars vastly increases throughput. Hmm, actually, if you ban humans from the road, which we should totally do anyway, you can get rid of the intersection entirely. After all, a traffic light is just a tool for drivers on one road to communicate with drivers on another, poorly and coarsely. Red equals don't go now, we are coming through the intersection. Green equals good to go. But self-driving cars can talk to each other at the speed of light. With that kind of coordination, no traffic light necessary. Just as with a highway, the best intersection is no intersection. Humans will never drive this precisely. At the intersection, the fundamental problem with traffic that you watch unfold, as with everything, is people. So the real simple solution to traffic is no more monkeys driving cars.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 843\n","\n","Link  269 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/boezS4C_MFc\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/boezS4C_MFc\n","[youtube] boezS4C_MFc: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] boezS4C_MFc: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 10.30MiB in 02:05\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  When the president dies, who becomes the president? Well, the Constitution says what happens next is the vice president assumes the powers and duties of the office. Simple enough, but one backup president is none backup president. So what happens next, next? The Constitution left this question as homework for the new Congress. Important homework, yes, due date, no. So Congress sort of worked on succession with inconsistent and conflicting drafts, but mostly procrastinated on properly finishing for 200 years, finally turning in the 25th Amendment. Better late than never, though in the meantime, a president had died in office not once, not twice, not thrice, not quadrice, not quintice, not hexice, nor septice, but octagonalice. Four natural causes, four assassinations. It was Garfield and McKinley. This survival record was only 80%, and even counting to today, the president is technically the most deadly job in America. But the odds are when you become president, you must roll the celestial 2d6, and if you roll a seven, you die in office. Woof, don't spend a lot of time in Vegas with those odds. So the Veep becomes the peep and picks a new Veep who must be confirmed by a majority vote of both houses of Congress. If this happens quickly, then hunky dory, everything is reset. But getting a VP nominee approved might take some time, during which the former VP, who is now the president, who is not immortal, must cast the dice and could roll a seven. The office of the vice president has been vacant for more than a baker's dozen of times in United States history, which given the historical state of Congress's homework at the time, put the peaceful transfer of power in a precarious position. For example, the first time a president died in office, the ninth by the way, didn't even make it to double digits, no one knew what should happen. The then VP just grabbed a judge to administer the oath of the presidency to become number 10, and spent the rest of his term arguing with Congress and the nation about if he was really the president president or the acting president. Which seems a little who cares what's the difference, but there is the office of the president and there are the powers and duties of the office, which are not quite the same thing. See, it's not just death that can remove a president. A president can resign, a president can be impeached, and a president can be enabled to discharge the powers and duties of the office. This last enable is from the constitution, which makes no attempt to define what enable means. A president can volunteer themselves to be enabled, for example, during physical illness, upon which they don't leave the office, but the VP gets the powers and duties of the office and becomes acting president. This, on a tiny scale, has happened a few times when the president has undergone non-trivial surgery, a reason for this being to ensure nuclear weapons command and control is maintained at all times. So don't get any ideas, but also you don't get any ideas, I'm still the president. Power reverts as soon as this is over, and it will, assuming death doesn't make a bedside visit. Anyway, inability is a subjective sliding scale. A president could be perceived as mentally enabled, by some, or become so mentally enabled as to be unable to declare themselves enabled, or become physically enabled, yet simply refuse to declare it. Here, the 25th amendment allows for the vice president to perform a kind of gentle coup. Okay, the president has 15 top-level advisors we will get to later. If the VP can get a majority of advisors to state in writing the president is enabled, the VP gets the powers and duties of the office. The president can challenge this, getting a moment to try and consolidate keys to power, but if the VP and advisors reaffirm the president is indeed enabled, the VP is acting president and a 21-day countdown clock begins. What happens next is up to Congress. If they do nothing, when the clock runs out, presidential power returns to the president. But if within the 21 days, Congress votes with a two-thirds majority that the president is enabled, then the vice president is permanently acting president. And the president is still around? Awkward. Obviously, this would be a real delicate maneuver for any VP to pull off, particularly as the president can dismiss their advisors for any reason, as long as the president holds the powers and duties of the office. So, getting advisors on board would be challenging. Case in point, in 1919, the president suffered a stroke and was mostly blinded and partly paralyzed. Don't worry, no big deal. The president just doesn't want to talk to the public or meet with his VP or consult with his advisors or leave the White House at all for a year and a half. And during this time, there was no move by the VP to declare the president enabled. But there might be a way around the VP. The 25th has this line about Congress appointing, like, its own committee to determine the president enabled. But the way it's worded is a little unclear. Does it mean the VP and advisors or Congress committee determine inability? Or does it mean the VP and advisors or Congress committee? If the latter interpretation, that means Congress alone has the power to appoint a committee with the power to remove the power of the president unilaterally. But as always with unclear interpretations, were they to happen for realsies, someone might want to weigh in on it. So those are the four or five ways a president can get removed from office. But one of them is clearly the most popular. So let's talk about what the finished congressional homework says about succession. First, the doubt that began with President 10 is dispelled by the 25th. When the president dies, the vice president becomes the president president. Enable equals VP acting president. Dead equals VP president president. But if both the president and the vice roll sevens, the order of succession is set. And first up is the speaker, who is the elected leader from within the House of Representatives. And next is the president pro tempore of the Senate, who is the longest serving senator. Not automatically, but elected by tradition. Gee, that's a funny thing to mention now. I'm sure it won't matter later. Senators tend to serve for a long time. So the president pro tempore is often in their 80s, with the record holder being 98. Just worth noting, it was up to Congress to set succession order. And Congress just so happened to pick the two most powerful members of Congress as next in line from the VP. After Congress, succession moves to the cabinet. These are the advisors mentioned before. Each here has the title of secretary and are secretary of a same-name department. Explaining each in detail would take too long, because it would be to explain the entire structure of the executive branch, which is enormous. And some of their names give you the idea, but some of them don't. For example, number four in line, the secretary of state, who runs the department of state, which has nothing to do with the states, but everything outside the states. The secretary of state is first in the cabinet, because managing the foreign relations of the federal government is a pretty big deal that requires you to be on at least decent speaking terms with other countries. A good thing should say you need their support during a sudden transition of power. The secretary of state is first among the founding four appointed by the first president. The others, secretary of treasury, secretary of war, and secretary of justice. Oh wait, fancy pants here, wants to be called the attorney general, but just so happens to be in charge of the department of justice. So the oldest departments have their secretaries in 4567 order of succession. Now from here, Congress decided the rest should continue on seniority, not for people, but departments. Which has led to an interesting order. Secretary of the Interior is next up because in the 1800s, young America realized she had a lot of interior land to manage and created the department of the interior to manage the land and the Indians on the land. No, there's no time. And land needs to be farmed and managed, so the department of agriculture. And then in 1900s, part one, America wanted to develop commerce and labor, and part two, health and human services and housing and urban development and oh right, transportation between those urban developments. Oh and energy for those developments and overseeing nuclear weapons. There really isn't time. And education. Meanwhile, that department of war, renamed department of defense, created veterans and so also the department of veterans affairs. All done until 2001, department of homeland security. So the order is more historical happenstance order, not legislators sat down and thought it through order. Not to cast shade on the secretary of education, but if something has happened where the first 15 backups are out of order, that sounds a lot like a homeland security issue. In addition to the debatable order, for everyone below VP, if their spot in succession comes up, they are required to resign their current position to become, wait for it, acting president. Most likely serving the rest of the president's term. Why most likely? Well, one of Congress's homework attempts raises an issue called bumping with this paragraph, saying the acting president serves the rest of the term unless a prior entitled individual is able to. Oh, it's another interpretation problem. This does or doesn't mean new appointees take priority and bump those lower on the list out of the office instantly. Here's the worst case interpretation and scenario. Imagine while Congress is on recess, the president VP both leaders of Congress and the secretary of state all roll sevens. The secretary of treasury becomes acting president and appoints a new secretary of state who is higher on the list, bumping the acting treasurer president off who is now unemployed, at least until reconfirmed. And of course, a new secretary of state is needed post haste confirmed. Back from recess, the Senate elects a new president pro tempore who is higher on the list and then must resign to become acting president, bumping the current acting president who was the secretary of state but is now just unemployed. And then the House elects their new speaker, bump again. While there is debate about bumping constitutionality, the point is it's still president 10 all over again. Uncertainty is the whole problem. After a government decapitation, just the potential of rapid fire changes in power is exactly what you don't want to be even debatable when nuclear command and control is on the table in what would obviously be trying times.

Every physics classroom has a solar system line like this, or like this. Sorry, Pluto. Looking at the line, which planet is closest to Earth? Venus or Mars? To answer, you need first know that, like many things in school, the line is a lie. Planets are not people queuing for coffee, but rather spheroids scattered in space, always in motion, not in simple circles either, but in ellipses at untidy angles. In the cold, dark expanse, this is the coziest Venus gets to Earth, but only about once a year and a half-ish. Starting close, she orbits far, then comes back, needs some space on the other side of the Sun. This means when Venus is away, Mars can be the closest to play. So because of orbits, there isn't one answer to who is the closest. It's really who is mostly the closest. The mostest closest. When Mars and Venus are both on the other side of the Sun, it leaves little Mercury the closest. Each of Earth's inner three planet friends are, at one time the farthest and the closest. And Mercury, with his smallest orbit, makes him never that far from Earth, at least on planetary scales, giving the little guy a uniquely close relationship with Terra. In fact, watching the planets spin, because of his small orbit, Mercury, not Mars or Venus, is the closest planet most of the time. Looking at the line, that seems impossible, but nonetheless, in the way of actual orbits, if we keep measuring the distance to all the planets as they spin, Mercury is Earth's mostest closest neighbor, which is delightfully unexpected. But wait, if Mercury is the mostest closest to Earth, he has to be the mostest closest to Venus as well, right? Because her orbit is smaller than Earth's. And running the numbers, it's true, making Earth's special relationship with Mercury less special. But at least this is one time where the line provides the obvious answer. Mercury is closest to Venus. While we're here, who is Mars' mostest closest? On his other side is the asteroid belt, so it should be Earth. But maybe it's Venus. Maybe the rule is the second closest is the mostest closest. Watching the results, and... Oh my Celestia, it's Mercury again. Mercury is the mostest closest to Earth, Venus, and Mars for the same reason each time. Bigger orbits make farther average distances for longer times. So mercurial Mercury is the constantest companion. No, no, it can't be true for Jupiter too. Enormous far away Jupiter. But it is! Once again, Mercury's small orbit means he never goes as far away as the other planets with their bigger orbits. Thus, are you ready for this? The orbital math that shows Mercury is the mostest closest to Jupiter is the same for all the planets and everything that orbits the Sun. You too, Pluto. For each of the planets, Mercury is the mostest closest.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 502\n","\n","Link  272 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/tk862BbjWx4\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/tk862BbjWx4\n","[youtube] tk862BbjWx4: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] tk862BbjWx4: Downloading webpage\n"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["ERROR: unable to download video data: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden\n"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Skipped 272\n","\n","\n","Link  273 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/z8B7rDsajus\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/z8B7rDsajus\n","[youtube] z8B7rDsajus: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] z8B7rDsajus: Downloading webpage\n"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["ERROR: unable to download video data: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden\n"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Skipped 273\n","\n","\n","Link  274 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/qD6bPNZRRbQ\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/qD6bPNZRRbQ\n","[youtube] qD6bPNZRRbQ: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] qD6bPNZRRbQ: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 17.92MiB in 06:20\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  While waiting on a plane during taxi till takeoff, looking out the window, you may have noticed the giant number numbering the runway, say 8, which implies 7 others exist, at least, but this is a flight out of LOL Airport, in Nevada's desert of nothing. There's only two runways, which, given the passenger load, seems like maybe one too many already? What's the deal with runway numbers, you might wonder aloud? Oh, hello again! Flying to Nook as well, are you? It is a long flight, so there's tons of time for me to tell you all about runways. Let's begin. So, before you can number a runway at an airport, you need to build the airport, and before you can build the airport, you need to plan the port, and what needs figuring first is which way to run the way. Pilots want runways with winds in parallel for physics reasons that we are going to skip, both because lift physics is something people really like to argue about, and this isn't a physics video. Yeah, I'm recording a runway video right now, hope you don't mind. But the summary is, planes take off and land into the wind because it lets them use less runway, and makes for safer and stabler landings in particular. Now, planes can land with winds unaligned, but it's unsettling to watch these crosswind attempts as pilots do their best to face into the wind while landing on a runway that does not. Oof. So, airports too want winds running with the runway, but the universe is indifferent to human desires, wind winds as it wants, so the simple solution in aviation early days was to build a triangle of runways, put up a little windsock, and direct the pilot to the runway that paralleled the sock and thus the wind. But as aviation grew, so did airplanes, and thus their runways, making the triangle trick impractical for big urban internationals. But the simple sock still solved it. See, if you record when and which way the windsock blows and with what wind force, you've grown yourself a windrose, a clever little data viz tool with the sock in the center of compass points for orientation and bars colored in size for strength and frequency of wind. Though, it reads opposite actually of everyone's expectations, with the lines showing the way the wind blows from and not to. Physics stuff just loves to opposite actually. Let's just agree to avoid physics for this video, shall we? Windroses reverse readings aside, they reveal that in most places, most of the time, most of the wind mostly blows back and forth in one direction. So that's surprisingly convenient. Thanks indifferent universe. Oh, you did it for other reasons? Well, still, this convenient wind happens because wind is a current of air, transporting heat from where there's more to where there's less. The Earth is blasted by the nuclear heat of the sun, with the equator getting hit hot hardest, making hot air rise there as it cools out along the edge of space before coming back down, creating a big scale convection current that repeats in a pattern all up and down. And because the Earth is a sphere that spins, those cylindric convection currents of air on the surface twist clockwise north of the equator and counter below. This is the Coriolis effect, creating coiled currents of air everywhere, which is cool. But also physics trying to sneak back into the video, and this isn't a physics video. All that matters is this creates the pretty stable pattern of trade winds, and if you're planning a port, you need only know which way does the wind mostly blow. Though at some locations, the windrose reveals two frequent directions of wind, so if you want to constantly and safestly keep open the airport, you're going to need to run a second way. This is why many airports have an X or V layout like LOL. They're not necessarily doing double the traffic of a one-runway port, but rather have double the chance of crosswinds when the tower will need to reroute pilots toward the other alignment for safer landings. And once you have two of something, you need names or numbers. Sure, you could just go with run one and run two, but pro tip, try never to use the very first thing that comes to mind without giving it a bit of a ponder first, and the windrose reveals a better way with the compass points, which form a circle of 360 degrees, starting at 0 north, east 90, south 180, west 270, and back to north makes it 360 as well. These compass degrees come from ships of the seas, because captains and quartermasters, when in the vast, featureless nothing, could still count on their compass to point toward the north pole, assuming no iron hooks happen nearby, and with north as a fixed navigational point could then communicate their heading with names broadly, east, south, east, or numbers precisely, helm to 108. Quite handy! So it's no surprise these compass headings got passed from seaships to airships. Thus on the windrose devised plans for any airport, the runway is already aligned with navigational numbers begging to be used. But before grabbing the obvious one, again, ponder for a moment. The runway points from the perspective of the port toward the plane. The rather more important heading to use is from the plane's perspective approaching the port, which on the plan is at the opposite end actually, because it's what number matches the compass in the cockpit that's critical. Alright, this needs a couple of example airports. Take one with a north-south runway. When the wind blows from the north to the south, the tower directs pilots to approach from the south, meaning they need to point the plane north, which on their compass is a heading of 360 degrees. So let's put a big 360 on that end for now. When the winds reverse, the tower directs pilots to approach from the north to fly south, which reads 180, so let's put a big 180 on that end as well. Now that we've got our heading numbers, the convention is to round them to 10 and cut off the 0 for the runway number, because we don't need three sig figs of precision when airports have single-digit numbers of runways, and the very stressed air traffic controllers in the tower need to repeat precisely these numbers hundreds of times a day, so saving syllables here really matters. Thus, when the tower tells the plane to use runway 36, the pilot knows they need to get south of the airport to land facing north, and while there are like a million indicators in a cockpit, the pilot can always confirm they're doing it right by reading 360 on their ancient ancestor's compass. This low-tech check is useful as a fallback, because a compass can see the way even when eyes and other equipment cannot. As a two-runway example, an airport with a perfect ordinal X would get numbered thusly. Northwest to southeast gives 315 for one end, because that's the way the pilot needs to point, and 135 at the other. Round to 10 for 320 and 140, then drop the zeros to get runways 32 and 14. On the other side, 225 and 45, round to 10 again, drop the zeros for 23 and 5. Now, when the towers talk to the pilots, they say each digit individually, so runway 23, because clarity here is critical, which is also why the font and exact size of these digits is standardized worldwide. Though there are disagreements between the abundant aviation agencies as to if single-digit runways, like 6, should have a leading zero for clarity, or if that leading zero should only be in our hearts. Which it shouldn't be. Anyway, that's the surprisingly good system behind numbering these numbers, which is always a delight to discover, unlike some other numbers I could mention. Though there are a couple of wrinkles. For, think about it, if the wind mostly blows back and forth in most places, then most big, busy, urban international airports will need multiple runways in parallel. But parallel runways have the same heading, thus the same number under this system, which would be unclear for pilots to say the least. So all the agencies assembled to agree. If you have two parallel runways, they will have the same number, but add an L or an R for left and right. If you need to construct a third runway, add a C for center, too. But with four or more, two runways will get the correct heading number with L and R, but the others, they're going to get the next closest numbers, but not exactly correct numbers. Which is practical, I suppose, but also, ah, it's all slightly misaligned. It's big airports. Like, it doesn't line up. Like, just try not to think about it, okay? Just try not to think about it. Oh, we're landing at Nook already? Wow, flights fly fast when you're flapping about flying. Time to put this knowledge to use. Our compass heading reads 42 degrees, so round to 10, 440, cut the zero and we'll be landing on runway 04. And since there's only one runway at Nook, it'll be perfectly aligned. No doubt about that. Oh, it's five, not four. How embarrassing. I guess I need to delete this video now. Hey, why are you painting a new runway number? You do that every few decades? That must mean, oh, runway numbers depend on where the North Pole is. And so watch out, there's a geography video inside this video called Where is the North Pole Really? Okay, to find the North Pole, remember that the Earth is a sphere that spins. Oh, sorry, we already went over that. We draw a line about which this spin occurs and name each end the North and South Pole. Starting with these poles, we clever humans created a square-ish coordinate system for our spherical Earth, the detailed creation of which I'm going to skip because that's a physics story for a never-time that took hundreds of years and needed lots of clocks and to make it official that London rules and Paris drools. But anyway, this grid is what every modern navigational system uses to get around with the GPS global positioning coordinates it gives. But if you were to use your GPS to direct you to the North Pole so that you could experience the planet rotating you in place as the stars circled overhead and you pondered the scale of the indifferent universe and your tiny, tiny existence within it, if you took out your compass to double-check that the GPS got the spot right, the compass points you over the horizon toward another North Pole. What gives compass? Well, what did you expect? A compass is a magnet, and magnets follow magnetic fields. That's like their only thing? It's not a math magnet. Your magnet compass will take you to the gigantic magnetic field spewing forth from inside the Earth. So there are two North Poles, one for math and one for magnets. I mean, I guess if you want to be technical about it, there are three North Poles because the magnetic field the North Pole of a magnet points to is the South Pole of the Earth's magnetic field because opposites attract. But look, we're just going to ignore that because this isn't a physics video and there's been enough, oh it's the opposite actually already, and yes, I know you can define more Norths. But we're moving on. There are two Norths, math and magnets. The compass points to the magnetic North and the GPS points to the geographic North. They don't have anything to do with each other, but for navigation humans have used both. One isn't better than the other, though math slash geographic North is now often called true North, which feels a bit like humans picking the new one as their favorite one. Oh, and ships of the seas have stopped using the old magnetic North and now navigate with GPS using the true North, even modern pirates, but planes and pilots still love the traditional magnet North. And we can stop thinking about this because they're pretty close anyway. Although, isn't that kind of weird just how close the unrelated poles are on a planetary scale? Earth just so happens to have a giant magnet that sort of but not quite lines up with the planet's top and bottom? In different universes, are these things secretly related? And still, why would runway numbers change just because they're pointing at the magnet one, but not the math one? Oh no, there really is an unavoidable physics video inside this geography video, and it's called Magnets. What's your deal? Okay, we really can't cover everything about magnets because it's just so much, but some bits of some metal such as iron generate around them a magnetic field. Why and how were a mystery for a long time until we discovered that if you take a wire and run a current of electrons through it, aka electricity, this current also generates a magnetic field around the wire. But weirder, if you start with a current of electrons and pop them in a magnetic field, the current will curve. And oh look, you've stumbled upon a clue to one of the fundamental secrets of the universe. Magnets and electricity are two expressions of the same thing, electromagnetism. That's why in science class, you can coil up a wire, send a current of electricity through it, and the whole thing becomes a magnet. One you can make stronger and stronger with each additional coil, because curving currents are magnets, which is why when you cut the current, everything drops. Our just iron magnets are doing the same thing, but you need to zoom down and down and down and down to the atomic level to see. Here, an atom of iron has a cloud of electrons, each electron with a charge, and as they whirl around, they create a tiny current and a tiny magnetic field. Zooming even closer, each electron spins, and this spin acts like the universe's tiniest tiniest current, creating the tiniest tiniest electromagnet. Okay look, whirl around and spin don't mean what you think down here, because in the land of quantum, words mean nothing. There is only math that we're not gonna do, so just go with it. Anyway, in most atoms, all these current created tiny magnetic fields arrange themselves against themselves, so it all cancels out to nothing. But in a rare few atoms like iron, does there happen to be an imbalance that aligns and adds up? And thus, each iron atom is a tiny magnet, and if adjacent atoms align, their little magnetic fields add up. And zooming out and out and out, if all the atoms in the iron are aligned, then the iron acts as one big monkey-sized magnet. But deep down inside, it's just electron-sized electromagnets. And scaling up and up and up and up to the whole Earth's magnetic field, it's an electromagnet all over again. See, the Earth is made of parts, the thin perilous cool crust on which we live, the inner solid core that is several thousands of degrees hot, a middle mantle mostly solid and relatively cool, and critically, a ring of metal liquefied by the hot, hot core. And just as on the surface do hot spots cause convection currents of air to try to even the energy out, so too does the unbelievably hot inner core cause convection currents of liquid metal, metal that happens to be mostly iron, our magnetic friend. Thus, as this mixture circles, so do all its electrons, curving currents, which gets us magnetic fields, baby! Though, as individual coils, it's not very strong to start. To get a planet-sized field, you'd need to somehow stack the coils, which is where the Coriolis Effect comes back in. For just as Earth spin causes convection currents of air into coils, so too does Earth spin cause convection currents of liquid metal to coil, making the fields stronger, turning the whole of the Earth into a giant electromagnet. Wow! If there's one thing the indifferent universe loves, it's repeating the same patterns across scales and domains. Such austere efficiency. It's beautiful. Oh, get back to the runways. Ohhhhh! Unlike a real electromagnet made of stable metal, all that swirling liquid iron inside Earth is not stable. So at any moment, the field can split into multiple magnetic poles, roam randomly, or diminish entirely before, oh my, flipping north to south and south to north, which it does every couple hundred thousand years or so, and we have no way of predicting when. Great. That'll cause some trouble. And there's a clue that it's coming, because the strength of Earth's magnetic field has dropped 10% over the last couple hundred years, which is concerning. So, uh, if you're watching this video after the flip, one, take everything I said about magnetic north and magnetic south, and now it's the opposite, actually, and two, if it's been a couple hundred thousand years since my last upload, don't worry, that's about normal, so be sure to smash that subscribe button so you don't miss the next video. Oh, and hit the bell. God, I hate that you have to do that now. All right, time to wrap this up. First, this giant electromagnet made of liquid metal Coriolis-convecting inside Earth only semi-stably means Earth's magnetic field moves. That finishes with the physics and means the magnet north pole moves, and quite a lot on human timescales. When we started measuring, it was safely inside of Canada, but it's recently rocketed north. Geography over, so we can finally get back to the start. Since runway numbers are derived from the heading on a compass, when the magnet north moves, the runway numbers need to change to match, and the closer your airport is to a magnet pole, the bigger a difference its movement makes, and thus the more frequently you need to update the number, which is why it's no surprise that Canada, with more northern runways than anyone, was the first to get pretty tired of frequently repainting all her northern runways, and so changed her system to be based on the unmoving math north instead, but this means when flying over her territories, pilots can't count on their compass to match the runways and the winds. They can use their GPS, assuming the battery is charged, but these runway numbers are inconsistent with runways in the whole rest of the world. Now, Canada thinks her system is better, and has created an aviation agency to try to convince all her international friends, with airports more equatorial, and thus less of this problem, to try and switch with her from the old and busted magnetic north to the new true north. If pirates can do it, why not planes too? Yar! Well, because it's mostly a problem for you, and thus there's not one system for numbering runways, but two. Hey guys, if you are going to switch to true north, best to get it done like, before the poles flip? Just sayin'.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 3262\n","\n","Link  275 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/4AivEQmfPpk\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/4AivEQmfPpk\n","[youtube] 4AivEQmfPpk: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 4AivEQmfPpk: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 5.26MiB in 01:18\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  How many countries are there? Easy, just grab a map and start counting, yes? No. Not all maps are created equal. Borders will differ depending on who you got that map from. So if individuals disagree, then surely a committee will save the day. Go to the United Nations, find the room where the countries sit, each with a little name tag, start counting, and get an answer. Now, of course, countries come and countries go, but at the time this video was made, the answer is 193. Fastest video ever, right? Except, you know, this isn't over. The United Nations list is less a complete class roster than a club membership that doesn't include everyone. Take Vatican City, who is a country, but is too cool for school when it comes to being a member of the United Nations. And while Vatican City's exact situation is complicated, he's straightforward compared to other non-United Nations countries, or places. The terminology is going to have to be a bit unclear here. Take Kosovo, who wants to join the UN club, but membership requires none of these five countries to reject you. And while the United States, the United Kingdom, and France think Kosovo is a country, Russia and China think she's just a rebellious part of Serbia, and so veto her membership. As for everyone else, just over half recognize Kosovo as independent, and Kosovo, adorably, has a website where she thanks each one in their own language. But Kosovo is not the only other place that wants to be considered a real country. There's Transnistria, the Nagorno-Karabakh Republic, Abkhazia, and South Ossetia, which might or might not be part of Moldova, Azerbaijan, or Georgia, depending on who you ask. Two of these countries, no UN member recognized as countries, and the other two have only five supporters, though all four of these places recognize each other as countries. There's also the Surari Arab Democratic Republic and Northern Cyprus, each with their own supporters. At this point you might be thinking, okay, seriously, what's the deal? I don't care who these guys think are countries, are these places countries or not? If I fly to one for a holiday, will it look like a country when I get there? The answer is maybe. These countries are all autonomous to some extent, with governments that issue passports, though these may be of rather limited use, and depending on which ones you're visiting, they may have more or less control of the territory they claim as theirs. You won't always find a clear border. What makes many of these places fuzzy is that they're usually born of conflict in the recent-ish past. That answer is probably less helpful than you want, so think of it like this. While the United States is clearly a country now, in 1776 not so much. Then she was just an idea in the minds of rebel scum. She wasn't recognized as a country instantly and without diplomatic effort to change that young America would never have made it on her own. Much like what happened a century later when she got her own rebel who, unlike elder sister, failed in the diplomacy department, so yeah. And so it goes today with many of the maybe countries in the world. Maybe their future United States and maybe their future confederacies, but in the moment it's hard to say because these things can take decades to settle. By the way, these maybe countries are super awkward for countries to deal with. While your tiny island nation might not want to get involved in the affairs of distant lands, you still have to decide to send a diplomat or not, meaning even inaction forces you to pick a side in every territorial skirmish in the world. A notably awkward case being Taiwan, er, sorry, Chinese Taipei, which is totally part of China and no one would ever think otherwise. Is China gone? Okay, by any reasonable definition Taiwan is a separate country and has been for years, but China won't let go and insists you call her Chinese Taipei. And don't forget who makes all your clothing and utensils and phones and computers and everything. So almost all countries, including the mighty United States, play along even though they unofficially acknowledge Taiwan's independence and do things that wouldn't make sense otherwise, like sending aircraft carriers to protect one part of China from another part of China? Thus the innocent question, how many countries has led us straight to a big World War Three press here to start button, which is getting depressing, so let's move on to... Oh, right. No more politics. On to higher ideals. The Olympics. Surely from their perch among the gods, they have a disinterested view of the countries below. How many are there, Olympics? 204. Huh. So Olympics is a bit special. She defines Puerto Rico as a country, even though it's unambiguously part of the United States, as well as Bermuda and Aruba, which are connected to the UK and the Netherlands, along with a bunch of other places that are happy to play in her Olympic games as nations, but make no claims to independence. Presumably, Olympics includes these to bump up the number, so she can say more than 200 countries compete, though even her inflated list doesn't include Vatican City, because given his demographics, divine intervention would be required to take home a gold. And Vatican City brings us right back to the core of the difficulty with this question. A consistent definition of country is impossible, because your checklist needs to include both Vatican City, the least country-like country that's still a country, and also exclude the anti-Vatican city, Hong Kong, the most country-like country that isn't. Also, don't forget from previous episodes, the seemingly endless territories, which look and act like independent countries, but just sort of aren't, and this isn't even bringing up the various nutters who plant a flag on an island or an oil rig, start printing currency on their fancy inkjet, and declare Dilutopia a new nation. So with no checklist to follow, where does that leave us? The best answer to the question, how many countries for the foreseeable future, is probably to say around 200, and leave it at that. An answer with more significant figures implies more agreement than there really is, because ultimately, what makes a country a country is if other countries think that country is a country.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1088\n","\n","Link  276 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/qEV9qoup2mQ\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/qEV9qoup2mQ\n","[youtube] qEV9qoup2mQ: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] qEV9qoup2mQ: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 19.94MiB in 04:39\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Ta-da! It's a video about Tiffany. I hope you like it. Psst. Hey, hey, would you like to know more? Okay, great. So listen, I need to tell you about this poem. Come with me behind the scenes where I've been working on this for... I don't even know how long. Take a seat. Get comfortable. It all began with these articles I read saying the name Tiffany is very old, maybe medieval. What a cute and easy video, past Grey thought. And it could have been, it could have been, if I'd just left things alone. But no, I wanted to read the article sources, which turned out didn't often contain the name Tiffany at all, but rather the ye olden name Theophania, or the super old Theophanu. And like, maybe these medieval ladies called themselves Tiff, but that's just a bit too cute, isn't it? To me it looked like the sort of Lady Godiva story where later writers say a thing happened, but there's no evidence from the time that it did, because it's a fairy tale. And the mind history is full of once you go looking. Don't go looking. So for a while the Tiffany video teared on the edge of getting binned, but it turned out my Lady Godiva suspicions were wrong when some medieval Tiffany's did turn up to save the project. But the poem happened before that, and listen, I need to tell you about it, otherwise I might just explode trying to contain all the excruciating details and number of obsessive hours poured into this ffff poem, and I can't let it all have been for nothing. Okay, ready? No? Too bad, here's the poem. William DeConnesby came out of Brittany with his wife Tiffany and his maid Manfass and his dog Hardagrass. It's okay, that's it. But what isn't okay is that this poem popped up in modern writings implying it's proof that Tiffany is maybe medieval, but never with the poem's date or an author attached, making it impossible to pin to a timeline, which made the poem annoying, doubly so because it's supposed to be a joke. Like, here it is in this 1859 history book with this weird French-style humorous illustration, but I don't get it, is it the name of the dog? What's the joke? If you get it, please leave a comment, I just, I need to know. Anyway, when you're reading about a topic, this is the sort of thing that happens a lot. There's some detail you keep stumbling over and over, and it could be the critical clue. I'm looking for the earliest Tiffany A&Y, there's a Tiffany A&Y right here, maybe the very first if I could just pin the poem to its proper place, but no. I had just resolved to give up on this poem when the Tiffany's of America arrived at my door, which I had ordered weeks ago to hopefully help with the main Tiffany video, but it was just 90% a literal list of people named Tiffany in America with hilariously unclear photos. The book was written by Nelson Otis Tiffany and thanks Charles Lewis Tiffany for making the book possible with his liberal contributions of money. I love how explicit that is. Then totally unrelated, there follows a description of how the Tiffany family crest is the most beautiful thing of its kind we have ever seen, and then two pages of the densest family flattery ever put in print. But in between those two sections to mock me, the poem appeared again, without a date, but with a footnote path to follow. This is the moment I broke and swore to the gods above and below I would find the primary source of this Brittany Tiffany poem no matter the time, no matter the cost. And when you give that to the gods, they, of course, played a joke upon Grey, making his pursuit of this poem as painful as possible. Here's what happened. The Tiffany's of America got the poem from Richmondshire, its ancient lords and edifices, which I ordered and when it arrived found the full title to be Richmondshire, its ancient lords and edifices, a concise guide to the localities of interest to the tourist and antiquary with short notices of memorable men. I opened it and out fell an old map, which is a thrilling moment no matter what's mapped on the map. After checking for spots marked X back to the book to find the poem, which had a pencil highlight mark and a note below, it seems whoever owned this book before me was also on their own poetic Tiffany journey. Maybe it was Nelson Otis Tiffany. I don't know. So, Richmondshire, its ancient lords and edifices, a concise guide to the localities of interest to the tourist and antiquary with short notices of memorable men, list the poem as from the author M. Thierry. Now, buying old, rare books gets expensive real fast, so I headed down to my local library to try and track M. Thierry down, which took a while because one, I didn't know then, but I do know now that M. is an old abbreviation for Mr. and the author referenced was Mr. Augustine Thierry and his book, The History of the Conquest of England by the Normans. And two, my library predates the Dewey Decimal System, which makes every book search an adventure through 17th century organizational idiosyncrasy, which is delightful when you're browsing, but infuriating when you're in the wrong section about England and you can't find the book you're looking for because you should be in the England only section, but not here behind the little book elevator. Anyway, Thierry's book was on the shelf. I grabbed it, sat down with it, and flipped through the pages to find the poem. And that History of the Conquest of England by the Normans isn't the primary source either, pointing to Hearn Pradiff ad John de Fordham, Scottichronicon? Okay, what's the Scottichronicon? According to Wikipedia, it's a history book of Scotland, started in the 1300s by a priest in Aberdeen and continued after his death by an abbot in Inchcombe. These historians worked to cover the history of Scotland from their present day back to the literal Genesis, a rather epic undertaking deserving the epic name the Scotchonomachron. Fun fact, this book is one of the earliest references to Robin Hood, though the authors take a rather more dim view of the Hood and his hoi polloi fans than most modern interpretations. According to them, then arose the famous murderer Robin Hood from among the disinherited, whom the foolish populace are so inordinately fond of celebrating. Interesting, but I didn't come to the library to track down the earliest reference to Robin Hood. It's a Piers Plumb and Poems, by the way. I'm here to find the Scottichronicon in the Scotland history section, which is in the dark. Sure glad my phone has a flashlight. There it is. The Scottichronomicon. Oh, look at all these handwritten notes. Last time this was checked out was 1995. Alas, there was no poem on page 172, but maybe that page number was for a different edition, so there was nothing to do but start flipping and skimming, flipping and skimming, over and over and over and over and over and over, through every single crinkly page to find the Brittany Tiffany poem nowhere. Maybe the poem was among those pages, and I just missed it. I mean, the book is in Latin. It turned out not. I didn't know it at the time, but I did have the wrong edition, but in an unexpected way. This one printed in MDCCLIX, but if you were to search further, say, at the largest library in the world, with 200 million volumes, you could find an earlier edition printed in MDCCXXII, which was both much smaller and with hilariously large font, like the author was trying to puff up the book, but in this one on page 170, there she was. Brittany Tiffany A&Y. I was thrilled to have found truly medieval evidence of Tiffany. I had the primary source. I could pin the poem to the 1400s. Or so I thought, until I remembered that these guys wrote in Latin, and this poem is in modern-ish English. How could that be? Well, it's because this poem isn't in the Scotch-a-Chronicon at all. It's a footnote added by the editor of this 1722 edition, and it's also not the primary source, the editor adding, In an ancient writing of parchment kept charrily by the family of the Connorsby among their records, they have this written. Charrily? That's an old word that means cautious or warily? That's weird. And ancient? How ancient? Fast-forward past much time spent searching Connorsby family records without luck. Though, of course, now that I'm talking about this, I know some long descendant of the Connorsby clan will show up at my door with a relinquary box and the poem inside, which I'll need to send off for some radiocarbon dating. And I also know that every example of an old Tiffany A&Y will be sent to my door forevermore. But that's future Grey's problem. For current Grey, well, now past Grey at the time of writing and research, the one path the gods had directed before me I wish I had not followed through. Who is Theo Hernius the editor? Well, to find out, step one is to find his non-Latinized name, Thomas Hearn. Thomas Hearn was...eh, well, we'll get to that. But he worked at the Bodleian Library at Oxford in the early 1700s and published lots of editions of medieval texts, Scott O'Kromakon among them. Now, trying to find more information about why someone wrote a footnote 300 years ago seemed hopeless. But Google, against all odds, turned up the collected letters of Alexander Pope, a contemporary of Hearns in England who wrote a 35-page letter about Hearn that begins, \"...that he may never be forgotten, who has raked the repositories of antiquity and has been indefatigable in fetching learning from places where many would not have sought after it, a few memorials of his life and some observations on his writing will, we hope, redound to his credit.\" Which at first sounds like, wow, what a fan, and this 35-page letter by Alexander Pope happens to mention the Brittany Tiffany poem, though in a context that seems...off? Saying Hearn had so many, not just historical documents, but poems in particular, that it would waste your time to tell you about all of them. Pope then says Hearn wanted to be useful by saving them all, but then lists several clearly useful-to-no-one-ever poems, including Brittany Tiffany. It's just sort of weird, and I would have left it at that. Should have left it at that. But then this passage caught my eye. We have taken the liberty to correct some few mistakes in Hearn's writing, and been careful not to offend any impartial reader. We have avoided flattery on one hand and scandal on the other. That's a very I don't love drama sentence from Pope, isn't it? I'm just somehow always at the center of drama. Oh, this burn book? It's nothing. Just where I write down my ideas for plays. I'm a literal dramatist, you know. Pope then goes on to fill his 35-page letter with nothing but corrections for every mistake Hearn ever made in all of his work in this infuriating, oh, let me just help you out Hearn kind of way. Some observations on his writing, indeed. Hearn gets a date wrong, and Pope says, I'm sorry, Hearn. See, here, where you wrote 1274, you have either not kept up with your avowed regard for truth, or unhappily blundered in a point of chronology. You say this man in 1274 studied at Canterbury College, and he wrote about it, but I'm afraid to tell you, the college was not built until 1363. Therefore, this man must have either lived 89 years before he was born, or written of a place many years before it was built. Oh, Hearn, now, don't be annoyed. These corrections, how much so ever they may look like ridicule, are undoubted confirmations of your industry, and will ever be thought so by persons of deeper penetration. Me? Yow! Alexander Pope, it turns out, is the human who coined the phrase, damning with faint praise. Of course, only after reading the entire letter did I realize I could have skipped it, had I first seen Pope hanging out on the bottom of Hearn's Wikipedia page, calling Hearn's life work unappealing and monkish. Hearn complained into his diary that Alexander Pope, one of the most quoted authors in the English language just below Shakespeare and the Bible, lacked scholarship. Alexander Pope, in turn, created a character for one of his plays based on Hearn named Wormius, a know-nothing, know-it-all pedant. Hearn shot back, saying Pope's play was a scurrilous piece against many of the greatest men of the age. This delicious beef was the only highlight of my reading, so I needed to know more. But putting plus Hearn plus Wormius into Google returned exactly one result, the Wikipedia page itself, which is super sus. I mean, does information even exist if it's not on the internet? Oh right, of course. So I had to check the listed footnote, which wasn't at the library, so I ordered the book, it arrived, I opened it, I read it, and the Hearn Wormius thing checks out. Amazing. But even after that, Alexander Pope just couldn't let it go for some reason, and after Hearn's death he wrote, Alex, jeez! So, as you can see, we've traveled down many paths here, and at this point I really needed a friend to talk to about this in my life. The number of people willing to listen for months on end to updates about not even the very broad topic of the origin of the name Tiffany, remember, that's where we started, not even of the exact original source of one poem that mentions the name Tiffany A and Y, but of two dead dude schoolboy level squabbles that are tangentially related to Tiffany is zero. But then there was hope. I can't even remember how I found it now, but I came across another Hearn burn via historian John Horace Round, in his feudal England, historical studies on the X-Ith and X-Ith-Ith centuries, complaining about Hearn's lack of document date questioning, ignoring of internal evidence, and superficial examinations, leading to publishing more wrong dates polluting the timeline for everyone. Oh, and Hearn also got the poem's surname spelling wrong, twice, which is why nothing turned up for Connorsby family records earlier. Oof. At this point, Hearn having cost me so much time and feeling so thoroughly alone in the world, I was excited to find in John Horace Round a friend to phone and complain with over coffee. As it happens, he even translated part of the Doomsday book, which was the very first source I checked when starting the Tiffany project so long ago. We were going to have loads to talk about. While searching for his digits, I realized in my excitement I had missed the original publication date of his work. Round had died a hundred years ago, and I was back to being Grey Nomades, as usual. Okay, so look, this side path I've been carving out to even be able to talk about the Brittany Tiffany poem is only a tiny, tiny part of all of the explorations that had to happen to make the main Tiffany video. I've been here alone for, oh god, half a year as the only one alive who cares about any of this. This script is so long now. Will anyone make it this far? Is anyone here? Okay, snap out of it. Now, in my journeys, I had learned two things about Hearn. First, his contemporaries referred to him as an antiquarian, which in my head translated as old-timey for historian, but was actually old-timey code for hoarder. Hearn loved collecting every historic document he could find, but was not very good at sorting them out. The second thing was that Hearn's edition of the Scott Ronamma Con, from which all sources pointed back to as the providence of the poem, is worse than useless, as not only are his contributions of dubious value, but he also took it upon himself to cut out a lot, which explains why his edition was printed in giant font. This is not considered canonical. And this should have been the end of it, but there was still something left to try to pin to the timeline. Was this Tiffany A.N.Y. a real person, and when did she live? Okay, I know. In retrospect, it seems obvious. I should have started here painfully obvious, but you only know at the end what is the fastest way from the beginning. Now, surely, I thought, at least tracking down genealogical records of the family the poem mentioned, everything would check out. Right? Wrong. So, as a reminder, the poem starts with William from Brittany, wife Tiffany. William Connesby was a real person in the 1300s in England, not Brittany, and his wife was Beatrice, not Tiffany. They had a son, Thomas Connesby, who did go to Brittany with the Black Prince, who was alive at the time, to battle, and Thomas, while fighting, became a prisoner of war. However, his captor agreed to let Thomas go if he would marry his daughter Tiffany, which he did, and it was Thomas who came out of Brittany with his wife Tiffany, except not, because if you look up her paperwork, her name is actually Theophania! She was only called Tiffany hundreds of years later, so the poem isn't right about anything! God damn you, Hearn! Everything is wrong, and the poem is evidence of nothing useful at all! I'm sorry. It's just, it's been a lot. So here's the final working theory. Hearn knew the Connesby family, who either told him of the poem or perhaps he spotted it himself, expressed an outsized interest in their collection of old papers, as he was wont to do, but either way, when editing his edition of the Scottacronicon, and it mentioned the family, that triggered his memory and he added in his footnote, wrong as he saw it or wrong as he remembered it. That note in his non-canonical edition, through pure bad luck, got swept up in the paper writing footnote copy-paste game where no one checks the original, and the context that the name Tiffany is not actually in the original book got lost. At least now the timeline is complete, but all this work has shown is that in the 1700s, the name Tiffany A&Y existed, which was not in question at all at the beginning. For the god's capricious tormenting pleasure alone, this path went absolutely nowhere, provided nothing of value, and drained many hours of my sadly finite life. Uh, thanks for listening? I guess I just really needed to get out all of this frustration to tell you the story of tracking down a poem that didn't even make it into the main video. The end. Hello. Thank you for making it to not just the end of the video, but after the end of the video. Welcome. Well, that ended up being quite a journey over the past half a year. Sometimes in making a video, the path through the forest of all knowledge is clearly marked out. Other times, you have something much more difficult to try to get through. Don't step on the... whoa. And occasionally, there's almost nothing, and you're in danger of getting quite lost. But this is the job, to turn something that is unmarked into something that's slightly marked, perhaps something that's been completed with trusses to get you over the dangerous and difficult parts. Some of the videos I make take unreasonably long amounts of time and unreasonably large amounts of effort. Uh, things that are frankly not very good business sense from a YouTube algorithm sort of way, but I know that as a viewer, I love it when people make those sorts of videos, and I imagine if you're still watching, you're one of the people who likes those kinds of videos as well. I've resisted for years coming up with a name for the people who support the channel. I've never really liked that stuff, but I've changed my thoughts on that because I realize that they really are part of the team now. And I know how this is going to sound, but I really mean it. The past six months, I have definitely felt very alone at times working on this, but one of the things that has helped me push on with a crazy project like this is knowing that there are a lot of people who really care about these videos. The capricious whims of the YouTube gods cannot be relied upon, but people willing to back projects directly that they really like, it means so much. These videos aren't for everyone. They're for you. So if you would like to become a Bonny B and help support the creation of future videos, which will also get you access to some of the behind-the-scenes of how the videos are made, I just have one requirement first. You must be financially self-supporting, so no students in particular. I want people to work on themselves and work on their own lives before they try to help me out. I will be fine. Make sure you're good first. And I plan on doing this for a long time. I have been doing this for a long time. I'll be here later. So as long as you're set there, if you would like to join, you can click here. And thank you so much. I'll see you in the next video.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 3701\n","\n","Link  277 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/KIbkoop4AYE\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/KIbkoop4AYE\n","[youtube] KIbkoop4AYE: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] KIbkoop4AYE: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 3.58MiB in 00:44\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  The debt limit is a kind of financial weapon of mass destruction chained to the United States government by the United States government. Confused? Then it's time for the United States Debt Limit Explained. To understand the debt limit, you need to know the US splits financial responsibility between the President and Congress. The President has two jobs when it comes to money. One, collect taxes, and two, spend those taxes to run the government. This might give you the impression that the President, with regards to money, is all-powerful, especially when you hear news reports on the President's new budget or his plan to raise taxes on haberdasher's or lower taxes on apiarists. But reality is just the opposite, and the President is the one who takes orders. From whom? Congress. Congress has the jobs of setting the tax level and determining how much the government will spend by writing a budget. So while the President does get to submit budgets to Congress and asks for changes in the tax level, these are just requests that Congress doesn't have to pay attention to. Congress can add or subtract anything they want from the President's budget or throw it out entirely and write a new one. The same goes for the level of taxes. So Congress decides what it wants, bridges, tanks, buildings, courts, robots on Mars, robots on Earth, national parks, whatever, and approves a budget with that stuff in it. Once approved, the President is required by law to spend the money Congress listed in the budget and pay for it using the taxes that Congress set. As long as more taxes come in than spending goes out, everything is fine, but almost always Congress puts more stuff in the budget than they cover with taxes, which means that the President must borrow money to cover the difference. In most countries, the story ends here, because if their legislatures approve more spending than they have income, they've also implicitly approved the necessary borrowing, but not in America. Here, Congress also limits the total amount of debt the United States can have. A debt limit sounds like a good idea until you see the real-world consequences of these two branches of government interacting. As the total amount borrowed gets closer to the limit, Congress usually points to the President and acts shocked, shocked that his reckless spending has brought us so close to the debt limit that they, reasonable, prudent Congress, have set. And while it's technically correct that the President has borrowed this money, Congress has forced him to do it by approving a budget that the President is legally obligated to spend without also approving the necessary taxes to cover that spending. So the debt limit fight is essentially the government version of the playground favorite, Stop Hitting Yourself, except with added terror for everyone watching, for it's important to note that debt limit is not about future spending. It's not a credit card on which the limit will be raised so a crazy government party can be thrown. The debt limit is about paying bills already incurred. For example, the government hires a company to repave a federal highway. But if the US is at the debt limit when the company asks to be paid after the work has been done, the government can't. This shakes trust in the US and since large parts of the global economy depend on the dollar being trustworthy, messing with that trust is a big deal. But there is a way out. Congress can raise the debt limit and, because of the aforementioned terror, they always have. So if not raising the debt ceiling is potentially disastrous and the solution is simple and always taken in the end, why does this debate last months? Because politics. The debt limit isn't in the constitution, Congress created it themselves, and from their point of view, the debt limit is awesome because 1. It creates a problem that 2. Congress can technically blame on the president who 3. Needs the solution that only they can provide. Congress gets to use the threat of mutual financial self-destruction as leverage in negotiations that they benefit from extending until the last possible second.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 707\n","\n","Link  278 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/thOifuHs6eY\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/thOifuHs6eY\n","[youtube] thOifuHs6eY: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] thOifuHs6eY: Downloading webpage\n"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["ERROR: unable to download video data: HTTP Error 403: Forbidden\n"]},{"metadata":{"tags":null},"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Skipped 278\n","\n","\n","Link  279 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/rStL7niR7gs\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/rStL7niR7gs\n","[youtube] rStL7niR7gs: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] rStL7niR7gs: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 19.95MiB in 06:03\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Do you want to rule? Do you see the problems in your country and know how to fix them? If only you had the power to do so. Well, you've come to the right place. But before we begin this lesson in political power, ask yourself why don't rulers see as clearly as you, instead acting in such selfish, self-destructive, short-sighted ways? Are they stupid, these most powerful people in the world, or is it something else? The throne looks omnipotent from afar, but it is not as it seems. Take the throne to act, and the throne acts upon you. Accept that or turn back now before we discuss the rules for rulers. No matter how bright the rays of any Sun King, no man rules alone. A king can't build roads alone, can't enforce laws alone, can't defend the nation or himself alone. The power of a king is not to act, but to get others to act on his behalf, using the treasure in his vaults. A king needs an army and someone to run it, treasure and someone to collect it, law and someone to enforce it. The individuals needed to make the necessary things happen are the king's keys to power. All the changes you wish to make are but thoughts in your head if the keys will not follow your commands. In a dictatorship where might makes right, the number of keys to power is small, perhaps only a dozen generals, bureaucrats, and regional leaders. Sway them to your side and the power to rule is yours, but never forget, displease them and they will replace you. Now all countries lie on a spectrum from those where the ruler needs few key supporters to those where the ruler needs many. This foundation of power is why countries are different. Yet many keys or few, the rules are the same. First, get the key supporters on your side. With them you have the power to act, you have everything. Without them you have nothing. Now in order to keep those keys to power, you must second, control the treasure. You must make sure your treasure is raised and distributed to you for all your hard work and to the keys needed to keep your position. This is your true work as a ruler, figuring out how best to raise and distribute resources so as not to topple the house of cards upon which your throne sits. Now you aspiring benevolent dictator may want to help your citizens, but your control of the treasure is what attracts rivals. So you must keep those keys loyal, but there's only so much treasure in your vault, so much wealth your kingdom produces. So be aware, every bit of treasure spent on citizens is treasure not spent on loyalty. Thus doing the right thing, spending the wealth of the nation on the citizens of the nation, hands a tool of power acquisition to your rivals. Treasure poured into roads and universities and hospitals is treasure a rival can promise to key supporters if only they switch sides. Benevolent dictators can spend their take on the citizens, but the keys must get their rewards, for even if you have gathered the most loyal angelic supporters, they have the same problem as you, just one level down. Being a key to power is a position of power. They too must watch out for rivals from below or above, thus the treasure they get must also be spent to maintain their position. The loyal and dim may stay by your side no matter what, but smart key supporters will always watch the balance of power ready to change allegiance if you look to be the loser in a shifting web of alliances. In countries where the keys are few, the rewards are great, and when violence rules, the most ruthless are attracted, and angels that build good works will lose to devils that don't. So buy all the loyalty you can, because loyalty in dictatorial organizations of all kinds is everything, for the ruler anyway. Thus the dictatorship exposed, a king who needs his court to raise the treasure to keep the court loyal and keep raising the treasure. This is the self-sustaining core of power, all outside is secondary. Now a king with many key supporters has real problems, not just their expense, but also their competing needs and rivalries are difficult to balance. The more complicated the social and financial web between them all, the more able a rival is to sway a critical mass. The more key supporters a ruler has on average, the shorter their reign. Which brings us to the third rule for rulers, minimize key supporters. If a key in your court becomes unnecessary, his skills no longer required, you must kick him out. After a successful coup, the new dictator will purge some of those who helped him come to power, while working with the underlings of the previous dictator. Which from the outside seems a terrible idea. Why abandon your fellow revolutionaries? Are the old dictators supporters not a danger? But the keys necessary to gain power are not the same as those needed to keep it. Having someone on the payroll who was vital in the past, but useless now, is the same as spending money on the citizens. Treasure wasted on the irrelevant. And by definition, a dictator that pulls off a coup has promised greater treasure to those switching sides. The size of the vault has not changed, so the treasure must be split among fewer. A dictator that sways the right keys, takes control of the treasure, cuts unnecessary spending, kills unnecessary keys, will have a long and successful career. Seeing the structure unveiled, you might be excited to get started and control a country to the benefit of you and your cronies. Or you might be exhausted, wishing to do good, but seeing the structural difficulties now turn to democracy for salvation. So let us discuss rulers as representatives. You again might have grand dreams of the utopia you wish to build, but no man rules alone, and never more so than in democracy. Presidents and prime ministers must negotiate with their senates and parliaments and vice versa, and they all have their own key supporters to manage. In a well-designed democracy, power is fractured among many and is taken not with force, but with words. Meaning you must get thousands or millions of citizens to, if not like you on election day, at least like you better than the alternative. With so many voters and such fractured power, it's impossible to, as a dictator would, follow these rules and buy loyalty. Or is it? Of course not. Don't think of citizens as individuals with their individual desires, but instead as divided into blocks. The elderly or homeowners or business owners or the poor. Blocks you can reward as a group. Democracies have wildly complicated tax codes and laws, not as accident but as reward for the blocks that get and keep the ruling representatives in power. Farming subsidies, for example, have nothing to do with the food a nation needs, but entirely with how key the vote of the farming bloc is. Countries where farmers votes don't swing elections don't have farming subsidies. If a bloc doesn't vote, such as younger citizens, then no need to divert rewards their way. Even if large in number, they are irrelevant to gaining power. Which is good news for you. One less block to sway and the treasure you give your key blocks has to come from somewhere. If you want long years in office, rule 3 is your friend in a democracy just as much as a dictatorship. You can't eliminate those who don't vote for you, but there is still much you can do. Once in power, make it easier for your key blocks to vote and harder for others. Establish voting systems that reduce the number of blocks you need to win the more rivals you get. Very handy indeed. Draw election borders to predetermine the results for you or your cronies and have party pre-elections with Byzantine rules to determine who blocks even can vote for. Mix and match the above for even better power perpetuation. When approval ratings couldn't be lower, yet re-election rates couldn't be higher, you'll know you've succeeded. Now enough with thinking about the citizens. Even in a democracy, there still are very influential individual key supporters you need on your side because their money or influence or favors keeps you in power. While you can't just promise to give them treasure directly as a dictator would, you can create loopholes for their investments, pass laws that they've written, or print get out of jail free cards for their actions. Not a wheelbarrow of gold to the door, but contracts for their business. You as a ruler do have roads to build or computers to maintain or buildings to reconstruct. No man rules alone after all. Or you could take the moral path and ignore the big keys, but you'll fight against those who didn't. Good luck with that. Corruption is not some kind of petty crime, but rather a tool of power in democracies and dictatorships. But more on that another time. So accept the favors, sway the key blocks, and you will get into power, ruling with actions that look contradictory and stupid to those who don't understand the game. Privately helping a powerful industry you publicly denounced or passing laws that hurt a block that voted for you. But your job isn't to have a consistent understandable ruling policy, but to balance the interests of your keys to power big and small. That is how you stay in office. Now with all this headache of being a representative, you may wonder looking at rule 3, why couldn't you skip all this block building favor trading nonsense and just bribe the army to take power? We must finally turn to taxes and revolts. You must understand rule 2 and how the treasure is raised and used to hold the country together. If we graph the tax rate of countries versus the number of key supporters the ruler needs, there's a clear relationship. More democracy, lower taxes. If you're sitting comfortably in a cushy democracy, you may scoff at this, but you are fellow citizens who don't earn enough, don't pay income taxes, and get rebates, bringing the average tax rate down. In dictatorships, this doesn't happen. Dictatorships often forego tax paperwork in favor of just taking wealth directly. It's common for the dictator to force farmers to sell their produce to him for little, then turn around and sell it on the open market, pocketing the difference at an unthinkably high equivalent tax rate. So taxes in democracies are low in comparison to dictatorships. But why do representatives lower their take? Well, cutting taxes is a crowd-bleaser. Dictators have no need to please the crowds and thus can take a large percentage from their poor citizens to pay key supporters. But representatives in a democracy can take a smaller percentage from each to pay their key supporters because their educated, freer citizens are more productive than peasants. For rulers in a democracy, the more productivity, the better, which is why they build universities and hospitals and roads and grant freedoms. Not just out of the goodness of their hearts, but because it increases citizen productiveness, which increases treasure for the ruler and their key supporters, even when a lower percentage is taken. Democracies are better places to live than dictatorships, not because representatives are better people, but because their needs happen to be aligned with a large portion of the population. The things that make citizens more productive also make their lives better. Representatives want everyone productive, so everyone gets highways. The worst dictators are those whose incentives are aligned with the fewest citizens, those who have the fewest keys to power. This explains why the worst dictatorships have something in common. Gold or oil or diamonds or similar. If the wealth of a nation is mostly dug out of the ground, it's a terrible place to live because a gold mine can run with dying slaves and still produce great treasure. Oil is harder, but luckily foreign companies can extract and refine it without any citizen involvement. With citizens outside this cycle, they can be ignored while the ruler is rewarded and the keys to power kept loyal. Thus we live in a world where the best, smartest democracies are stable, the worst, richest dictatorships are stable, and in between is a valley of revolution. The resource-rich dictators build roads only from their ports to their resources and from their palace to the airport, and the people stay quiet not because this is fine or even because they're scared, but because the cold truth is starving, disconnected, illiterates don't make good revolutionaries. Now a middling dictator without resources must, as mentioned before, take a large amount of wealth directly from his poor farmers and factory workers. Thus two roads won't do, and so he must maintain some minimums of life for the citizens. But keeping the workforce somewhat connected and somewhat educated and somewhat healthy makes them more able to revolt. Now understand, the romantic image of the people storming the gates and overthrowing their dictator is mostly a fantasy. If you run a middling dictatorship, the people only storm the palace when the army lets them to remove you because you lost control over your keys and are being replaced. This is why after popular revolts in middling dictatorships, the new ruler is often the same as the old, if not worse. The people didn't replace the king, the court replaced the king, using the people's protest they let happen to do it. The very things a benevolent dictator wants to build to cross this valley take treasure away from the keys to power and make the citizens more able to revolt, often ending in a stronger ruler less likely to build bridges and more loyal to his keys. On the other side, the best democracies are stable not just because the large number of keys and their competing desires makes dictatorial revolt near impossible to organize, but also because the revolt would destroy the very wealth it intended to capture, the high productivity of the citizens. Plus those helping the would-be dictator in a democracy know he plans to cull key supporters once in power. That's what a coup is. So potential key supporters must weigh the probability of surviving the cull and getting the rewards versus the risk of being on the outside of a dictatorship they helped create. In a stable democracy, that's a terrible gamble. Maybe you'll be incredibly wealthy but probably you'll be dead and have made the lives of everyone you know worse. The math says no. Being on the right side of a coup in a dictatorship means having the resources to get you and your family what the peasants lack. Health care, education, quality of life. This is what makes the competition for power so fierce. But in a democracy, most already have these things, so why risk it? So the more the wealth of a nation comes from the productive citizens of the nation, the more the power gets spread out and the more the ruler must maintain the quality of life for those citizens. The less, the less. Now if a stable democracy becomes very poor or if a resource that dwarfs the productivity of the citizens is found, the odds of this gamble change and make it more possible for a small group to seize power. Because if the current quality of life is terrible or the wealth not dependent on the citizens, coups are worth the risk. When democracies fall, these are usually the reasons. These rules for rulers explain not only why some men are monsters and others are merciful, but everything about politics, from war to foreign aid to political dynasties to corruption. All of which we can talk about at another time. But for now, you aspiring ruler may be disgusted by the world of politics and have decided to avoid it entirely. But you cannot, for rulers come in many forms. Yes, kings, presidents, and prime ministers, but also deans, dons, mayors, chairs, chiefs. These rules apply to all and explain their actions. From the CEO of the largest global corporate conglomerate who must keep his board happy to the chair of the smallest homeowners association managing votes and spending membership fees. You cannot escape structures of power. You can only turn a blind eye to understanding them. And if you ever want the change you dream about, there's a zeroth rule you cannot ignore. Without power, you can affect nothing. You may not like these rules, but surely better you on the throne than someone else. And who knows, maybe you'll be different.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 2851\n","\n","Link  280 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/8Fn_30AD7Pk\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/8Fn_30AD7Pk\n","[youtube] 8Fn_30AD7Pk: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 8Fn_30AD7Pk: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 8.97MiB in 01:48\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  The Interstate Highway Shields hide within them long-forgotten knowledge. As our great ancestors could navigate by the signs in the sky before the creation of the compass, so too before GPS could they navigate by these signs. Come with me and learn how to navigate the constellations created across a continent by the Interstate Highway System. First are the Interstate Majors, beginning with I-90 from Seattle to Boston, the longest and northernest of all the highs. Then the southernest, Jacksonville, Florida, to Santa Monica, California, I-10. Interstate Majors that run east-west are double digits ending in zero. The bigger, the northerner. So, filling in the rest. The next northernest is San Francisco, California, to Teaneck, New Jersey, I-80, and the next southernest, Florence, South Carolina, to Kent, Texas, I-20. Then, Coe, Fort Utah, to Baltimore, Maryland, I-70, and Little Rock, Arkansas, to Fort Worth, Texas, I-30. Okay, so that one is the most minor of the majors, and it doesn't quite fit as well with the rest, with its diagonality. But I'm confident it's the lone exception and not foreshadowing. Next, Barstow, California, to Wilmington, North Carolina, I-40, then I-50 and I-60, which don't exist. See, there are older highways than the Interstate System. Slower, other ways not built to the Interstate's Book of Exalted Construction Codes. These are called U.S. Highways or U.S. Roots, the most famous of which is Route 66, and these use the United States Numbered Highway System, which put the old U.S. Route 50 and 60 right in the middle. The Department of Transportation knew that only the most devout roadway anoraks would be attuned to the difference between Interstates and routes, and normals would simply look at the number. To simplify everyone's life, DOT skipped Interstates 50 and 60 to avoid mines getting muddled in the middle of America. That's the East-West Interstate majors' coverage. Now, on to North-South, the longest of which is Maine to Miami, Florida, I-95, which, like all majors, no exception, surely, are double digits, but ending in 5 now to indicate verticality. On the opposite coast, San Diego, California, to Blaine, Washington, is I-5. Okay, so already that's not double digits, but maybe officially it has a leading zero, but just not on the sign, right, Department of Transportation? No? Okay, well, then, I-5 has a leading zero in our hearts. The rest of the North-South Interstate majors are Petersburg, Virginia, to Montgomery, Alabama, I-85, a bit of a sister route to I-30, San Diego, California, to Sweetgrass, Montana, I-15, to St. Marie, Michigan, to Hialeah, Florida, I-75, Las Cruces, New Mexico, to Buffalo, Wyoming, I-25, then I-45, from Houston, Texas, to Dallas, Texas. Contrary to popular belief, interstates don't have to be interstate interstates. They can be intrastate interstates. The obvious examples are Hawaii and Alaska, which have intrastate interstates, but also Puerto Rico, which has an extrastate intrastate? I mean, I guess technically it's an extra-inter-unincorporated territory? Anyway, these three, being physically disconnected from the rest of the network, use a different numbering system with letters. But back on the continent, there are, in fact, way more intrastate interstates than interstate interstates. Most are the intrastate minors we will get to, but I-45 is notable for being the only intrastate major that's intrastate. Finishing up the North-South majors, it's Texas again, in Laredo, to Duluth, Minnesota, I-35, then Chicago, Illinois, to Laplace, Louisiana, I-55, and finally hop over to Mobile, Alabama, up to Gary, Indiana, on I-65. Together, the interstate major constellation with its shining numbers lets you navigate the nation. The lower the numbers, the more south and west you are, the higher north and east. If it ends in zero, you're traveling horizontally, and if it ends in five, vertically. Very satisfying. Now, there are scores of lesser-connecting constellations as well. These are interstate minors and use three digits to communicate their navigational secrets. Interstate minors diverge from a major and have their last two digits match the major from whence they came. Then, if the first digit is even, it means the interstate minor will eventually connect back to its parent major. For example, as I-70 crosses the nation, I-670 diverts in Kansas City, Missouri, but eventually circles back to connect to I-70 in Kansas City, Kansas. Even-numbered minors are often called bypasses when they bypass something or beltways when they encircle something. An interstate minor that starts with an odd number warns that it will not connect back to its parent. This is called a spur. Example, as I-90 goes past Buffalo, I-190 diverges, and the odd digit lets you know you won't be coming back, instead plunging one way into the wilds of Canada. Nice! Though sometimes a spur won't just go nowhere, it will instead connect back to another interstate major. In this case, which of the double digits are used as the base of the triple? And the answer is... There isn't a consistent answer. It's up to the states. So that's interstate majors and minors, but there's also interstate mediums, like I-64 from Wentzville, Missouri, to Chesapeake, Virginia, and I-29 from Kansas City, Missouri, to Pembroke, North Dakota. The interstate mediums follow the same numbering pattern as the majors. All two digits, if we keep those leading zeros in our hearts, evens east-west, odds north-south. All in order, too, except for I-99, which is so annoying. DOT, why did you do this? What? Congress specifically picked 99 out of order for this highway, so Congress is the only one who can fix it? Ugh! Well, let's just try to ignore that and move on. The interstate majors are all uniquely numbered, but not so with the mediums. There's an I-76 from Big Springs, Nebraska, to Denver, Colorado, and another I-76 from Belmar, New Jersey, to Akron, Ohio. Sandwiched between the majors I-90 and I-80 are duplicate medium I-84s, I-86s, I-87s, and I-88s. The rule is that, as long as the duplicates are far enough away to avoid muddling minds, it's fine. There are also loads of duplicate interstate minors, which there have to be if you think about it. Take I-95, which crosses 15 densely populated states. To only have nine options for spurs and bypasses would be rather limiting. In fact, just Maryland alone has an I-195, I-295, I-395, I-495, I-595, I-695, I-795, I-895, and— Really? Ugh! So close! DOT, you've got to build an I-995 in Maryland just to complete the set for me, please! So, that's the system, but as we've already seen with interstate mediums, anything built over decades is going to acquire exceptions. And taking a little detour to my home interstate, I-495, aka the Long Island Expressway, aka the LIE— Don't dare call it the lie or locals will laugh at you— This is the spinal spur of the Long Island fish, never connecting back to its parent I-95 because Long Island is an island. But as a one-way spur, it should start with an odd digit, not an even, and it really should be a two-digit interstate medium, because it technically doesn't connect to I-95 at all. Rather just dropping you off in midtown Manhattan with an, LOL buddy, good luck finding the Lincoln Tunnel. I guess the LIE is a lie, after all. A worse exception on the other coast in San Francisco is Interstate 238, which the number tells you should be a bypass off of I-38, but no, I-38 doesn't exist. I-238 is a one-way spur connecting two other interstate miners, I-580 and I-880, so I don't even know what's going on here. There's also some weirdly one-off numbering, such as I-35, which splits into I-35 East and I-35 West to reach Fort Worth and Dallas before rejoining and pulls the same trick up north, dividing in tween east-west branches again to hit the twin cities. Why wasn't just one of the branches on each end picked to be the bypass so that the system could be consistent? Was it because the cities didn't want to be the one considered bypassed? Ugh, that's totally the reason, isn't it? The weirdest one-off is the nice I-69, which splits itself into I-69 East, I-69 West, and I-69 Sea. Okay, you do you, I-69. At least you have a sign, unlike back in New York with America's smallest interstate, I-878, at just under a mile, which apparently doesn't deserve a sign, so the interstate anoraks can never complete their selfie collection. Okay, that's enough exceptions. I could do this all day, I already cut so many from the script you wouldn't believe it, back to the big, beautiful, constructed constellation and its lost wayfinding ways, now revealed so that, as your ancestors before you navigated by the sky, you too can go on an American road trip navigating by the interstate numbers alone. Well, after you memorize all the exceptions. I mean, practically, you should still just use your GPS. It's very reliable, and it also lets you know the traffic.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1499\n","\n","Link  281 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/wfYbgdo8e-8\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/wfYbgdo8e-8\n","[youtube] wfYbgdo8e-8: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] wfYbgdo8e-8: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 4.59MiB in 01:31\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Your brain is two brains, two hemispheres, each doing half the work of being you. Half your vision goes to each and half your movement directed by each. Right controls left and left controls right. Your two brains coordinate through a wire of nerves, but this wire can be cut and was, for a time, used as an epilepsy treatment. After the cut, people seemed the same, though their brain was split in twain. Except some post-split patients describe that while selecting their morning outfit with right hand, left might come along to disagree. Actually, left hand might quite often disagree, which these split brain patients found frustrating. What's happening? To investigate, remember, right brain sees and controls one half while left brain controls and sees the other. But only left brain can speak, hello, because that's where the speech center is located. Right brain, without this, is mute. In normal brains, this doesn't matter because each half communicates across the wire with the other. Left brains can't, and thus you can show just the right brain a word, ask the person what did you see, and you'll hear nothing. Because left speaking brain saw nothing. Meanwhile, right brain will use its hand to pick the object out of a pile hidden from left brain. This is deeply creepy. Ask why are you holding the object and speaking, left brain will make up a plausible sounding, but totally wrong reason. I always wanted to learn how to solve one of these. Left brain isn't lying, it's just doing what brains do, creating a story that explains its past actions to its current self. A behavior which does rather cast doubt onto the notion of free will, but that's a story for another time. Creating reasons for why it does things is just something left brains do, it happens in normal, healthy humans all the time, and if you think about it closely, you know you've done this. Back to experiments. Give right brain an object, ask the person what's in your hand, and they won't be able to say. I'm not holding anything. And when asked to draw, a split brain can draw two separate objects simultaneously with each hand in a way unsplit brains find challenging. These experiments on split brain patients are deeply unsettling because they really point in the direction of a mute, separate, intelligence... something living in the skull. You can even ask questions of a split brain and get disagreement on the answer. So if your brain is split, who is the you in this situation? On the outside, it's tempting to think of the part of the brain that's speaking as the person, but something is hearing and answering questions. And though right brain can't speak, it does understand faces, which left brain can't. If this is you, you don't know who your friends and family are in a crowd. This act of cutting exposes two minds in one head, and the talking mind doesn't know there's someone else in the house. The left brain can describe the situation it's in, but nonetheless will constantly be surprised by right brain's actions and explain them away. There's a question to be asked here. Why after separation does right brain not totally freak out, but instead plays along helpfully answering questions and listening to left brain's dumb stories about what's happening? It's the best pony? I don't know. Speculation time. One answer is the cutting doesn't make right brain a separate intelligence, consciousness, person, but rather it has always been. In normal people, perhaps right brain grows up as a companion without a choice, feeling at first somewhat equal partners, but then as speech develops that it can't participate in, that increasingly becomes the central point of life, it resigns to mutely coordinate with left brain. At this moment in your normal head, there are two of you watching this video. One having a mind equals blown moment and the other mentally rolling its eye at the obviousness of it all. In split brains, right doesn't freak out because not a whole lot has really changed. You might not agree and may be arguing right now why it can't be possible, exactly as we would expect talking left brain to do. Speculation aside, split brain patients show at the very least that in the mind there is a separate something that can hear and understand and respond given the right circumstances. Your brain isn't entirely yours. Who is you? You is too. But we can go deeper. You are many. The pile of meat that is your body is made up of trillions of tiny individuals that have a life of their own. So at which point do the many become one? What makes lots of tiny things you?

The world's largest buyer of coffee, the US, has to import nearly all of this, as the coffee trees from which caffeine is harvested will only grow at commercial levels between the Tropic of Cancer and the Tropic of Capricorn in an area called the Coffee Belt. Only a single state, Hawaii, is within this belt. However, the United States is only the largest buyer because it's so populous. The most enthusiastic coffee drinkers per capita are, in increasing order, the Netherlands, Denmark, Iceland, Norway, and, the world champions, Finland, where they drink three times as much coffee a day as the average American. All of these countries are outside the Coffee Belt and must import 100% of their caffeine supply. To get this caffeine, first bees must pollinate the flowers of a coffee tree, and these flowers develop into bright red berries. Unlike more cooperative domestic plants, the coffee tree does not ripen all its berries at the same time, so they need to be hand-picked and sorted. Once picked, the coffee bean is removed from inside the berry. This young seedling of the tree is then dried, heated, ground, and submersed in boiling water to get out the precious, precious caffeine. It takes about 40 coffee beans to make one shot of espresso. But why is caffeine in the coffee beans in the first place? It's not like the coffee trees want to have humans cutting bits off of them and committing a holocaust of their offspring. Well, the trees, of course, don't want or feel anything. They originally evolved caffeine for their own benefit. Caffeine is an insecticide that effectively paralyzes or kills bugs chomping on the tree. Whether or not these insects go out, experiencing the greatest caffeine high ever is not known. While caffeine is technically lethal, it's adapted for 1 gram bugs, not monkeys 100,000 times more massive, so you'd really have to try to win this Darwin Award. But if you must, to calculate the dose of caffeine, you'll need to ingest to have a 50% chance of death, take your mass in kilograms, and multiply it by 150 milligrams. Or in terms of coffee, for every kilogram of mass you have, you need to drink one latte to get a visit from the Grim Reaper. That's a lot of coffee, so it's not surprising that there are no recorded deaths in healthy adults from this method, and it's doubtful that it's even possible. Because while you're busy getting coffee in, your body is busy getting it out by one way or another. The rare recorded deaths from caffeine are from diet pills, pep pills, and crazy people who eat the drug in its pure form. Poison though caffeine is, you do still develop an addiction to the stuff, and it's a real physiological addiction, not a wimpy psychological addiction like people claim for video games and the internet. But caffeine isn't heroin, rapid withdrawal won't kill you, it might make you cranky and give you a wicked headache, but since caffeine releases dopamine to make you happy and it gets rid of headaches, there's really no reason to ever stop using the stuff. And who would want to give it up anyway? I mean, aside from converts to Mormonism and Rastafarianism. Caffeine is the world's most used psychoactive drug, and with good reason, it's pure awesome. It increases concentration, decreases fatigue, and gives you better memory. And this isn't just a placebo, these are real effects replicable in a laboratory. And contrary to popular belief, drinking coffee isn't a Faustian bargain where the devil gives you the ability to work faster, but in exchange makes your life shorter. For normal, healthy humans, there are no medical concerns. Coffee and the caffeine within it may even have medical benefits, such as protection from cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and Parkinson's. Caffeine can even get rid of migraines, but the amount required and the method of ingestion is uncomfortable. Moving right along. You know what else you can thank caffeine for? A little thing called the Enlightenment. In the 1600s, people drank more beer and gin than water. But with the introduction of coffee and tea, people switched from a depressant to a stimulant. It's not surprising then that this time was an intellectual boon compared to earlier centuries. Ben Franklin and Edward Lloyd loved their coffee for the same reason that modern workers and students do. It's invaluable for staying awake and concentrating when you need to finish a TPS report or get through that boring physics class. Coffee is the fuel of the modern world, so go grab a cup guilt free and get working smarter and faster.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 805\n","\n","Link  283 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/kF8I_r9XT7A\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/kF8I_r9XT7A\n","[youtube] kF8I_r9XT7A: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] kF8I_r9XT7A: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 5.68MiB in 01:54\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Let's say you want to become Pope, head of the Catholic Church and shepherd to over 1 billion faithful. What requirements must you have for this lofty position? First, be a Catholic and second, be a man. Which seems a little thin and while it's technically possible for a regular Sunday Catholic to become Pope, the last time this happened was essentially never because becoming Pope isn't like becoming president. You can't just run for office. Selecting the Pope is an inside job and the men who do it are the Cardinals and while in theory they can select any Catholic man to become Pope, in practice they prefer to elevate one of their own. The last time a non-Cardinal became Pope was more than 600 years ago so while it isn't an official requirement, it's an unofficial official requirement. Thus, in order to become Pope, you'll first need to be a Cardinal and to do that you need to start climbing the Catholic corporate ladder. Step 1, become a priest. Unlike some churches where you can just fill out a form online and poof, ordained, the Catholic Church treats becoming a priest as a real, unique training profession so you're going to require a lot of education, usually a college degree in Catholic philosophy and then a master's in divinity. In addition to your educational qualifications, you must also be a man, unmarried, and willing to remain celibate. If you meet these requirements and have been working with the Church, then you can be officially ordained as a priest, which basically means you get to run a Catholic Church or work with another priest who does. But you want to move onward and to do that you need to take the job of the man who just made you a priest. Step 2, become a bishop. Bishops are a much more select group. While there are about 400,000 Catholic priests worldwide, there are only about 5,000 bishops. While priests get churches, bishops get cathedrals from which they oversee a number of local churches. To advance your career, you must wait for a bishop in your area to be forced into retirement at age 75 or die sooner than that, freeing up space for you. But you can't just apply because there's already a secret list of potential bishops that's updated every three years based on who the current bishops in your area think would make a good replacement for one of their own. To be on that list, in addition to the obvious requirement of being a pious person, you should also be at least 35 years old, have been a priest for at least five years, and have a doctorate in theology, or equivalent. Assuming you're all these things, your name may or may not be on the secret list. The local bishops then give that list to the pope's ambassador for your country, known as the Apostolic Nuncio. The Nuncio picks three priests from the list, does in-depth research on them, conducts interviews, and selects the one he thinks is best. But it's not over because the Nuncio sends his report to Vatican City and the Congress of Bishops who work there, reviewing potential appointments from around the world. If the Congress of Bishops doesn't like any of the three candidates, they can tell the Nuncio to start over, returning to the list, picking another three candidates, doing more research, more interviews, and sending off the results. When the Congress of Bishops is happy with one of the Nuncio's candidates, that name is given to the pope, who can reject the candidate and start the whole process over. It shouldn't be a surprise that from vacancy to a bishop's replacement can take months and, on occasion, years. But, assuming a bishop in your area retired or died at the right time, and you were on the secret list of good priests, and the Nuncio picked you, and you made it through his interview, and the Congress of Bishops approved you, and the pope didn't veto you, poof, now you're a bishop. But you're still not on top. The penultimate promotion is step number three, become a cardinal. Despite the fancy name and snazzy red outfits to match, cardinals are not the bosses of bishops. They are bishops, just with an additional title and additional responsibilities, the most notable of which is electing the new pope. The only way to become a cardinal is to get the current pope to appoint you as one. End of the 5,000 bishops, only about 200 are ever cardinals. But let's say your ambition doesn't go unnoticed by the pope, and he makes you a cardinal. Now it's time to play the waiting game for his death or retirement. And with popes, death is vastly more likely. When either happens, the cardinals under the age of 80 are brought to Vatican City, where they are isolated from the outside world, presumably by taking away their cell phones and tablets and carrier pigeons. Once sequestered, the election of a new pope can begin. These elections are never exactly the same, because the ex-pope leaves instructions on how he wants his replacements to be picked, but in general it works like this. Four times a day, the cardinals go to the Sistine Chapel to vote, and to become pope, one of them must get a two-thirds majority. There's a big dose of mustn't be too hasty here, as the cardinals don't just raise their hands or use a modern preferential voting system, but instead write down one name on a piece of paper, stand before the altar, and say a long Latin phrase before officially casting the ballot. Once all the cardinals have done this, the votes are counted and then burned. This is why TV news stations covering the election of pope use supermodern HD live-streaming cameras to look at a chimney. If the smoke is black, no new pope. The high victory threshold and tediously slow voting process is why it takes so long to elect a pope. It's usually at least two weeks of voting, four times a day, six days a week, with one day a week reserved for prayer, but the record length is three years. Assuming you, eventually, win the support of your fellow cardinals, you have one final thing to do before becoming pope. Pick yourself a new name. There's no formal rule, and you can name yourself anything you like, but it's tradition to take the name of a previous pope. Upon the acceptance of your new name, the final ballots are burned clean to make the smoke turn white and announce to the world that a new pope has been selected. So that's the career path. Be born into the right half of the population, become one of a billion Catholics, then one of 400,000 priests, then one of 5,000 bishops, then one of 200 cardinals, wait for the current pope to die or retire, and convince two-thirds of your fellow cardinals to select you as the one, the only pope.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1186\n","\n","Link  284 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/tlI022aUWQQ\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/tlI022aUWQQ\n","[youtube] tlI022aUWQQ: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] tlI022aUWQQ: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 4.61MiB in 01:02\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  What is Reddit? For much of the internet, Reddit is the gateway to everything interesting going on in the world. Checking reddit.com is like reading the daily newspaper, except that Reddit is timely, interactive, personalized, participatory, horrifyingly absorbing at times, and basically good. The way it works is that people submit links to Reddit, blog posts or images or videos, and other people vote those links up or down. It's a simple idea, but it makes Reddit into a list of the best stuff that people are reading or watching on the internet right now. The name is a contraction of Reddit, as in I already read it on Reddit, which, if you spend significant time on the site, is what you'll say to everyone who tries to show you anything. It's a kind of awesome curse. Because there are no editors on Reddit, you never know what you're going to find, but you can bet it's going to be funny or interesting or enraging, because thousands of other people have already voted that it's something to see. Think of it this way. If Google is where you go to search for things, then Reddit is where you go to see the things that people have found. But Reddit is not just one list of stuff, Reddit is a beautiful fractal with sections called subreddits. If you like just politics or programming or funny image captions or sports or world news, there are subreddits that list only that stuff. And there's going to be a subreddit for your city or country or region. Love a TV show that ended years ago? There's a subreddit where people are still talking about it as though it just aired. Tech geeks have their technology and flag geeks their vexillology, and on the off chance you're interested in something that doesn't yet exist, just press a button and a new subreddit is born. And each subreddit works just like the main page, a constantly updating list of interesting stuff according to the people interested in that stuff. And when a subreddit grows large, it can be terrifyingly good at this. For example, awe, a section devoted to adorableness, is a global 24-hour-a-day battle to find the cutest images ever. Turns out, if you give people with baby animal photos a place to have their baby animal photos compete, the result is the highest density of cuteness human civilization has yet created. But without editors running the site, how does that sorting process work? There's no time to get into the code, but you can think of it like this. Links people submit are balloons floating up and down the list. When someone votes up a link, it adds a bit of helium, and a down vote sucks out a little bit of helium. Periodically, Reddit puts weights on all of the balloons, giving newer links that show up later a chance to compete against the ones that have been around longer. This method is shockingly good at sorting stuff, be it international politics or pictures of computer setups. Of course, when a website covers the whole of human endeavor, things get weird, like subreddits for only photos of birds, with arms, or only photos of Hitler, with socks. And then there are always the other kinds of photos that humans like to look at, and sometimes collections of horrifying things that cannot be unseen. So yeah, this has taken a turn for the worse, but remember, Reddit can be weird not because Reddit is weird, but because humans are weird, and the great thing about Reddit is that it changes to suit you. As you join subreddits you like and leave those you don't, the main page becomes yours, listing all the best stuff from all the subreddits you follow and leaving out stuff from the ones you don't. So Reddit is a lot like life, it is what you make it. But links are only the tip of the Redditberg, because people can discuss the links, and this is where the true heart of Reddit lies. Most forums on the internet are hideous, but Reddit ain't your grandma's bulletin board. Just as that balloon sort method finds the best links, there's some math that's more complicated and less explainable that finds the most interesting comments in a discussion and brings them to the top. And Reddit displays comments in a way that encourages back and forth discussions, unlike some other comment systems. This sorting and threading means that the discussion of a link on Reddit is always more interesting than the link itself. So there are subreddits that are nothing but discussion, such as changemyview for debates, or ask a scientist where experts answer questions, or there's IMA where people say what they are, I am a fireman, or I am an escort, or I am a prison guard, and answer questions from the comments. And because people on Reddit are anonymous, discussions are way more interesting and open than if people were forced to use their real names. Though with anonymity, you'll find that not everyone's private thoughts exposed are beautiful, and sometimes it can be uncomfortable to see what the faceless group thinks about a topic. But luckily Reddit has a way to deal with comments you think are unhelpful, and despite people who act badly, it's clear that Reddit can only exist because the majority of people, even when anonymous, are good. But this anonymity isn't required, however, so you'll also find actors and authors, presidents and prime ministers all on Reddit answering questions from the community. And Reddit really is a community with its own culture and history that increasingly has an effect on the physical world, with things like meeting up in person and raising money for charity, and defending the internet, and helping a family be with their sick child, and holding the world's largest secret Santa, and sending teachers the supplies they need. With its rapid-fire democracy and shockingly quick reactions, Reddit can sometimes make you feel more like a citizen of the internet than a citizen of your own country. But in the end, it's hard to understand Reddit without just jumping in and commenting and voting, which you really should. Once you get the hang of the place, you'll wonder how you ever interneted without it.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1062\n","\n","Link  285 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/3uBcq1x7P34\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/3uBcq1x7P34\n","[youtube] 3uBcq1x7P34: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 3uBcq1x7P34: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 3.64MiB in 01:08\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  How many continents are there? If you grew up in the English-speaking world, you might think that the answer is obvious. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7. But not everyone counts continents the same way. The usual definition, that they're large land masses separated from others by oceans, is fine until you actually start to think about it and then you run into problems. Problems like this. Here's Europe, here's Asia, and you'll notice the lack of ocean between them. Then why are they two different continents? The usual reason for this split is a cultural one, that Europe is so different from Asia that it's best to pretend it's a separate entity. Okay, maybe. But if the cultural argument is valid, then surely it also applies to India and the Middle East. Now you have nine continents and a new problem. If culture defines continents, then you'll never stop drawing increasingly unhelpful lines. So some places ditch the cultural division and combine Europe and Asia into Eurasia. This Eurasia is not to be confused with this Eurasia, which has always been at war with East Asia. Making Eurasia gives a six-continent view of the world. But what about over here? North America and South America? They're connected to Panama, or at least they used to be, until Teddy Roosevelt decided that someone had to cut that country in half and it might as well be him. But even still, the canal is only 13 meters deep. You could walk all the way from northern Alaska across the narrow Panama Canal and, if it weren't for the deadly, impenetrable, poison-filled Brazilian rainforest, make it all the way to the southern tip of Chile. So North and South America, despite the canal, aren't really divided. Which is why some places, particularly South America, treat America as a single continent, not two. Which brings the total number of continents down to five. But if you disregard the Panama Canal, then you also have to disregard the Suez Canal, and you've just created the monstrously large Afro-Eurasian continent, 85 million square kilometers home to 5.7 billion people. With this four-continent view of the world, we must surely be done, because there are no more continents to merge and our definition from the beginning is now consistent. Except, we're not done, because of that troublesome word large. Exactly how large is continental large? Is Australia really a dinky continent, or is it King of the Islands? Why not make Greenland the smallest continent? It's pretty big, even if you took away its ice. And speaking of ice, what about Antarctica, the forgotten continent, unfairly smushed against the bottom of maps just because no one lives there? Remove the ice sheet that covers Antarctica, and you reveal it for the archipelago it really is, not the single landmass it pretends to be. And to complicate matters, the largest of these Antarctic islands is smaller than Australia. So if you want to keep calling Antarctica a continent, then there's a bunch of other islands that might want to be continents too. Islands like New Guinea, Borneo, Madagascar, Baffin Islands, Sumatra, and Honshu. While this seems inclusive to the point of silliness, ultimately someone has to decide what large means, and that's going to be an arbitrary line. This problem will be familiar to anyone who remembers the is Pluto a planet or not a planet fiasco, which hinged mostly on this same issue of size. So now we're more confused than before we started. There might be three continents, or dozens. You know what will sort this out? Science. Confusion plus science equals answers. Let's ask a geologist what a continent is. For them, a continent is a tectonic plate, part of the Earth's crust that moved together. So geologists, show us your continents. The Antarctic plate, the Australian plate, the Eurasian plate, the South American plate, the African plate. So far this is looking pretty good. The Middle Eastern plate, the Indian plate, the Caribbean plate, the Pacific plate. There isn't even anything there. Well there's mostly nothing there. The Nazca plate, the Scotia plate. Really? At least North America is still looking reasonable. Until you include a chunk of Russia, half of Japan, and half of Iceland. Well this is unhelpful. Thanks a lot geologists. The heart of the problem is that the word continent doesn't have a simple and consistent definition for everyday use. So how many continents are there? Well how many do you want there to be? Six. The answer is clearly six.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 763\n","\n","Link  286 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/ALaTm6VzTBw\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/ALaTm6VzTBw\n","[youtube] ALaTm6VzTBw: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] ALaTm6VzTBw: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 2.54MiB in 00:49\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  The way the work week works is the worst. Waking up on Monday, you've got five days in a row of work or school. It's too much for, but by Wednesday, withered is your soul with two more days, nay three more days, until the weekend. But, alas, the weekend is also broken. Two is the wrong number of days off because the first day off is just a collapse from the overly long work week, and the second day off is tainted by the looming Monday. The traditional weekend is, at best, 50% efficient. It takes three days off just to feel like two days off, and two days off feels like one day off. But here is where it gets interesting, because one day off isn't none day off. A day off never goes unappreciated. Which brings me to a new schedule for new living, weekend Wednesday. Take the last three work days, slide them over one slot, and bring the spare weekend day forward to Wednesday. Now, when you wake up on Monday, there's only two days to go until weekend Wednesday, then just three more days till Sunday. I've been working on this schedule, and boy, do I love it. Here are the advantages. Productivity goes down without breaks. That's true on the scale of a day, to the scale of a year, or a life, and it's certainly true on the scale of a week. Well-timed breaks equals a more effective you. A two-day push followed by a break, then a three-day push and rest feels amazing on both cycles. The days off are more relaxing, and the days on more concentrated. If you're self-employed with control over your schedule, or a student able to pick classes to keep days clear, I strongly suggest you give it a try. And if you're an employer, your employee is enthusiastically sharing this video with, it's worth considering if everyone is on board. Now, of course, weekend Wednesday won't work for the whole world, and that's fine. Better even, because that creates an off-cycle advantage for those of us who are on it. Having a free day when everyone else is working makes so many things easier, and faster, and crowdless. As for the Saturday, you now have time to wrap up the work week without interruptions from the rest of the world, leaving Sunday as a true day of rest. So that's the glory of weekend Wednesday. More frequent days off that feel 100%, more concentrated and shorter work sprints, with a bonus off-cycle advantage. If those sound intriguing, why not give it a try and see if weekend Wednesday works for you.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 446\n","\n","Link  287 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/_ArVh3Cj9rw\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/_ArVh3Cj9rw\n","[youtube] _ArVh3Cj9rw: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] _ArVh3Cj9rw: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 27.81MiB in 05:43\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. Where is your mind? Is it in your head? I mean, that's where your brain is, and your brain helps you remember and plan and make judgments and solve problems. But you also remember and plan with phones and notes and calendars. And you make judgments and solve problems with all sorts of things. You know, when you think about it, the brain is really just a wet lump of fat and protein, no firmer than a blob of tofu. But the mind is huge. It's an ever-expanding organ of tissue and wood and stone and steel and people, because of communication. Communication allows us to even make other people extensions of our minds. We can access their memories and perceptions and knowledge by simply asking. Or not. I don't need to learn how to fix a car and practice medicine and vulcanize rubber or remember everything. Other people are doing that for me, just as I do things for them. We are a species of individuals that is also one big interdependent lumbering growth. A frantic blur of flesh and concrete. A techno-sapien powered by imaginations and passions made real by a hallowed faculty we call reason. Reason, it is said, guides us to truer knowledge and better decisions. It's allowed us to increase life expectancy, suffer less, work together better, and it's bound to take us further and higher until the end of time. Or is it? The organ we use to reason takes millions of years to evolve, but the fruits of reason grow rapidly and are ever-accelerating. Over the next four decades, we are expected to build the equivalent of another New York City every month. And more concrete was installed in the last two decades outside the United States than the US installed during the entire 20th century. This growth means that quality of life around the world is rising. It means that electricity, manufactured goods, food, comfort, and transportation are all becoming more common and accessible. But there are hints that reason and logic are struggling against the complexity of it all, against our growing dependence on the things we've built and their unintended consequences. Nearly every part of life as we know it today involves or relies on a process that releases molecules with lopsided electrical charges. This property causes them to absorb and re-emit thermal radiation, pinging it around so that it escapes into space more slowly. Having more warmer parcels of air means stronger weather events. They can't be pinned to any particular extreme storm, but they make extreme storms in general more extreme and frequent. What's at stake isn't just bad weather, it's disaster. It's more lives lost, more property lost, it's more droughts, more hunger, more famine, more people needing refuge, and an even greater reliance on the very things that caused the problem in the first place. In total, we release about 51 billion tons of such gases every year, and we need to release zero. But how do you rethink everything? Who gets to direct the costs and tradeoffs? How do you achieve collaboration between nearly every local and national government when what works in one place won't work everywhere, when decisions affect jobs in one place and food in another, when not just things need to be rethought but also habits and traditions and values? How do you achieve consensus when a problem isn't obvious to the senses, is far away in space and time, requires solutions that affect people in different ways and, as a product of science, always carries some uncertainty? The philosopher Timothy Morton calls something so massively distributed in time and space and so viscous, so sticky that it adheres to all that touch it a hyperobject. Every civilization that grows at the speed of reason must at some point face hyperobjects. In fact, the fact that we still haven't found evidence of intelligent life beyond Earth has been brought up as evidence that some sort of great filter might exist that few civilizations manage to get past. That a hyperobject like our impact on the planet might be such a great filter is not a new idea. What it might take to solve it is the topic of Bill Gates's How to Avoid a Climate Disaster. And I decided to do this video in partnership with him and his team because the way we deal with hyperobjects reveals a lot about the mind. It's easy and common to think that we would all be better off if everyone was just more rational, right? But what if reasoning wasn't built for what we've become? Let's begin by looking at behavioral inertia. Behavioral inertia is the tendency to keep doing what you're already doing, status quo bias. It can be a frustrating bias if you desire change, but its origin isn't a flaw. If an organism has managed to survive long enough to reproduce and provide and care for its offspring, then the state of its world was sufficient for its genes to spread. That's all it takes to persist. The types of organisms we see around us will naturally be those that managed to persist and didn't after reaching that point rock the boat too much. So behavioral inertia can help slow down the accumulation of unintended consequences and the loss of ideas that work, but it can also slow down innovation and adaptation. If the environmental impacts of our society were more immediate and unignorable, it wouldn't be so tempting to apply this inertial break. But emissions are invisible, and their consequences aren't immediate or local. They impact future people and people far away, those who are different from us, poorer than us, people we will never meet. This may be one of the first challenges advancing civilizations face, wielding not just the power of technology and distributed cognition, but also the responsibilities. Extending the mind is really cool, but whether or not a species can extend their empathy might be a great filter. Surely, reasoning will allow us to do that, right? Well, what is reasoning? Well, reasoning is a way of making inferences. An inference is a piece of new information extracted from the information you already have. We make inferences all the time. Every living thing does. For example, we don't have measuring tape tentacles that shoot from our eyes, and what actually enters our brain is just a 2D image, but nonetheless, our brains can infer depth by attending to cues like stereopsis, occultation, perspective, parallax, size. Now, when this happens, we accept it as reality. We aren't aware of the visual processing that made it possible, and we don't have to be. If, however, we do consciously consider why a certain conclusion was reached, well, then, boom, that's reasoning. Releasing is the process of making inferences not automatically and instinctively, but by looking at facts and seeing what conclusions they support. When Erratus Thenis calculated the circumference of the Earth to within a percentage or two of the value accepted today, he didn't do it by measuring the Earth and he didn't just perceive it as self-evident. No, he inferred it from what he knew about shadows and how long it took camels to move. Species like that make it easy to believe that reasoning evolved because it supercharged our cognitive abilities. I mean, it clearly moves us towards truer conclusions, better decisions and knowledge no other species could infer. Attempts to describe the rules of good, orderly reason became logic in mathematics, concepts so general and abstract that while we were still animals, armed with them, we were no longer beasts. But that's the rub, isn't it? If reasoning is so great, why are we the only species with such a sophisticated grasp of it? And if its purpose is truth and good judgment, why don't we all agree on everything? It's tempting to think that disagreements happen because, well, I am being rational, but those who disagree with me are being irrational. Ugh! If only people would just use logic and reason! What's happened to the world? Well, that's a fair complaint if you're arguing over logic puzzles, but the world is not a logic puzzle. This, however, is one. Paul is looking at Mary. Mary is looking at Peter. Paul is married. Peter is unmarried. Is a married person looking at an unmarried person? Yes. No. Or not enough information to decide. Think about it. The answer is yes. You may have thought there's no way to know because we don't know if Mary is married, but look, she either is or she isn't. And if she is, well then she, a married person, is looking at Peter, an unmarried person. If she isn't, then Paul, a married person, is looking at her, an unmarried person. So no matter what Mary's deal is, the answer will be yes. When people get this puzzle wrong and the correct answer is explained to them, they almost always immediately see why it's right and change their mind. Life is not always like that. Let's take a look at a logical syllogism. All elephants are awesome. Michael is an elephant. Therefore, Michael is awesome. The conclusion is logically valid. It follows from the assumptions. But are the assumptions true? No. I am not an elephant. Also, this premise is subjective. I mean, what does it mean to be awesome? Can we measure it with an osmometer? So you can see why, when analyzing something like our impact on the planet, logic can only be a partial tool. If some people have more to lose than others, who gets to decide which assumptions are fair? Still though, it would seem that reasoning should be able to help here. If each of us would just attend only to the facts, surely we'd all recognize the same reasonable approach. Problem is, that's not how reasoning works. Since the scientific study of human reasoning began about a hundred years ago, it has been found again and again that not only are we bad at reasoning, lazy and biased, but we actually seem almost programmed to be bad. Like the flaws are intentional. In an episode of Mind Field, I once used a magician to pull off a little experiment. He asked people to look at two faces and choose which of the two they would prefer to work with, placing their preferences in one pile and those they rejected into another. Then the pile of people they picked were shown again and each person was asked to provide a reason for why they chose that person. But with a little sleight of hand, the magician managed to sneak in some of the faces they had just rejected. Amazingly, the majority of people didn't even notice the trick. Not only that, they were able to effortlessly explain the reasons behind their choice. A choice they never actually made. Remembering faces you've only seen briefly isn't the easiest thing to do, but other studies have shown that even if the task involves answering questions about one's political beliefs, things we would seemingly have a firmer grasp on, nearly half of participants will fail to notice that the answers they gave have been reversed when they're later asked to explain them. Point is, we seem practically built to give reasons for whatever we think we must, and not the reasons we actually used to reach a conclusion. What if we don't even use reasons to reach conclusions? Well, let's talk about intuitions. Our brains have evolved over millions of years to react to the world around us in brilliant ways with little to no input from us. For example, when you notice that someone is upset, you don't consciously think, hmm, okay, so, uh, well, their eyebrows are kind of in that position and their speech seems curt, their posture is, huh, these are all reasons to conclude that they are upset. No. Instead, the belief that they may be upset was just apparent, you intuited it, you know it without exactly knowing how you came to know it. The mood-recognizing parts of your brain operate in a way that is opaque to your awareness. But if someone asks you, why do you think they're upset? You can nonetheless produce all sorts of reasons. Some may have actually been the ones your brain attended to, but they're all just guesses. Instead of using reasoning to come to conclusions, we use conclusions to come to reasons. Now, to be fair, we can go the other way. We love puzzles, and when we don't have a strong intuition either way, we can sit down and mull over various reasons to think one thing or another. Our love of puzzles suggests that reasoning has a survival value. Organisms that found it pleasurable would be more likely to use it. But when we reason alone, even when we have no motivation to reach any particular conclusion, we still exhibit deep biases that seem less like mistakes and more like features. For example, it's been shown that between two otherwise similar products, people will prefer to buy the one with more functions, even if they don't want those functions, never plan to use them and think they're all pointless and overly complicated. Why? Well, it might be that we find such decisions easier to justify to others. We won't wind up being potentially embarrassed when someone asks why we didn't get the product with more functions. Well, after decades of findings like this, Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber began to hypothesize that reasoning didn't evolve to help us make better decisions, but instead to help us be social. Humans inhabit a cognitive niche on this planet. We aren't strong or sharp or hidden or venomous. Instead, our advantage comes from cognition, reasoning, and cooperation. We can plan hunts, build traps, and engage in coordinated strategies that can be tested and modified on the fly, not by millennia of evolution. Reason allows us to do those things. It's hard to convince people that your intuitions are true, but if you can give reasons for them, it's a whole heck of a lot easier to convince people that you're right. Being able to argue over what the best thing to do is, is vital when it comes to coordinating action. Reasons also allow us to justify ourselves in the eyes of others, to explain who we are and express the kinds of reasons we like, what others can expect from us, and what we will likely expect from them. This social theory of reasoning helps explain why two people can earnestly and rationally arrive at two different views. They each have their own unique brain and values and dispositions and experiences, and those are what drove their thinking. The reasons they give may or may not be the real reasons they came to their conclusions, but it's the best anyone can do. The social theory also explains why people tend to give such weak reasons for their beliefs at first, or when their intended audience doesn't need much convincing. It would be a waste of time and cognitive resources to construct grand slam reasons for everything I said and did and thought when it wasn't necessary. Instead, I can offload some of that work to other people. For example, if I say, I want to have lunch at ABC burgers, well my friend might respond, ah no thanks, I had burgers yesterday. And I might reply back, oh well that's no problem, they also have hot dogs and great salads. But if my friend said, ah no thanks, I'm trying to spend less money eating out this month, I could reply, oh well ABC burgers is really cheap and I've got a coupon. Now what's going on here is that I'm providing reasons only as my friend presses for them. If they press harder and harder, my reasons will become better and better until either I win them over or we come to some different, more harmonious decision. So when people appear to be lazy reasoners or to have bad reasons or none at all, it's usually just the case that they're using reason as it evolved to function. Socially. It starts off weak, improving if others push it and always tailoring its work to the intended audience. The social theory of reasoning can even explain the existence of biases that otherwise make little sense. For example, it would seem that in coming to conclusions about the world, it would behoove an organism to pay particular attention to information that went against what it believed. I mean, that way, they would be able to adjust their beliefs making them truer, more general and more complete. To a certain extent, that is what happens, but not always. When someone does their own research, they often come to the very conclusion they wanted in the first place. This is called confirmation bias, our tendency to look for, prefer and interpret information so that it confirms what we already think. It frustrates our ability to accept new inconvenient data and is a problem for the intellectualist view of reason. If reason is for finding truth and making better decisions, why would it have this major weakness? Well, because, the social theory says, reasoning is a group activity. Let's say that I think option A is true and the best and you think option B is true and the best. Well, if we both researched both options and sifted through reasons in support of both options, we would both have twice the work to do than we would if instead, I simply came up with reasons for why I was right and you attended to reasons for why you were right. The confirmation bias at least halves the cognitive work that must be done. Now, sometimes a lone reasoner will have a bad idea or a decent idea with some bad parts. The reasons they have to justify for and argue for it will be sufficient for them and those who intuitively agree, but they may be weak. However, subjected to deliberation put forth into the machine of collective thought, it can be evaluated and judged not by one mind or a group of minds thinking alike, but by something very special, the crowd. Humans have long known of the wisdom of the crowds, the phenomenon by which a collection of many people can process information into a conclusion better than any one person could do alone. It's why we don't trust big decisions to a single person, no matter how educated or powerful they are. Instead, we ask a group of people to deliberate, to reason together. In this way, the biases and errors of each is smoothed out and the decision wiser. In a famous example, it's been repeatedly shown that if you ask a bunch of people to guess how many jelly beans are in a jar, you'll find that the average of all their answers is closer to the real number than any one individual was alone. What happens is that although some people may guess a number that is like way too big, that mistake is balanced out by the fact that others will inevitably guess a number that is way too small. Altogether, their disagreement evens out into spectacular accuracy. We have now arrived at the problem. Reasoning evolved to be used socially, where many different perspectives had to all deliberate towards a common conclusion. Such contexts are becoming less and less common, and it is becoming easier and easier to simply be a lone reasoner, justifying only a particular viewpoint without doing the harder work of deliberating and acting. The internet gives voices to more perspectives than ever before in our history, but it also makes it easy to disengage from accountability and to find places where everyone believes what you do. Furthermore, because of technology, we confront more issues more rapidly than ever before that we are expected to have opinions about, and the growing complexity and specialization of the modern world makes it difficult for each of us to have well-informed, prepared reasons for the accelerating accretion of intuitions we must form. In response, we look for people who can defend our intuitions for us. The reasons they give don't have to be good, just good enough that we can feel like justification exists. In the past, unconvincing reasons had to be painted on sandwich boards, but now, the democratization of communication means that even unpopular, unconvincing, nonsensical ideas can be presented with the same trust-inducing typefaces and professional look as common ones. People can challenge the weak reasons of others, show them to be contradictory and produce better reasons for their side, but to what end? It's all preparation for a debate that never comes. We each play a very small role in deciding how society is run. Even if a good-faith discussion between a representative slice of America came to a resolution, if nothing can come of it, why not just throw shade and sick burns or revel in the pleasure of reasoning by treating everything like a big giant puzzle? It's easy to think that it doesn't matter. Because after all, those in charge, the brilliant scientists and powerful billionaires will surely come to the rescue. Some giant techno-salvation is surely on the horizon. Perhaps it is. But everything we know about reason suggests that those implementing it should be held accountable by as many different perspectives as possible. Leaders could lead deliberations and be elected for their ability to moderate social reasoning. But that's boring. Why lead when you could follow? Look at what some people believe and generate reasons for why they're right and they'll love it. Of course, the hard work, the real work, the work that truly elevates us on this planet is not in telling people that they're right, but in trying to convince others and in doing so, use reason as it evolved to be used. The future of reason may in fact be the past of reason. In practice, what does all this look like? Well, some researchers have gone so far as to recommend national deliberation days where citizens celebrate by literally joining small groups and talking through their opinions and comparing reasons. Tests of such strategies have shown that a return to the small targeted discussions our reasoning abilities evolved to excel in leaves all participants with a greater understanding of not just what they believe and why, but about decisions that could actually be made and actions that could be taken. Others have gone even further, recommending that the future of reason at its best is the construction of a lotocracy. A form of government where decisions are made not by elected leaders, but by people literally chosen at random. We decide the fate of a person this way. Why not the fate of the people? What if decisions were made not by politicians alone, but at least occasionally by groups of actual citizens representing differences in thought, not just geography, who were brought together and paid for their time to learn from experts and then deliberate on an assigned issue until a conclusion was reached or at the least a recommendation. Instead of being motivated by reelection, money, attention, and power, individuals chosen at random would have only their conscience to guide them. Special interests and corporations wouldn't be able to cozy up to those likely to be elected because if any one of us could someday serve, they'd have to cozy up to and protect all of us. Instead of the learning and deliberation being done by people you will never meet with offices and buildings you can't access, gradually over time more and more of your very own neighbors would have had the honor. People chosen at random would obviously lack the same celebrity status and mandate that elected leaders cultivate and achieve. And iconic figures we relate to aren't bad, but our understanding of reasoning is making it more and more clear that we evolved not to leave the thinking up to a few great minds, but to the authority of the great mind, the lumbering organ of thought that is everyone and everything. This is, in fact, how democracy first worked. Lotteries were used to fill many political positions in ancient Athens. Aristotle explained that the appointment of magistrates by lot is thought to be democratic, and the election of them is oligarchic. An oligarchy is government by only a small number of people. Look, regardless of how reason is brought back to its social roots, if we can build more and better arenas for deliberation and use them to apply reason properly to hyper objects like the impact of our emissions on the planet, we'll have taught one heck of a lesson to people a hundred, a thousand years in the future. I like to think that although widening participation will be difficult, it might provide us with a kind of existential security. The impact of emissions on our planet is not going to be the last hyper object we face. If we can do a good job with it, maybe far in the future when our civilization has advanced to the point at which, I don't know, people can be quantumly recreated or something, they'll look back at our time and say, hey, let's bring them all back to life. We could use the cooperative abilities they had then. Ultimately, the old saying that history is the great teacher isn't a bad guide. We will all someday be teachers ourselves because someday we will all be history. We will someday be the ancients and we can choose what that will mean. And as always, thanks for watching.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 4325\n","\n","Link  288 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/3teflb1QNN4\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/3teflb1QNN4\n","[youtube] 3teflb1QNN4: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 3teflb1QNN4: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 7.33MiB in 02:10\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And subscribing to Vsauce is a no-brainer. Or is it? I mean, you would need your brain to understand the words that I was speaking. And you would need your brain to decide whether or not you liked what you were hearing. You would also need your brain to move your muscles in just the right way to click the subscribe button. In fact, you need your brain to do a lot of stuff. And without a brain, well, you can't do much of anything at all. So, literally speaking, is there really such a thing as a no-brainer? Let's begin with no headers. Decapitation. It's a macabre subject, I know, but what's the matter? Are you chicken? Okay, good. Because Mike certainly was. In 1945, farmer Lloyd Olsen went out to grab a chicken for supper. He cut the chicken's head off and it didn't die. Mike the headless chicken lived for another 18 months. He toured the country and surprised onlookers. He could walk and perch and was fed by putting little drops of water or pieces of grain down his throat. But here's the thing. Mike the headless chicken's actions weren't a no-brainer. Because even though he didn't have much of what we would call a head left, he did have a bit of his brain stem. If we want a clearer no-brainer, we're going to have to look at an even more simple creature, the cockroach. These guys don't even breathe through their heads, so without one they're fine. Instead, they breathe through holes all over their bodies. And instead of being controlled by a big massive brain, they have little bundles of nerves, ganglia, throughout their body. And so even without any head parts, even when completely decapitated, a cockroach can live for weeks. It can walk around, respond to movement. Really, its only problem is that without its head it will eventually starve to death. Us humans are not nearly as fortunate. Without a head and brain, we die within seconds, if not instantly. But before you get jealous, keep in mind that with our heads in tact, we are capable of some actions that don't necessarily require the brain. Reflexes. When you snap your finger, your finger moves at about 20 miles per hour. And a really big sneeze can expel air at nearly 30 to 40 miles per hour. But nerve impulses, they're really quick. They can clock in at 250 miles per hour. But sometimes that's not even fast enough. For instance, if you accidentally put your hand on a hot stove, cells are dying quickly. And 250 miles per hour doesn't cut it. You need to take an action fast. It's not worth it to tell your brain what's happening right away. And so instead, your immediate reaction to pull away is mediated by other parts of your nervous system. The same can be said for involuntary and unconscious processes. So in a way, these unconscious, involuntary or reflexive behaviors could be considered no-brainers. But I'm not quite satisfied yet because they still require that your brain be there, keeping you alive. So what if you weren't alive? Well, in your dead, brainless body, your muscle cells still contain a little bit of energy in the form of ATP. Backyard brains, right here on YouTube, demonstrates this with insect parts. This leg is no longer connected to a brain or a body, but energy remains in the cells. And so researchers can detect electrical signals when the leg is touched or even simply breathed on. Whoa, that popping sound you're hearing is the spontaneous discharge rate of the living neurons in the still living leg. The muscle cells of a human limb would respond in just the same way. But you don't need wires to observe behavior like this. Salt can also do the trick. The introduction of sodium ions can cause a process similar to an action potential in a living animal. Salt added to these fresh frog legs makes them dance. Though not for very long, the cells will eventually run out of energy or simply decay. But to be sure, there are many other brief candidates for no-brainers at the moment of death. For instance, muscles relaxing causing a person to soil themselves. Technically a no-brainer, but it's a misconception that a corpse continues to grow fingernails and hair. Instead, it's actually the skin itself shrinking as it dries, making hair and nails appear longer. But let's take a closer look at these skin cells because we might be onto a quite satisfactory no-brainer. Your skin cells live on the periphery of your body and they don't require a constant stream of new nutrients from your blood. And so even though you are dead and your brain is no longer calling the shots, your skin cells can continue to live gathering nutrients through osmosis and dividing for days. In fact, you can harvest skin cells from a corpse after 24 hours. On a related note, digestion. Sure, a lot of the digestive process is completed by you being alive and having a nervous system that works. But part of the work is done by bacteria that just happens to live inside your gut. And when you're dead or your brain is gone, they'll continue digesting so in a way making poop, at least part of that process, is a no-brainer. But here's the thing. These bacteria that live inside you are foreign bacteria. Are they you? For that matter, what about the skin cells that can continue to live after you're dead? Are they you or are they merely cells that you have made a good home for? We're getting pretty philosophical here because we're basically asking if you are merely your brain and everything else that goes on when you no longer have one is just other stuff that you aren't doing. You could argue that without a brain, your body no longer has your intentions. It no longer does things because you have decided to do them. In other words, a no-brainer may be impossible for you to do because it requires not using you. If you are merely what your brain does and not what your cells do off on their own when the brain's gone, then in a way, being you, being alive, is a yes-brainer. Another great yes-brainer is checking out Vsauce 3. You can find some scientific video game analysis, some gamer loot, and some pretty cool apps to download.

You said that is the earth flat is one of the favorite questions you've ever answered. Yeah. Speaking of revolutionary ideas. So your video on that people should definitely watch is really fascinating. Can you elaborate why you enjoyed answering this question so much? Yeah, well, it's a long story. I remember a long time ago, I was living in New York at the time, so it had to have been like 2009 or something. I visited the Flat Earth forums and this was before the Flat Earth theories became as sort of mainstream as they are. Sorry to ask the dumb question. Forums, online forums? Yeah, the Flat Earth Society. I don't know if it's dot com or dot org, but I went there and I was reading their ideas and how they responded to typical criticisms of, well, the earth isn't flat because what about this? And I could not tell, and I mentioned this in my video, I couldn't tell how many of these community members actually believe the earth was flat or were just trolling. And I realized that the fascinating thing is how do we know anything and what makes for a good belief versus a maybe not so tenable or good belief. And so that's really what my video about earth being flat is about. It's about, look, there are a lot of reasons. The earth is probably not flat, but a Flat Earth believer can respond to every single one of them. But it's all in an ad hoc way and all of their rebuttals aren't necessarily going to form a cohesive, non-contradictory whole. And I believe that's the episode where I talk about Occam's razor and Newton's flaming laser sword. And then I say, well, you know what, wait a second, we know that space contracts as you move. And so to a particle moving near the speed of light towards earth, earth would be flattened in the direction of that particles travel. So to them, earth is flat. We need to be really generous to even wild ideas because they're all thinking. They're all the communication of ideas. And what else can it mean to be a human? Yeah. And I think I'm a huge fan of the Flat Earth theory, quote unquote, in the sense that to me feels harmless to explore some of the questions of what it means to believe something, what it means to explore the edge of science and so on. It's because it's a harm. It's to me, nobody gets hurt whether the earth is flat around, not literally, but I mean intellectually when we're just having a conversation. That said, again, to elitism, I find that scientists roll their eyes way too fast on the Flat Earth. The kind of dismissal that I see to this even notion, they haven't like sat down and say, what are the arguments that are being proposed? And this is why these arguments are incorrect. So that should be something that scientists should always do, even to the most sort of ideas that seem ridiculous. I like this. It's almost my test when I ask people what they think about Flat Earth theory to see how quickly they roll their eyes. Well, yeah. I mean, let me go on record and say that the earth is not flat. It is a three dimensional spheroid. However, I don't know that and it has not been proven. Science doesn't prove anything. It just reduces uncertainty. Could the earth actually be flat? Extremely unlikely. Extremely unlikely. And so it is a ridiculous notion if we care about how probable and certain our ideas might be. But I think it's incredibly important to talk about science in that way and to not resort to, well, it's true. It's true in the same way that a mathematical theorem is true. And I think we're kind of like being pretty pedantic about defining this stuff. But like, sure, I could take a rocket ship out and I could orbit Earth and look at it and it would look like a ball. But I still can't prove that I'm not living in a simulation, that I'm not a brain in a vat, that this isn't all an elaborate ruse created by some technologically advanced extraterrestrial civilization. So there's always some doubt and that's fine. That's exciting. And I think that kind of doubt, practically speaking, is useful when you start talking about quantum mechanics or string theory. I think if it helps, to me, that kind of adds a little spice into the thinking process of scientists. So I mean, just as a thought experiment, your video kind of, OK, say the Earth is flat. What would the forces when you walk about this flat Earth feel like to the human? That's a really nice thought experiment to think about. Right, because what's really nice about it is that it's a funny thought experiment, because you wind up accidentally learning a whole lot about gravity and about relativity and geometry. And I think that's really the goal of what I'm doing. I'm not trying to convince people that the Earth is round. I feel like you either believe that it is or you don't. And how can I change that? What I can do is change how you think and how you are introduced to important concepts like, well, how does gravity operate? Oh, it's all about the center of mass of an object. So right, on a sphere, we're all pulled towards the middle, essentially the centroid, geometrically, but on a disk, you're going to be pulled at a weird angle if you're out near the edge. And that stuff's fascinating. Yeah, and to me, that particular video opened my eyes even more to what gravity is. It's just a really nice visualization tool because you always imagine gravity with spheres, with masses that are spheres. Yeah. And imagining gravity on masses that are not spherical, some other shape, but here a plate, a flat object is really interesting. It makes you really kind of visualize in a three-dimensional way the force. Yeah, even if a disk, the size of Earth would be impossible. I think anything larger than the Moon, basically, needs to be a sphere because gravity will round it out. So you can't have a teacup the size of Jupiter, right? There's a great book about a teacup in the universe that I highly recommend. I don't remember the author. I forget her name, but it's a wonderful book, so look it up. I think it's called Teacup in the Universe. Just to link on this point briefly, your videos are generally super, people love them, right? If you look at the sort of number of likes versus dislikes, this measure of YouTube, right, is incredible, and as do I. But this particular Flat Earth video has more dislikes than usual. What do you, on that topic in general, what's your sense, how big is the community, not just who believes in Flat Earth, but sort of the anti-scientific community that naturally distrusts scientists in a way that's not an open-minded way, like really just distrust scientists like they're bought by some kind of mechanism of some kind of bigger system that's trying to manipulate human beings. What's your sense of the size of that community? You're one of the sort of great educators in the world that educates people on the exciting power of science, so you're kind of up against this community. What's your sense of it? I really have no idea. I haven't looked at the likes and dislikes on the Flat Earth video, and so I would wonder if it has a greater percentage of dislikes than usual, is that because of people disliking it because they think that it's a video about Earth being flat and they find that ridiculous and they dislike it without even really watching much? Do they wish that I was more dismissive of Flat Earth theories? Yeah. That's possible too. I know there are a lot of response videos that kind of go through the episode and are pro-Flat Earth, but I don't know if there's a larger community of unorthodox thinkers today than there have been in the past. Okay. And I just want to not lose them. I want them to keep listening and thinking, and by calling them all idiots or something, that is no good because how idiotic are they really? I mean, the Earth isn't a sphere at all. We know that it's an oblate spheroid, and that in and of itself is really interesting, and I investigated that in which way is down, where I'm like, really, down does not point towards the center of the Earth. It points in different direction depending on what's underneath you and what's above you and what's around you. The whole universe is tugging on me. And then you also show that gravity is non-uniform across the globe. Like if you, there's this, I guess, thought experiment, if you build a bridge all the way across the Earth and then just knock out its pillars, what would happen? Yeah. And you describe how it would be like a very chaotic, unstable thing that's happening because gravity is non-uniform throughout the Earth. Yeah. In small spaces like the ones we work in, we can essentially assume that gravity is uniform. Right. But it's not. It is weaker the further you are from the Earth, and it also is going to be, it's radially pointed towards the middle of the Earth. So a really large object will feel tidal forces because of that non-uniformness. And we can take advantage of that with satellites, right? Gravitational induced torque. It's a great way to align your satellite without having to use fuel or any kind of engine.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1671\n","\n","Link  291 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/fXW-QjBsruE\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/fXW-QjBsruE\n","[youtube] fXW-QjBsruE: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] fXW-QjBsruE: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 35.09MiB in 11:35\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Hey Vsauce, Michael here. And here. Michael here. Hey Vsauce, what is here? What is there? What is there? What really exists? Do waves exist? Or are there just things that are wavy? When does a piece of food stop being a piece of food and become me? Do chairs exist? Ontology is the philosophy of existence, and chairs are what philosophers call ordinary objects. Ordinary objects are the plain old common sense things we deal with every day. Spoons, buckets, rocks, stuff like that. Their existence is as obvious as possible. But the more we try to suss out where they are, the more suss they become. First of all, sure, this could all be a dream. Maybe we've all been hallucinating chairs all these years. Or this could be part of the simulated reality pumped into our brains while our bodies are harvested for energy. But underneath that skepticism, there's a deeper ontological question we need to answer first. Regardless of whether this spoon is made of real atoms or simulated atoms, is it really possible to be made of something? Take a look at these two things. As we all know, 2 minus 1 is 2? There are two things here. There's an origami crane and a piece of paper. I'm just kidding, of course. There's just one thing. The crane and the paper are the same. But watch this. Where'd the crane go? If the paper and the crane were truly identical, they would share everything in common. But clearly, they don't. The paper can survive being unfolded and the crane cannot. Also, I made the crane, but I didn't make the paper. And the paper was around before the crane. You know, for two things that are the same, they sure are different. This relationship is called constitution. Paper constitutes the crane. It's a one-to-one relationship. But there's another kind of being made of going on here, too. This paper, for example, is made not of one other thing, but of sextillions of things. Fundamental subatomic particles, electrons and quarks, or strings, or physical and virtual fields. This many-to-one relationship is called composition. Philosophers call whatever it is that matter is ultimately composed of symbols. A symbol is a thing that, unlike a piece of paper, has no parts, no substructure, not even a top or bottom. Now, it could be the case that there are no symbols, that there's just a never-ending chain of smaller and smaller substructure. Philosophers call such a reality a gunky universe. If structure never ends in the other direction and everything turns out to be part of something bigger with no final complete composite, that is known as a junky universe. Point is, believing ordinary objects exist and are made up of smaller things is quite common. It's called ontological reductionism. It's the position that holes are nothing more than their parts. But our crane and our paper challenge that notion. It seems like being made of some things is different than just being those things. Let's agree on what it means to exist. Let's say that for something to exist is simply for there to be more than zero of it. So Pegasus exists if we mean, are there any winged horses in works of fiction and mythology? And Pegasus does not exist if we mean, are there any physical, flesh-and-blood winged horses that evolved on Earth through natural selection? Okay, so if we can agree on that, then of course chairs exist. There's this one right here. I can see it and I can feel it and I can taste it. Yeah. Oh, yeah. It's kind of dry and a little bit salty. Dry and salty are what we call properties. Properties tell us what things are like. For example, this slice of cheese is floppy. By noticing and sharing properties, we can let each other know what to expect from things. And we all more or less agree on what things there are. We give names to stuff and if they catch on, we put them in dictionaries with the word noun next to them. But are all of these nouns an inventory of the universe or an inventory of things we made? Let me put it this way. Do islands exist? Well, it's in the dictionary and a quick look around confirms that there are more than zero islands. So, yes, islands exist. But what about in cars? An in car is a car that is in a garage. As a car leaves a garage, an in car diminishes at the threshold until it collapses into non-existence. Later, an extremely similar in car may emerge at the same threshold when the car returns. Are there any cars in garages right now? Well, if so, then in cars exist. But you might be thinking, ah, that's not a thing. You just made that up. And it's silly. Being in a garage is just a property that a car can have. Stop trying to make in cars a thing. Okay, but first of all, I didn't make it up. Eli Hirsch did. And second of all, if you think in cars aren't things, wait until you hear about islands. An in car might just be a relation between a car and a garage, but an island is just a relation between land and some water. Now, of course, island might be a more useful concept than in car, but does that make islands objectively more real than in cars? And what about trogs? A trog is an object whose parts are a tree and whatever dog is nearest. Here's a picture of one. Do you see the trog? This is its tree part and this is its dog part. You might be thinking, come on, how can that be a thing? The tree and the dog aren't even connected. Well, so what? These two pieces of fabric aren't connected and yet they are a thing called a bikini. Now, sure, if we cut down this tree and burn it for warmth, we don't feel the need to apologize to what's left of the trog for destroying its tree part, but maybe we should? What if some extraterrestrials showed up and said they thought dogs and trees composed trogs? Would they be wrong? Could we convince them otherwise? Ontological realists believe that we could, that there really is a mind-independent answer to the question, what is there? People like Theodore Sider believe that the universe has joints and that we can cut up reality into objective, real things by finding them. Ontological anti-realists disagree. Their position is that what we think there is is just one way to cut up reality. It's a good one for us and our needs, but it's not objectively more true than any other. So who's right? Hmm. Well, if these blocks compose a tower, what do they compose now? Just because we don't have a name for this doesn't necessarily mean I haven't accidentally built something, does it? When do two or more things compose something else? Peter van Inwagen calls this the special composition question. In Material Beings, he considers possible answers. Maybe things compose something only when they're in contact. Well, that's a good thought, but it doesn't explain how a bikini can be a thing or why two books are still just two books when one is stacked on top of the other. You know, maybe a certain degree of fixation is required or a melding. If a surgeon sewed us together and the skin healed with no seam and we shared the same blood supply, you know, even then, it would seem wrong to say that we'd become some new kind of animal. There'd still just be me and you, but like, stuck together. The philosophy of parts and wholes is called mereology, and mereological universalism is the belief that there is an answer to the special composition question. And the answer is this, any assortment of stuff, no matter how strange or scattered across time and space, composes a thing. Some pages compose these books, but I don't just have two books here. Oh no, there's also a third thing. Let's call it a took, because its parts are two books. There is also something composed of my left ear, the northern third of every brown trout in England, and the Eiffel Tower. Just because it doesn't have a name, and no one's ever talked about it before, just shows a lack of interest on our part. To a universalist, eliminating some composites but not others is just too arbitrary. We may as well accept them all. Modernism is any belief that accepts some composites but eliminates others. Peter van Inwagen, for example, believes that there are no ordinary objects. No chairs or shirts or shoes. Right here, there are just some symbols, atoms or whatever, arranged shoe-wise. There isn't something else here called a shoe. But he thinks that because people believe that they themselves exist, and he can't see how something could believe it existed without existing in the first place to even think that, there must be people. He goes further, though, to argue that all living things exist. While admitting he doesn't have any knockdown arguments in their favor, he mentions that because symbols that are part of a living organism maintain the organism, while shedding some members and gaining others, all while remaining individuated from other organisms, unlike, say, waves of water at the moment of collision, clearly, symbols in the act of a life must compose something. That position is called organicism. It's been called the belief that people exist, but none of them wear clothes. Mereological nihilism is less generous. It's the belief that there are no trogs or encars or dogs or trees, because nothing ever composes. Now, the nihilist does not believe that there is nothing here. There are lots of symbols. But that's it. Now, that might sound puzzling. How can a bunch of fundamental particles arranged into atoms and molecules that are arranged like this not be a chair? I mean, that's just what a chair is. Well, good question. Let's call that deflationism. The belief that this is all silly and that all these positions are just talking past one another. I mean, they all agree on what reality contains. They all believe that there are symbols here and that those symbols are arranged into a chair shape. And since that's just what a chair is, they all believe in chairs. Those who say they don't are just being weird and contrarian. Deflationism has many supporters and it truly is the heart of our issue today. But to address it, we should first see why it would be nice if all these parts did not form a chair. Let's begin with over-determination. If chairs really do exist, shouldn't they be able to interact with us? The thing is, though, everything this alleged chair can do can be described by referencing the behavior of symbols here and any other symbols that happen to come along. And the count of the activities of every atom in this room leaves nothing for the chair to explain. Composites are causally redundant. Believing in chairs is like believing that while, yes, the burning gas from my stove completely describes why the water in the pot boils, there's also a magical invisible substance called boil-o that comes out of my stove and does the same thing as the flame at the same time and if there was no boil-o, the flame would warm the water just the same, but there is boil-o. Chairs are no more real than boil-o. Composites over-determine what happens in the world. They also lead to over-counting. For more on that, let's say hello to this video's sponsor. Hi, I'm Michael Stevens. You may know me from such films as Lady Gaga, Judas Parody, Key of Awesome number 42, and the Emoji Movie, but today I'm here to talk to you about the Curiosity Box. This season, our subscribers will be receiving many things, including a shirt celebrating the Sherman Line, a kit to find out what kind of bacteria grows on you, a puzzle that celebrates the average color of Neptune, and yes, also Uranus, and the first ever at-home demonstration of impossible colors. And right now, if you subscribe with code BOGO, we'll also send you our entire summer box completely free. Just pay shipping. How many things will you be receiving for this one ridiculously low price? Well, you might think 15. Eight things plus seven things. But don't forget that you're also getting this entire collection and this entire collection. That's 17 things. Order now. That's a good deal. But the ontology seemed wrong. If I count some parts, I shouldn't also count the whole they compose. But if you believe in composite objects, you must, right? I mean, after all, the composite exists. So if this chair contains, say, 100 sextillion atoms, then there are actually at least 100 sextillion and one things here. All of the atoms and also the chair. That seems wrong. But wait, there's more. If I take a knife and scrape off a tiny part of this chair, is it still a chair? I think most of us would say that yes, it is still a chair and it would still be a chair even if I removed a tiny bit again. And again, a series of tiny innocuous removals is called a sorites sequence. The trouble they cause is that while it seems we must accept that each individual step doesn't annihilate the chair, clearly enough minute removals will eventually leave us with no chair. Nothing at all, in fact. But how can that be? How can subtracting zero over and over again ever give a different result? Well, clearly, there must be a point at which a tiny change does make a difference. Now, different people might give different answers as to where that line is, but, you know, we could just stipulate the boundaries. We could define chair in some extremely precise way. If we did that, if we defined the shape, function, and history that makes something a chair so precisely that even the smallest deviation could make or break its status as a chair, how could we know if we'd done it right? If we called up God and said, hey, hey, dude, watch this, okay, see this chair? Well, okay, now we're going to remove a single atom from it. Ta-da! It's no longer a chair, is it? Would God be like, pfft, correct? You guys nailed it. That is exactly right. It was a chair before, and now, in my infinite wisdom, I can confirm that that single atom was exactly what made the difference. Unless there's some explanation for why a boundary should be drawn in a precise way instead of some other way, our stipulations are just arbitrary. Ordinary objects may be unredeemably vague. But being vague may actually be a feature of ordinary objects. For example, how many people is a crowd? Ten people standing together in a huge empty park might be more of like a group, but ten people standing further apart in a tiny waiting room will feel way more crowded. The fact that our terms depend on context, that they're plastic, makes it seem less and less like they're describing things and more and more like they're pragmatic, that rather than telling us what there is, they tell us what to expect. Peter Unger has pointed out that there's at least one kind of thing that can survive a sorority's sequence without paradox. Stuff. If you innocuously remove tiny pieces from something that is just some stuff, you will still have some stuff after each step until you reach a clear and unambiguous boundary. When the last piece is removed, there will no longer be any stuff. This might show that there are composite objects. Stuff. As soon as we pretend that some stuff is a thing, though, vagueness sets in. Suddenly, we're talking about a thing that can lose parts but also can't lose parts, and unless contradictions can exist, words like chair just don't really refer to anything in the universe. Sorority's sequences lead to other problems, too, like the problem of the many. If removing a tiny number of atoms from this chair leaves me with a chair, well, how many chairs are here? Okay, there's this one, but then there's also this one, which is really similar to the first but it doesn't have these atoms on top of it. You know, I don't have to remove atoms for this to be a problem. All I have to do is try to define which atoms here are part of the chair and which aren't. At the atomic level, there isn't a definite boundary near the edge. It will be hard to tell whether a particular molecule is part of the moisture in the chair or part of the ambient humidity. Instead of there being a single chair here, it seems like really there are billions and billions of candidates for the chair. Which one is the chair? But now, suppose that instead of removing pieces, like in a sorority sequence, or choosing pieces, like in the problem of the many, we instead discard pieces and replace them with new, similar pieces. This is the setup to the famous ship of Vesius paradox. Suppose I buy a boat and name it Vesius. Over time, parts of the boat wear out and I replace them with brand new parts. After say, 10 years, well, I might realize that not a single part of my boat was part of the boat on the day I bought it. Do I now own a different boat? Have I owned two boats? But now suppose that someone has been following me around all these years and has been picking up each old part I throw out and storing them away in a warehouse. After I've replaced all the original parts, they take them and join them back the way they were 10 years ago. Which boat is Vesius? Both? If we conclude that ordinary objects don't exist, the problems of sororities, the many, Vesius, overdetermination, and overcounting all evaporate. If there are only symbols and they never compose anything, then which one is the ship of Vesius is easy to answer. Neither. Neither are the boat and nothing ever was the boat. All that happened was that some symbols got moved around. The symbols the scavenger has are the symbols I possessed when I bought the boat, but there's no mystery of persistence. Removing or exchanging a piece of stuff never left me with the same stuff. There's also no mystery as to which of the billions of chair candidates here is the chair. And the removal of no specific atoms will ever stop it from being a chair because there is no chair here. And there never was. There are only symbols arranged chair-wise. The illusion that there are composites that can survive changes in their parts is an artifact of our minds. It's a helpful one that allows us to track certain properties and ignore others, but when taken seriously, it obviously is not really how the universe works. And that's okay. We shouldn't be embarrassed when we talk about boats or chairs. Our words for ordinary objects really do refer to actual phenomena and therefore are more correct than believing that, say, the sun turned into a black hole yesterday. Unlike the false statement that chairs exist, there is no evidence that saying the sun turned into a black hole yesterday could even be incorrectly describing. Because of this, Trenton Merrick's calls the belief in ordinary objects false, but nearly as good as true. This is all silly though, right? I mean, of course there are chairs. If you believe that there are some symbols arranged chair-wise, then you admit there's a chair, because that just is what a chair is. It's not some additional thing over and above these symbols. It just is them. Each is still an atom or electron or whatever, but together they are a chair. Well not so fast there, chair lover. What do you mean a chair is symbols arranged chair-wise? The phrase, symbols arranged chair-wise, just picks out these symbols. There's nothing else for that phrase to refer to. There aren't these symbols and then also some other symbols that are the symbols arranged chair-wise. So do you mean that chair is a disguised plural? That it refers to lots of things, just like the phrase these books? Because these books only commits us to the existence of this book and this book, but not an additional object that's called a these books. Likewise, if chair just means this simple and this simple and that simple, well then it points to a whole bunch of things and not one of them is a chair. Sure, chairs exist if by chair we mean a word for all these symbols, but if by chair we mean an actual object in the universe, there just aren't any, my friend. Except, maybe there is no chair over and above the symbols, but instead something happens when an assortment of symbols are arranged into a chair shape. Each member continues to be a single atom or whatever, but collectively they all simultaneously become one thing, a chair. Okay, so then either there's no chair here, just symbols, or somehow a miraculous contradiction has appeared, many things, and also one thing that despite both clearly differing in that respect are still identical. It looks like chairs cannot be identical to the parts they're supposedly composed of, but chairs also can't be different from their composite parts because there's nothing else there, and after counting and accounting for their parts, there's nothing left for the existence of a chair to cause or explain. To rescue chairs from non-existence, we need to find a way to show that a chair is independent of its atoms and therefore distinct from them, but not so distinct that it's impossibly over and above them. We need to find a way to make chairs ontologically innocent, to have our cake and not have it too. Amy Thomason does this in a very clever way. She points out that if I ask you, hey, is there anything in the fridge? And you look inside and see that it's empty and say, there's nothing in it. It would be weird if I came over, looked inside myself, found a single eyelash in the corner and said, um, excuse me, what is this? You said there was no thing in the fridge, but there was an eyelash. And gosh dang it, the whole thing is actually full of air. Now that would be weird because when I asked if there was anything in the fridge, it was implied that I meant anything to eat. By arguing that the empty fridge is not really empty, I was using the word thing in what Thomason calls a neutral sense. I used it to mean any and all entities that could possibly be described. But you took me to be using thing in what she calls a sortle sense. A sortle is a term that tells us what a thing is in a way that allows us to count how many there are and know when there is or isn't one. Water is not a sortle. If I told you there was water in my basement and you asked how many waters, I'd have to use a sortle to answer you. For example, gallons of water. Thomason argues that the neutral use of thing is meaningless when used to ask questions. For example, if I used thing in a neutral sense and asked how many orange things are in this video, you would have no idea how I wanted you to carve it all up. Thus there would be no single correct answer. You might say, uh, one orange thing? Your shirt? But then I could say, what? No, there's my left sleeve, my right sleeve, the inside of the shirt, the outside of the shirt, come on, there's way more than one. Unless we use sortles, any search for what things there are will end in confusion. Not because there are no things, but because it hasn't been made clear what conditions to apply when searching. For Thomason, this means that what we find depends on what application conditions we use. If I ask if there's anything here that the condition smaller than a molecule applies to, you could note each such thing and give me an inventory. Chair would not be on that list. But if I asked you if there were any medium-sized, rigid according to human strength things here, chair would probably go on your list and no single atom would. If an application condition is satisfied in the world, then the thing it describes exists. So chairs do exist. If the application conditions for one thing are also sufficient for something else, then if we find the first thing, we have found the other because its existence is entailed analytically by the existence of the first thing, that is, by meaning and logic alone. For example, if I say that I live in a house, you can conclude without looking that I live in a building. There's no paradox here. I don't live in a house and a building, two distinct things that defy the laws of physics by being co-located. Instead, the conditions that apply to a house are also sufficient for a building. So a single chair is not impossibly identical to some collection of many, nor is it somehow over and above its parts. Instead, atoms arranged chair-wise merely logically entail a chair. The entailment connects things differentiated by distinct application conditions. When we ask, which one is the ship of Theseus, a puzzle erupts because we're being too neutral. We need to say what we mean by ship of Theseus. If we mean the original parts, then this is it. Do we mean the thing registered to me by the boat authorities? Well, then it's this one. But which is the real one is an incomplete pseudo question. When it comes to sorority sequences, I think we need to just stipulate where the boundary is. I don't think there's an objective answer provided by the universe or God as to what exactly is and is not a chair. But that doesn't have to mean that there aren't any chairs. It can just mean that every single collection of symbols is its own unique object, independent of our minds, and that we get to decide which to call chairs. Vagueness comes from our minds and our language, but there are no vague objects in the universe. We don't have to believe that our reality is simulated, but I do think we have to believe that it's stipulated. It is a reality that contains not what intelligent machines have decided to give us, but what we have decided we have. There's no fact of the matter as to whether calling this a star is the true way to carve up this stuff. It's a pretty useful way to do it and helpful for at least human purposes, but star is a thing we imposed on the world. As Michael Jubian puts it, there are no things, but as a consequence, there are as many things as we like. Now, as for the problem of the many, we can simply just admit that there really are billions of slightly different chairs here. Some include a few boundary atoms that others don't, but since they all act and react pretty much in unison, in our daily lives, it just doesn't matter which exact material collection we mean when we say this chair. However, let's go back to our cranes. When we talked about holes, we said that holes might be ontologically parasitic, that their existence seems to require the existence of something else, something that can host the hole. Perhaps our crane is wholly too. Not a physical thing in its own right, but a disturbance in some paper. There is no material crane here, there's only some paper arranged crane-wise. But once we start entertaining that notion, we realize that nearly everything we see and feel, all ordinary objects and even ourselves, are ontological parasites. Michael Jubian calls our tendency to think that what is true of a chair is true of the material that is chairing object fixation or property repression. Object fixation is useful and nearly as good as true, but when paradoxes loom, we should remember that while chairs do exist, they are not made out of matter and cannot be touched or felt or tasted. All I can do is taste some stuff while it chairs. If it looks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it's not a duck, but it is arranged duck-wise. I think that the only concrete physical things in our universe are samples. Or since our universe could be gunky, the material world only contains stuff. And yes, this stuff is chairing, but the road paved by the idea that that makes this stuff a chair leads to paradox. To see how we could have made that mistake, let's remember the famous Clintonian dictum that often, it depends on what the meaning of is is. There's the is of predication, which tells us what something is like, as in, this cheese is floppy. And then there's the is of identity, which tells us what is the same as what. For example, 2 plus 2 is 4. To believe that chairs are made of matter, to believe that you are made of matter, is to confuse these two iss. When a collection of properties are extremely thorough in telling us what to expect from some stuff, we tend to just go ahead and noun them, collapse them into a single word, and believe it doesn't just describe some stuff, but refers to it. I think we have an intuitive sense of the thoroughness of properties, and this can be seen in how we order our adjectives. Big can mean many things. A big diamond and a big house are very different in size. Blue tells me a bit more about what to expect, but cheeseburger? Oh, that's specific. So specific, in fact, that we call it a noun. The increasing thoroughness may be partly responsible for the fact that big blue cheeseburger sounds fine, but blue big cheeseburger sounds kind of weird. When we embrace the idea that cheeseburgers are not physical objects, but instead exist as an abstract set of properties, like juicy, warm, soft, and so on, the specter of ontological paradox dissipates. You and I are not physical objects either. Michaeling is a bunch of different properties, and most of them are very vague. They include things like knowing who Kevin is, being more or less a certain height, having a roughly continuous relationship with the stuff that was Michaeling yesterday. Some of what it means to Michael does concern composition, like the fact that I will still exist even if I shave off the stuff I call my beard. If I shaved off my beard, there would still be some stuff Michaeling, but it would be different stuff than it was before. We are able to lose parts and change and grow because we are not made of matter. We are hosted by matter. As Alan Watts would say, the universe doesn't contain people. The universe peoples. Chairs and tables and rocks and buckets and people are not made of atoms. They are performed by atoms. We are disturbances in stuff, and none of it is us. This stuff right here is not me. It's just me. We are not the universe seeing itself. We are the seeing. I am not a thing that dies and becomes scattered. I am death and I am the scattering. And as always, thanks for watching.

And when the pyramids of Giza were built, the tallest was 147 meters tall, making them the tallest things humans had ever built. And they remained that way for nearly 4,000 years. It wasn't even until the 1300s that we finally got around to making something taller, a cathedral in England. So, does that mean that the great pyramids of Giza are the best, tallest structures of all time? Well, to find out more, all aboard the boat. So, what is a building? Well, technically, a building is a structure in which at least 50% of its height comes from floor plates where people can live, work, chill out. It has to be habitable. Any less than that, and it's not a building, it's a tower. After the Lincoln Cathedral finally surpassed the height of the pyramids, a number of churches continued to be built that kept breaking and setting new records. The next long-term record holder was the Eiffel Tower. It was the tallest thing ever in history that we had built for about 40 years in a row. It was finally surpassed by the Chrysler Building in New York, a personal favorite, which was then quickly bested by the Empire State Building. Now, the Empire State Building is interesting in that it was the first structure ever built by man that was so tall, were you to jump off the top of it, you would actually reach terminal velocity before you hit the bottom. It was the first structure we'd ever built that was so tall, rather than just continuing to accelerate as you fell, you would actually stop accelerating because you would reach the fastest possible speed your limp body can fall at. In the mid-1950s, something weird started to happen. Humans started to build radio and TV towers. These things could be way taller than the buildings that we'd made previously that had to be habitable. And so, ever since the Empire State Building had its record broken by a TV tower, all these other famously tall buildings, the Petronas Towers, Taipei 101, the World Trade Center, the Willis Tower, formerly Sears Tower, none of them have ever within their existence actually held the title for being the tallest thing we've ever built. There was always a radio or TV tower somewhere that was taller. Up until quite recently, and for quite a while, the record for the tallest thing ever built by humans went to the Warsaw Radio Mast in Poland. It's visually incredibly striking because there aren't any other skyscrapers around it. It's all alone being very tall. Well, that was until 1991, where some workers exchanging guy wires made a mistake and the whole thing started to bend and then snapped in the middle. There's no video of the event happening, but it would have been similar to this collapse, though much, much taller. After the Warsaw Radio Mast collapsed, the KVLY-TV Mast in North Dakota became the tallest still standing structure built by man. But, recently, buildings have made a comeback, and to check that out, we're gonna have to travel to the Middle East. This is the first time I've ever touched the Nile. Ta-da! Okay, so that was me dipping my waterproof camera into the Nile. If you were to take the entire length of the Nile River and stand it up on its edge perpendicular to the Earth, it would reach into outer space about this far. It's pretty impressive. But where does the space shuttle orbit and where does the International Space Station orbit? This far away? This far away? Maybe this far away. Actually, if this pink inflatable horrible boss's ball was the Earth, the space shuttle would orbit about right there. It's incredible, but it's possible because the shuttle and the International Space Station travel so quickly. They travel so quickly around the Earth that instead of seeing one sunrise and sunset every 24 hours, they see 16. But don't be jealous. You can easily see more than one sunrise and or sunset in a day by taking advantage of tall structures. So let's take a look at the tallest structure, the current record holder for the tallest thing humans have ever built, the Burj Khalifa in Dubai. The height of this building blows my mind. You can literally watch the sunset from the base of the building and then take a super fast elevator all the way up to the top and watch the same sunset again. In fact, the difference in timing between sunset at the base and the top is so significant the Dubai Islamic Affairs Department actually had to make a ruling about when you can start and break your fast during Ramadan inside the building. People above floor 80 or higher have to actually wait to start eating two to three minutes after the people at the base because the sun hasn't yet set for those at the top. But before you head to Dubai to watch the sunrise or set twice in a day, keep in mind that the only height you actually need to see two sunrises or sunsets is the height of your own body. Try this the next time you're at a beach. Watch the sun rise or set over the water. Water is important because it won't have the terrain and hill issues that land does. Now let's say you're watching a sunset. Begin by laying on your stomach. Watch the sunset and as soon as the very last little bit of the sun goes below the horizon, quickly pop up into a standing position and voila. You'll see the sun's back, part of its back and it will set another time. If you take a stopwatch and record the time between the first setting and the second setting that you witness and measure the height of your eyes when you're laying down and when you're standing, you can use those numbers to calculate the radius of the Earth. XKCD took this a little bit further by proposing the double sunset date. Take your date out to the beach in a cherry picker and sure enough it was calculated. Given the speed of a cherry picker, all you have to do is move about six feet up and you can watch a beautiful sunset all over again. To put things in perspective, the Burj Khalifa is nowhere near as tall as Mount Everest. But the tallest structure that we could potentially build wouldn't be as tall as Mount Everest. It would be way, way taller, like into space taller. Of course, the problem with building things that are really tall is that they get heavier and heavier and have to support their own weight. But only up to a point. If a structure was so tall that it wound up at the altitude of a geostationary orbit, it would start to feel a new force, not just a gravitational force downward, but all of a sudden this new centrifugal force up and outward. And so a building that tall could be stable through tension and more than 35,000 kilometers high. This kind of structure is known as a space elevator. Unfortunately, there aren't any materials known to science today that are strong enough to make building something that large feasible. With the exception, maybe, of carbon nanotubes or boron nitride nanotubes. Of course, if we went to a smaller celestial body like the Moon, we could build one today out of stuff like Kevlar. There are a lot of different things that we have to be wary of when we build a space elevator. For instance, how do we dodge space debris? One solution is to attach the Earth side of the cable to a boat in the ocean that can maneuver around and move the elevator away from dangerous obstacles. Another interesting point is that the taller the cable, the faster the far end of it will be traveling. In fact, if the cable is more than 50,000 kilometers long, its far end will be traveling near escape velocity and simply walking outside could take you to the Moon. But why build a space elevator? Well, because it would be awesome. But also for better reasons too. For instance, right now, in order to send a pound of material into orbit, it costs about $11,000. But with a space elevator, we could send the same amount of material into orbit for only about $100. That difference is so significant that Philip Reagan has said that the first country to deploy a space elevator will have a 95% cost advantage and will possibly be able to control all space-related activities.

Michael here. And bananas are fantastic. They're actually one of the most radioactive foods we regularly eat. Sometimes they're difficult to peel from the top. One of my favorite ways to avoid that is to simply hold the banana and snap it in half. Boom. Now it peels itself. It's a wonderful little trick, except when you drop it on the ground. This is unfortunate. But if I picked it up quickly, would it be safe enough to eat? I mean, how quickly did the bacteria on the floor move onto the food? Some people call it the five-second rule. Others, the ten-second rule. And still others, the two-second rule. But is there any truth to it? Or is it just something that we say to allow us to eat food off the floor? In 2003, Jillian Clark famously investigated this question. She found that 50 percent of men use the five-second rule to eat food off the ground. But 70 percent of women do. More importantly, she found that even brief contact with a contaminated floor will contaminate food wet or dry. The Mythbusters found similar results, and a paper published in the Journal of Applied Microbiology got even more technical. The researchers contaminated various floor surfaces with salmonella, and they found that five seconds is way too long to wait. Bacteria adhere to dropped food almost immediately, but time does matter. After five seconds, they found that the food had acquired anywhere from 150 to 8,000 bacteria. But if left for a full minute, the number they found was 10 times greater. Now considering it only takes about 10 bacteria of certain strains of salmonella to infect you, you should probably think twice before eating off the ground. Oh, and don't complacently think that you're safe because the floor looks clean or the food that fell on it does. Floors make great homes for bacteria. Also, floors come in contact with the bottoms of our shoes, and the University of Arizona has found that 93 percent of our shoes are contaminated with fecal bacteria. I've linked all of these studies down in the description. They're great reads, very thorough. But is it true that food dropped on a dirty floor becomes contaminated immediately? I mean, sure, practically speaking, that makes a lot of sense, but instantly? Is there a limit to how quickly bacteria can move from one object to another? Is there an amount of time, short enough, that were I to pick the food up within it, there would be no way for what it touched to contaminate it? Well, we're going to need to define touch. I've talked about this before on Vsauce and on THNKR, and minute physics has a great quantum perspective. But when we say touch, we tend to think of two objects contacting each other with no space in between. Unfortunately, that's not really what happens. At a subatomic level, atoms resist smashing together because their electrons repel. Electrons can be modeled as waves, waves that overlap and interact, but they never touch. There's always space between them. When I touch something or someone, I'm really just feeling their electrons react to mine at a distance, a subatomically small one, but a real one. So if that's the case, how come glue can stick things together? How come lipstick sticks to lips? And how can bacteria on a dirty floor stick to food that's been dropped on it? The positive charge from the protons in an atom or molecule isn't always balanced perfectly in space by the negative charge from electrons. Sometimes a molecule is asymmetrical and this imbalance is permanent, which gives the molecule a constant dipole, so it's like a tiny little magnet. But even in symmetrical molecules, electrons are mobile. At any one point in time, they might happen to find themselves more towards one end of a molecule than the other, creating rapidly fluctuating dipoles, causing the molecule to act like a magnet. If molecules have a lot of energy, they will simply whiz by one another and their dipoles and those of their neighbors won't matter much. But if you cool them down, slow them down, the dipoles will have more of an effect, which is why molecules tend to stick together as they cool, going from a gas to a liquid to a solid. That's a lot of information about molecules, but it's incredibly important. It's the reason things can get wet. In fact, when you get out of the shower, you on average weigh about one pound more than you did before you got wet. It's also the reason capillary action happens. If you dip a napkin in a glass of water, you can watch the water climb up the napkin against gravity. That's because the molecules of water have very strong dipoles and they're attracted to each other, cohesion, and they're attracted to the molecules of the paper, adhesion, more strongly than gravity pulls them down. If you want to learn more about intermolecular forces, I've put a bunch of links down in the description. But here's my question. How quickly do those forces act? Can two surfaces come into contact briefly enough that their molecules don't have time to be influenced by intermolecular forces? Well, for this, we're going to need molecular dynamics. Molecular dynamics is the computer simulation of the physical movements of atoms or molecules. For instance, this is a simulation of a single copper atom depositing on a copper surface. Notice that the timer up there is counting off hundredths of a picosecond. These simulations need to have a narrow enough time step to account for the fastest molecular vibrations of the material, including everything from wagging to scissoring. Typically, time as brief as a quadrillionth of a second is taken into account. So, the five-second rule may be true if we rename it the one femtosecond rule. Spend less time on the floor than that and it's unlikely that room temperature molecules would have time to be influenced by intermolecular forces. Except, oops, I think we've been thinking too small. Intermolecular forces are fun, but objects can become entangled with each other on a macroscopic level. Glue and makeup and other sticky stuff often take advantage of the tiny imperfections, ridges, and nooks and crannies on an object's surface. Sticky things can seep inside and hold on. Even surfaces that seem smooth to us when you really get down to it aren't smooth at all. Two sheets of paper from a phone book may slide across each other quite easily, but multiply that friction by the number of pages in two phone books, by interleaving the pages, and you've got yourself a monster capable of lifting an entire car. I was recently lucky enough to see this happen in real life. You can check out my adventure over on Fast, Furious, and Funny. It's a new channel. Stay tuned because we lifted cars with more than just phone books. The adhesion between two objects caused by these shapes of their surfaces contributes to friction and is known as mechanical adhesion. It plays a pretty big role in getting floor germs to stick to dropped food. In fact, if two surfaces can mechanically adhere but aren't close enough to do so, we wouldn't say they were touching. And so if by definition touching means that you can mechanically adhere to the other object's surface, well, then maybe the five-second rule shouldn't be known as the one femtosecond rule, because if they're touching, it's already too late. And instead the rule should be known as the don't touch food that's fallen on the floor rule. But come to think of it, maybe we shouldn't be eating food that's touched anything, because bacteria are everywhere, including on you right now. There are more bacteria on your body right now than there are people living in America. There are 40 million bacteria in one gram of soil and five non-million bacteria on Earth. It's been found that one out of every ten bank cards and one out of every seven bills has fecal bacteria on it. Here's something fun. Go down to the comments section and type the letter V. If you used a mobile phone to do that, congratulations. You just touched 6,281 bacteria. If you're using a desktop keyboard, you're a little safer. You probably only touched about 180. Cell phones are actually one of the most bacteria-ridden things we frequently encounter. If you want to estimate about how many bacteria are specifically on your phone, based on how clean you are, the oatmeal has a really great quiz. You can find that in the description. But honestly, what amazes me the most isn't how dirty our world is or how much bacteria there is. Instead, it's the fact that despite those numbers, we don't get sick more often. Our immune system is amazing. But it relies on the same principles of adhesion that bacteria do. The forces that cause food dropped on the floor to pick up germs are the same forces that we need to fight them. They're the same forces that bring us closer together, whether we like it or not. So keep adhering, and as always, thanks for watching.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1555\n","\n","Link  294 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/sHCHEykUxP4\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/sHCHEykUxP4\n","[youtube] sHCHEykUxP4: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] sHCHEykUxP4: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 14.87MiB in 04:52\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Hi, Vsauce Michael here. You can practice speaking backwards so when your words are reversed they're intelligible. But here's something else that is weird. The digits in the speed of light are exactly the same as the latitude of the Great Pyramid of Giza. And as the anagram genius has revealed, all the world's a stage, but if you rearrange the letters in the meaning of life, it becomes the engine of a film. Or more pessimistically, the fine game of Nell. What does all of this mean? Are these just coincidences? Or are greater powers at work? Why is it so easy for us to find hidden messages? Why can a mere coincidence give us chills? And why is it so fun? When you reverse Neil Armstrong saying, small step for man, you can hear what sounds like man will spacewalk. That's one small step for man, and I have a spacewalk. Lee Harvey Oswald assassinated President John F. Kennedy, and in this interview he defends the Fair Play for Cuba committee, of which he was a member. The fact that I did live for a time in the Soviet Union gives me excellent qualifications to repudiate charges that Cuba and the Fair Play for Cuba committee is communist controlled. Now listen to what it sounds like when we reverse him saying, and the Fair Play for Cuba. And the Fair Play for Cuba. Luis Reveal Persona. Luis Reveal Persona. Luis Reveal Persona. Is that a coincidence, or a subconscious confession hidden within his own words? It's a coincidence. For crying out loud if anybody says, and the Fair Play for Cuba. And then reverses it, it sounds the same. This app, by the way, is called Virtual Recorder. It's a really easy way to quickly reverse your own speech. Matthew Hudson in The Seven Laws of Magical Thinking points out that if you record yourself saying, ooh, you sniffed turkey fat, and then reverse it, it sounds a bit like Happy Birthday to You. Happy Birthday to You. Kind of. If a word can be spelled the same forward and backward, it's a palindrome. But if a word or phrase sounds the same, whether spoken forward or rewound, it is a phonetic palindrome. For example, say yes. Reversed? Say yes. Pretty cool. But check out this poem by Karsten Johansson. And I wonder why what's never been's never been so. We would lie when we say yes. You know we all love you. What's never been's never been so. Hell, we're nowhere now. Whanawonderwhanawasnivervansnivervansthoweaveallawyouwannweseyesimnwya. By the way, some people can speak in reverse on the fly. It is really cool. To see them in action, watch guys lean back after this video. It's linked down in the description and it's full of pretty cool coincidence videos. Apophenia is the perception of connections or patterns in information. One type of apophenia is pareidolia, the seeing or hearing of things that weren't meant to be there. For instance, hearing your name being called or your phone ringing in the sound of running water. Or hearing English words in a non-English song. Or seeing faces that weren't purposefully placed there. Our brains are good at this kind of work. Probably because being hyper attentive to patterns and faces can save your life. If there's ambiguity as to whether that thing hiding in the shadows is a threat or just a shadow, it's advantageous to err on the side of threat. Organisms with a healthy sense of apophenia live longer. Long enough to have kids and raise them and naturally become the norm. We connect with faces so well. Hudson relates a story of a friend who draws faces on things she doesn't want to lose, like her bags. She says the faces make her less likely to forget about them. If you like it, you should have put a ring on it. If you like not losing it, you should have drawn a face on it. We are so good at teasing out patterns and faces from random noise. Shuffle random sequences don't always feel random to us. Originally, Apple's iTunes shuffle feature generated complaints from users. They said that similar songs, or songs from the same artist, appeared in a string, which of course is to be expected from randomness, but it didn't feel random enough. So Apple introduced a smart shuffle that avoided totally random sequences that nonetheless didn't seem random to our pattern-loving brains. As Steve Jobs explained, we are making it less random to make it feel more random. Our impressive ability to imagine patterns also expresses itself when it comes to connecting songs and moving images. This dancing Spider-Man animation will famously sync up with any music you play. Try it. What kind of black magic is going on here? Well, as it turns out, most of it is in our heads. Radiolab reported that Michigan State University explains that the major movements of dancing animations like this one, or this one, move at typical song tempos, but also contain, like most dance, various other different related rhythms of movement, allowing them to seemingly fit many different tempos. Animation bias helps a lot, too. We fall prey to this when we reject all the times the animation doesn't really sync up, focusing instead on the more surprising times when it does. The bizarre pyramid coincidence mentioned earlier is a lot less bizarre when you consider the fact that we got to control where we placed the decimal point and that a number of degrees this precise isn't necessary to locate the pyramid. By the fourth decimal, we're only talking about a matter of a few meters, so it's easy to make the rest fit the speed of light exactly and have still picked a point on the pyramid. Confirmation bias also comes into play here. If you really want two things to sync up, they will. We often look for evidence that supports what we already believe while marginalizing things against it. As Marshall McLuhan said, I wouldn't have seen it if I hadn't believed it. These biases also help explain the seemingly mind-blowing coincidence that famous movies and famous albums can line up. One of the most popular states that if you start playing Pink Floyd's Dark Side of the Moon at the same time as The Wizard of Oz, they will eerily line up. Entire communities have sprouted around the syncing of movies and albums. Some of my favorites are the Yellow Submarine soundtrack and The Little Mermaid, Lorde's Pure Heroine and Twilight Saga Breaking Dawn 2, and the end of 2001 A Space Odyssey with Pink Floyd's Echoes. There are conspiracies that these were somehow secretly planned, though in reality they're just accidental music videos. The product of selection bias, confirmation bias, and the law of near enough, a behavior of our pattern-sensitive minds. Two things don't have to line up exactly or literally for us to see a connection. This is why vague predictions are a great way to look psychic. These are also actually unsurprising when you consider the fact that the number of narrative paces and rhythms we enjoy and typically use are much smaller than the number possible. In The Improbability Principle, David J. Hand calls this the probability lever. What may be rare on average or when considering all possible scenarios can be less rare for specific scenarios, even if they are only marginally different. Getting struck by lightning is a proverbially unlikely event, but Walter Summerford wasn't just struck by lightning once during his life. He was struck three times. It never killed him, but four years after his death, his gravestone was also struck by lightning. What are the chances? I mean, clearly, Summerford was some sort of robot built out of lightning rods or had somehow angered Zeus, right? Probably not. You see, while for the average person, the chance of being struck by lightning is quite low, for an avid outdoor sportsman like Summerford, it's not as low. The law of truly large numbers also comes into play here, with lightning striking Earth 40 to 50 times a second, billions of people for it to strike and thousands of years of recorded history, it's actually not surprising at all that at least once a story like Summerford's would have happened. Given the truly large number of people who visit Disney World every day and the fact that they take photos and lots of them, it's actually not surprising at all that at least once so far a story like Alex and Donna Vutzina's has happened. While sorting through old photos before their wedding, Alex and Donna found a photo of Donna at Disney World 14 years before the couple met. But then Alex noticed something. He too had visited Disney World as a child and there, in the background, was his father pushing him in a stroller. Sometimes coincidences can be tragic. In 1864, Abraham Lincoln's son, Robert Lincoln, was saved from serious injury or possibly even death when a stranger grabbed him by the shirt collar moments before he plunged onto train tracks below. That stranger turned out to be Edwin Booth, one of the most famous Shakespearean actors of the time. So famous, in fact, Robert recognized him and had a letter sent thanking him for saving his life. Less than a year later, Edwin Booth's brother, John Wilkes Booth, undid the favor by assassinating Abraham Lincoln. Such as they seem at first, math says that given enough time and psychology says that given enough interest in finding them, coincidences and connections will be found. Even unlikely ones. The coincidences between Abraham Lincoln and John F. Kennedy are famous. Both were elected to the presidency in a year ending with 60. Lincoln was shot at Ford's Theater. Kennedy was shot in a 1961 Lincoln Continental four-door convertible made by Ford. Both presidents' last names have seven letters and both assassins had 15 letters in their names. The list goes on, as it should. If you look long enough, you can find coincidences between any two people or things or events. They may seem strange at first but tend to wind up being, in the end, pretty expected. For just one example, name length isn't that wildly variable. Seven-letter names are pretty common. Lincoln, Kennedy, Michael, Stevens. In the famous Spooky Presidential Coincidences Contest held by the Skeptical Enquirer in 1992, one contestant alone found similar lists of crazy coincidences between 21 pairs of former presidents. Given the vast amount of details in any one of our lives, it's pretty easy. This quirk can be exploited to almost comedic heights when it comes to overanalyzing. Of course, hidden messages and signs are often intentionally included in media for fun or to reward attentive viewers. But unintentional, extraordinary things happen all the time. It's not really that extraordinary. There's a famous calculation that is known as Littlewood's Law. Given the number of hours we are awake every day and assuming an event only takes about a second to occur, if you calculate the odds of something happening to you are only one in a million, well, you should expect that thing to happen to you about once every 35 days. David J. Hand took this even further with seven billion people on Earth. The chance that an event with a one in a million probability of happening to each of us won't happen today is one in ten to the 3,040. As Percy Diaconis put it, the truly unusual day would be a day where nothing unusual happens. And as always, thanks for watching. You may have noticed a lot of YouTube channels making videos about learning this week. Well, that is not a coincidence. It is School of YouTube Week. Many people are going back to school or college right now, but across the world, millions of children won't be. Either because they work to support their families or live without a home or in areas where there is conflict. They may experience overcrowding at school or a lack of teaching and school supplies. But luckily, we can help. Donations to Comic Relief's School of YouTube campaign can help disadvantaged young people all around the world get an education. It doesn't take much to change a life. You can learn more in the description below or donate right now.

Michael here. If you threw every single human alive today into the Grand Canyon, we would not fill it up. We could make a pile about this big. That's it. That's all of us. All 7.159 billion of us in one place. A species portrait. It kinda puts humanity in perspective. And you. So does this. Every day you produce about one to two liters of spit, which means in your entire lifetime, all together, you will not produce enough spit to fill an Olympic-size swimming pool. So far, 560 billion Lego parts have been manufactured and the total number of grains of sand on Earth is estimated to be 7.5 times 10 to the 18th. But here's the thing. How many things are there? Total. Well, how do you define a thing? Well, let's say it's a thing if you can think about it or talk about it. If you can call it a thing, it's a thing. This is gonna be a lot of things. Things can be real, imaginary, impossible. Ideas are things. Things can be looked forward to and things can be in the past. Or yellow or concrete or abstract. Things can happen and some things probably won't. Making a video about how many things there are? Well, that's a thing that I'm doing right now. Let's count everything. Right away the answer seems obvious. The word thing is so vague, the answer is clearly infinite. Possibly. Not. All we have to do is take the maximum number of physical things, things out there in the real world beyond our minds we could in theory measure and add to that the total number of things we could imagine. The total number of thoughts possible. For the purposes of this video, let's assume that numbers and math and the laws of physics exist as part of the way our universe is. But the names and representations they've been given are the products of thinking minds and those things are, well, things that we can count. And there's no reason to double count. All of the indivisible pieces that make up me, particles or strings or whatever, are the same as the thing that has been named me. Abraham Lincoln has a great quote about this. How many legs does a sheep have if you call its tail a leg? Four. Because calling a tail a leg doesn't make it one. Okay, let's begin. When counting the number of physical things in the universe we hit an unknown. How big is the universe? The entire universe could be infinite or it could be finite but edgeless for a variety of reasons. There could also be other universes. But it's unclear whether we'll ever be able to actually see all these things. Instead, what we are stuck with and what we usually mean when we say the universe is the observable universe whose future visibility limit has been estimated to be only 62 billion light years in any direction. That's it. This is likely the only inventoriable space we'll ever need to worry about. And it contains roughly, on average, 10 to the 80 elementary particles. Particles with no further internal parts as far as we currently know. So that's our answer, right? There are 10 to the 80 physical things that exist out there beyond our minds. Any other physical thing, water, dogs, planets, saxophones are just names given to particular arrangements of those same 10 to the 80 particles. But wait, what if in the future we discover that what we call elementary particles today are actually just made out of smaller things we should have counted instead? Well, to cover ourselves, let's count the maximum possible number of the smallest measurable thing, something the size of a Planck volume. 10 to the power of 183 things that small could fit within our observable universe. I like this number. 10 to the power of 183. You couldn't easily argue there were more things than that in the physical real world. But you could imagine. A Planck length, a Planck volume, that's just the smallest measurable amount of space, not the smallest possible. You could imagine a half Planck volume, a 10,000th of a Planck volume, but that would just be a thought and only ever a thought. So, how many possible thoughts are there? It's probably safe to say that the number of possible thoughts is indeed infinite. For example, numbers. You can't say there's a limit to the biggest number we can imagine. But, unlike physical things that exist whether or not we have discovered them, do unthought thoughts already exist? Hmm... It seems more like the pool of possible thoughts is really just one thing and actual elements from that set don't become things by themselves until we thing them. That is, we or some other mind thinks about them or talks about them. And there's a limit to how many things we or anything else could ever thing. Our observable universe is only so big and it will contain usable energy for only so long. After about 1 trillion to 100 trillion years, the supply of gas needed to form new stars will be exhausted and the lights will start going out one star at a time. After a Google years, the amount of usable energy left in the universe will be zero and nothing will be able to happen. To calculate the maximum number of thoughts that could be thought inside our observable universe, let's take all of its mass and turn it into human brains that just think new and random thoughts from the beginning of time until the universe runs out of usable energy, a Google years of thinking. But wait, what if there are alien brains or, for all we know, Earthling brains that think faster than we can? Okay, well to be safe, let's not turn all of that mass into human brains. Let's use it to build a giant hypothetical machine that computes at the fastest speed possible given the speed of light and the uncertainty principle, Bremerman's Limit. It's 1.36 times 10 to the 50 bits per second per kilogram of material. Now, a high-end estimate for the total mass of the observable universe is 3.4 times 10 to the 60 kilograms, which, used exclusively for the best possible computing machine, could altogether process 4.624 times 10 to the 110 bits per second. Now, with 3.154 times 10 to the 116 seconds available from the beginning of time to the heat death of the universe and an assumption that the average thought takes about a sentence worth of information to describe, say, about 800 bits, we get a total of 1.458 times 10 to the 227 things that could ever be thought or imagined. That number is huge in the observable universe. The universe as we will ever know it, the number of thoughts that can be thought is so much larger than the number of physical things there can be without imagination. And if you were to combine the two totals, the number of physical things would barely make a difference. So, funny enough, when it comes to every thing in the universe, it really is the thought that counts. And as always, thanks for watching.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1223\n","\n","Link  296 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/thfz0BBXF2U\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/thfz0BBXF2U\n","[youtube] thfz0BBXF2U: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] thfz0BBXF2U: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 4.66MiB in 01:11\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  So you're a curious lover of science. What do you think of the efforts that Elon Musk is doing with space exploration, with electric vehicles, with autopilot, sort of getting into the space of autonomous vehicles, with boring under LA, and Neuralink trying to communicate brain machine interfaces, communicate between machines and human brains? Well, it's really inspiring. I mean, look at the fandom that he's amassed. It's not common for someone like that to have such a following. And so it's- Engineering nerd. Yeah, so it's really exciting, but I also think that a lot of responsibility comes with that kind of power. So like if I met him, I would love to hear how he feels about the responsibility he has when there are people who are such a fan of your ideas and your dreams and share them so closely with you. You have a lot of power and he didn't always have that. He wasn't born as Elon Musk. Well, he was, but well, he was named that later. But the point is that I wanna know the psychology of becoming a figure like him. Well, I don't even know how to phrase the question right, but it's a question about what do you do when you're following, your fans become so large that it's almost bigger than you. And how do you responsibly manage that? And maybe it doesn't worry him at all, and that's fine too. But I'd be really curious. And I think there are a lot of people that go through this when they realize, whoa, there are a lot of eyes on me. There are a lot of people who really take what I say very earnestly and take it to heart and will defend me. And that can be dangerous and you have to be responsible with it. Both in terms of impact on society and psychologically for the individual, just the burden psychologically on Elon. Yeah, yeah, how does he think about that? Part of his persona. Well, let me throw that right back at you because in some ways you're just a funny guy that got in a humongous following, a funny guy with a curiosity, got a huge following. How do you psychologically deal with the responsibility? In many ways you have a reach in many ways bigger than Elon Musk. What is the burden that you feel in educating, being one of the biggest educators in the world where everybody's listening to you and actually everybody, like most of the world that uses YouTube for educational material, trust you as a source of good, strong scientific thinking? It's a burden and I try to approach it with a lot of humility and sharing. I'm not out there doing a lot of scientific experiments. I am sharing the work of real scientists and I'm celebrating their work and the way that they think and the power of curiosity. But I wanna make it clear at all times that like, look, we don't know all the answers and I don't think we're ever going to reach a point where we're like, wow, and there you go. That's the universe. It's this equation, you plug in some conditions or whatever and you do the math and you know what's gonna happen tomorrow. I don't think we're ever gonna reach that point, but I think that there is a tendency to sometimes believe in science and become elitist and become, I don't know, hard when in reality, it should humble you and make you feel smaller. I think there's something very beautiful about feeling very, very small and very weak and to feel that you need other people. So I try to keep that in mind and say, look, thanks for watching. Vsauce is not, I'm not Vsauce, you are. When I start the episodes, I say, hey, Vsauce, Michael here. Vsauce and Michael are actually a different thing in my mind. I don't know if that's always clear, but yeah, I have to approach it that way because it's not about me. Yeah, so it's not even, you're not feeling responsibility. You're just sort of plugging into this big thing that is scientific exploration of our reality and you're a voice that represents a bunch, but you're just plugging into this big Vsauce ball that others, millions of others are plugged into. Yeah, and I'm just hoping to encourage curiosity and responsible thinking and an embracement of doubt and being okay with that.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 754\n","\n","Link  297 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/7uiv6tKtoKg\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/7uiv6tKtoKg\n","[youtube] 7uiv6tKtoKg: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 7uiv6tKtoKg: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 9.08MiB in 03:31\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. And the year 6009 will be the very first year since 1961 that a year when written in Hindu-Arabic numerals can be inverted and still look the same. But you and I probably won't live long enough to enjoy the year 6009. Human lives just aren't long enough. We will miss out on that. What other cool future events will we be missing? Well, first of all, you and I will probably be gone before the completion of the Time Pyramid in Wembingen, Germany. It will eventually be a pile of 120 concrete blocks, but the builders are only adding one block every 10 years. Since beginning in 1993, they've added only the first three. At this rate, the pyramid will be completed in the year 3183, the final block placed by our great-great-great-great-great-great-more-than-thirty-greats grandchildren. But even they will miss an opportunity to frolic and play safely in the Chernobyl exclusion zone, the Zone of Alienation, where radioactive contamination from the 1986 disaster will remain at levels too high for safe human activity until not the year 4000, not the 5000s, not the 6000s. It will finally be safe probably in the year 22,000. Possibly within our lifetimes, but definitely within the next one million years, stars like Beetlejuice and Eta Carina will explode in brilliant supernovas visible from Earth. I'm bummed I'm probably going to miss out on these events because for a few weeks it will look almost as if Earth has two suns. Despite being hundreds, thousands of light-years away, their supernovas will shine brighter than the full moon at night and be visible even during daytime. But the real sky show comes in 3.75 billion years. Our galaxy is full of stars. Viewed from the surface of the Earth, they look like little drops of milk in the sky, which is why we call it the Milky Way Galaxy. But all galaxies are named after milk. Milk. Lactose. Lactic. Galactic. Galaxies. And every drop of milk in the sky, every star that you can see is inside our galaxy, the Milky Way. But there's a blurry distant shape. This one. It's not a star. It's not a cloud of gas in our galaxy. It is an entirely different galaxy. The Andromeda Galaxy and it's two and a half million light-years away from our own. It contains twice as many stars as the Milky Way and it is coming our way. Headed toward us at 300 kilometers a second, faster than a bullet. Now right now the sky looks like this. In two billion years, Andromeda will have approached so closely that people will look up at the sky and see this. In 3.75 billion years, the night sky will be like a scene from a science fiction movie or an awesome desktop wallpaper. Incredible. And kind of scary. After this scene, the sky will literally be glowing with the birth of new stars as the Milky Way and Andromeda collide, mixing up into a brilliant cosmic tie-dye. This simulation shows how Andromeda might collide with the Milky Way, but keep in mind that you are watching billions of years past every second. These galaxies are moving fast, but they're also huge and covering even huger distances. They will collide in the future. But within the briefness of a single human life, they appear almost frozen, unmoving. A couple billion years after colliding, the cores of both galaxies will be married together in a bright glowing center. Earth, now a stepchild to what was once Andromeda, part of a new, bigger family called Milkdromeda. It would be so cool to be alive to see our galaxy colliding with another. But don't get all FOMO, consumed by a fear of missing out. Because whatever life is around then will have plenty to envy us for. They may have spectacular nightly views, but secretly wish they'd been born in our time to experience, say, the beginning of the internet. They will actually miss out on a lot of things. Because the moon moves one centimeter further away from Earth every year, 600 million years from today, the moon will no longer be close enough to Earth to completely block out the Sun. Future humans or descendants of humans will therefore miss out on a chance to ever see for themselves the beauty of a total solar eclipse from the surface of Earth. Long before Earth dries up, Niagara Falls will dry up. Well, not the water part, but the falls part. Every year, the rushing water of Niagara erodes the rock at the top of the falls one foot backward. By the year 52,000, it will have eroded all the way to Lake Erie and our progeny will have no Niagara Falls to enjoy. Granite has an erosion rate of about one inch per 10,000 years. So certainly by the year 7 million, Mount Rushmore, especially its faces, will no longer exist. And because they slowly get pulled in or ejected into space in 50 to 100 million years, Saturn will no longer have its lovely rings. So life on Earth in the future might have awesome supernovas and galactic collisions to look forward to, but they probably won't have Niagara Falls, Mount Rushmore, total solar eclipses or Saturn's rings. They also won't have you. But you have you. Except not all of it. Babies don't begin to form episodic memories right away, meaning that you missed out on, you don't remember two of the most seminal events in your life, your conception and your birth. But you can experience a bit of those moments right now. First of all, WhenWasIConceived.com lets you enter your birthdate and get back the week your parents probably made you happen, as well as the number one song in the number one movie of that week, which may have also been involved. Light travels quickly, the most quickest in fact, but it can take a photon millions of years to escape from the interior of the star it was created in through nuclear fusion. It takes time, just like your own gestation in your mother's womb. Newly conceived photons struggle through a dense, stellar jungle of atoms and molecules and electrons that absorb and re-emit the photon, taking a little bit of energy from it as it randomly rolls around like a pinball. Sometimes after thousands or millions of years, its random walk finally leads it to the star's surface where it pops out into space, in a way, is born. A lucky tiny, tiny, tiny percentage of the photons that reach the surface of a star find themselves on a path that will intersect with Earth. And if you are lucky, those photons will end their journey by being absorbed onto your own retina. If you enter the date of your birth, or the approximate date of your conception, into this online calculator, you can find a star that is as many light years away from Earth as you are old. When you look up at that star today, you are seeing light that left the star the very month you were born, or photons that left that star and entered space when your entire body was just one cell. Space is really big and your life is very short, but space is so gosh darn big, you don't have to miss out on everything. And as always, thanks for watching.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1243\n","\n","Link  298 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/s86-Z-CbaHA\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/s86-Z-CbaHA\n","[youtube] s86-Z-CbaHA: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] s86-Z-CbaHA: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 23.15MiB in 05:50\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Hey, Vsauce. Michael here. There's a famous way to seemingly create chocolate out of nothing. Maybe you've seen it before. This chocolate bar is four squares by eight squares. But if you cut it like this and then like this and finally like this, you can rearrange the pieces like so and wind up with the same four by eight bar, but with a leftover piece apparently created out of thin air. There's a popular animation of this illusion as well. I call it an illusion because it's just that. Fake. In reality, the final bar is a bit smaller. It contains this much less chocolate. Each square along the cut is shorter than it was in the original, but the cut makes it difficult to notice right away. The animation is extra misleading because it tries to cover up its deception. The lost height of each square is surreptitiously added in while the piece moves to make it hard to notice. I mean, come on. Obviously, you cannot cut up a chocolate bar and rearrange the pieces into more than you started with. Or can you? One of the strangest theorems in modern mathematics is the Banach-Tarski paradox. It proves that there is in fact a way to take an object and separate it into five different pieces. And then, with those five pieces, simply rearrange them, no stretching required, into two exact copies of the original item. Same density, same size, same everything. Seriously, to dive into the mind blow that it is and the way it fundamentally questions math and ourselves, we have to start by asking a few questions. First, what is infinity? A number? I mean, it's nowhere on the number line, but we often say things like, there's an infinite number of blah blah blah. And as far as we know, infinity could be real. The universe may be infinite in size and flat, extending out forever and ever without end, beyond even the part we can observe or ever hope to observe. That's exactly what infinity is. Not a number per se, but rather a size. The size of something that doesn't end. Infinity is not the biggest number. Instead, it is how many numbers there are. But there are different sizes of infinity. The smallest type of infinity is countable infinity, the number of hours in forever. It's also the number of whole numbers that there are, natural numbers, the numbers we use when counting things, like 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and so on. Sets like these are unending, but they are countable. Countable means that you can count them from one element to any other in a finite amount of time. Even if that finite amount of time is longer than you will live or the universe will exist for, it's still finite. Uncountable infinity, on the other hand, is literally bigger. Too big to even count. The number of real numbers that there are, not just whole numbers, but all numbers, is uncountably infinite. You literally cannot count even from 0 to 1 in a finite amount of time by naming every real number in between. I mean, where do you even start? 0, okay, but what comes next? 0.000000... Eventually, we would imagine a 1 going somewhere at the end, but there is no end. We could always add another 0. Uncountability makes this set so much larger than the set of all whole numbers that even between 0 and 1, there are more numbers than there are whole numbers on the entire endless number line. Deder Cantor's famous diagonal argument helps illustrate this. Imagine listing every number between 0 and 1. Since they are uncountable and can't be listed in order, let's imagine randomly generating them forever with no repeats. Each number we generate can be paired with a whole number. If there's a one-to-one correspondence between the two, that is, if we can match one whole number to each real number on our list, that would mean that countable and uncountable sets are the same size. But we can't do that. Even though this list goes on forever, forever isn't enough. Watch this. If we go diagonally down our endless list of real numbers and take the first decimal of the first number and the second of the second number, the third of the third, and so on, and add one to each, subtracting one, if it happens to be a nine, we can generate a new real number that is obviously between 0 and 1, but since we've defined it to be different from every number on our endless list in at least one place, it's clearly not contained in the list. In other words, we've used up every single whole number, the entire infinity of them, and yet we can still come up with more real numbers. Here's something else that is true but counterintuitive. There are the same number of even numbers as there are even and odd numbers. At first, that sounds ridiculous. Clearly there are only half as many even numbers as all whole numbers, but that intuition is wrong. The set of all whole numbers is denser, but every even number can be matched with a whole number. You will never run out of members of either set, so this one-to-one correspondence shows that both sets are the same size. In other words, infinity divided by 2 is still infinity. Infinity plus 1 is also infinity. A good illustration of this is Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel. Imagine a hotel with a countably infinite number of rooms, but now imagine that there is a person booked into every single room. Seemingly, it's fully booked, right? No. Infinite sets go against common sense. You see, if a new guest shows up and wants a room, all the hotel has to do is move the guest in room number 1 to room number 2, and the guest in room 2 to room 3 and 3 to 4 and 4 to 5 and so on. Because the number of rooms is never-ending, we cannot run out of rooms. Infinity minus 1 is also infinity again. If one guest leaves the hotel, we can shift every guest the other way. Guest 2 goes to room 1, 3 to 2, 4 to 3, and so on, because we have an infinite amount of guests that is a never-ending supply of them, no room will be left empty. As it turns out, you can subtract any finite number from infinity and still be left with infinity. It doesn't care. It's unending. Banach Tarski hasn't left our sights yet. All of this is related. We are now ready to move on to shapes. Hilbert's hotel can be applied to a circle. Points around the circumference can be thought of as guests. If we remove one point from the circle, that point is gone, right? Infinity tells us it doesn't matter. The circumference of a circle is irrational. It's the radius times 2 pi. So, if we mark off points beginning from the whole, every radius length along the circumference going clockwise, we will never land on the same point twice. Ever. We can count off each point we mark with a whole number. So, this set is never-ending, but countable, just like guests in rooms in Hilbert's hotel. And like those guests, even though one has checked out, we can just shift the rest, move them counter-clockwise, and every room will be filled. Point 1 moves to fill in the whole, point 2 fills in the place where point 1 used to be, 3 fills in 2, and so on. Since we have an unending supply of numbered points, no whole will be left unfilled. The missing point is forgotten. We apparently never needed it to be complete. There's one last meadow consequence of infinity we should discuss before tackling Banach-Tarski. Ian Stewart famously proposed a brilliant dictionary, one that he called the Hyper-Webster. The Hyper-Webster lists every single possible word of any length formed from the 26 letters in the English alphabet. It begins with A, followed by AA, then AAA, then AAAA, and after an infinite number of those, AB, then ABA, then ABAA, ABAAA, and so on until Z, ZA, ZAA, etc., etc., until the final entry, an infinite sequence of Zs. Such a dictionary would contain every single word. Nay, every single thought, definition, description, truth, lie, name, story, what happened to Amelia Earhart would be in that dictionary as well as every single thing that didn't happen to Amelia Earhart. Everything that could be said using our alphabet. Obviously, it would be huge, but the company publishing it might realize that they could take a shortcut. If they put all the words that begin with A in a volume titled A, they wouldn't have to print the initial A. Readers would know to just add the A because it's the A volume. By removing the initial A, the publisher is left with every A word sans the first A, which has surprisingly become every possible word. Just one of the 26 volumes has been decomposed into the entire thing. It is now that we're ready to investigate this video's titular paradox. What if we turned an object, a 3D thing, into a hyper-webster? Could we decompose pieces of it into the whole thing? Yes. The first thing we need to do is give every single point on the surface of the sphere one name and one name only. A good way to do this is to name them after how they can be reached by a given starting point. If we move this starting point across the surface of the sphere in steps that are just the right length, no matter how many times or in what direction we rotate, so long as we never backtrack, it will never wind up in the same place twice. We only need to rotate in four directions to achieve this paradox. Up, down, left and right, around two perpendicular axes. We are going to need every single possible sequence that can be made of any finite length out of just these four rotations. That means we will need left, right, up and down, as well as left-left, left-up, left-down, but of course not left-right because, well, that's backtracking. Going left and then right means you're the same as you were before you did anything. So no left-rights, no right-lefts and no up-downs and no down-ups. Also, notice that I'm writing the rotations in order right to left, so the final rotation is the leftmost letter. That will be important later on. Anyway, a list of all possible sequences of allowed rotations that are finite in length is, well, huge. Countably infinite, in fact. But if we apply each one of them to a starting point in green here and then name the point we land on after the sequence that brought us there, we can name a countably infinite set of points on the surface. Let's look at how, say, these four strings on our list would work. Right, up, left. Okay, rotating the starting point this way takes us here. Let's color code the point based on the final rotation in its string. In this case, it's left and for that we will use purple. Next up, down-down. That sequence takes us here. We name the point DD and color it blue since we ended with a down rotation. RDR, that will be this point's name, takes us here and for a final right rotation, let's use red. Finally, for a sequence that ends with up, let's color code the point orange. Now, if we imagine completing this process for every single sequence, we will have a countably infinite number of points named and color coded. That's great, but not enough. There are an uncountably infinite number of points on a sphere's surface. But no worries, we can just pick a point we missed, any point, and color it green, making it a new starting point and then run every sequence from here. After doing this, to an uncountably infinite number of starting points, we will have indeed named and colored every single point on the surface just once. With the exception of poles. Every sequence has two poles of rotation, locations on the sphere that come back to exactly where they started. For any sequence of right or left rotations, the poles are the north and south poles. The problem with poles like these is that more than one sequence can lead us to them. They can be named more than once and be colored in more than one color. For example, if you follow some other sequence to the north or south pole, any subsequent rights or lefts will be equally valid names. In order to deal with this, we're going to just count them out of the normal scheme and color them all yellow. Every sequence has two, so there are a countably infinite amount of them. Now, with every point on the sphere given just one name and just one of six colors, we are ready to take the entire sphere apart. Every point on the surface corresponds to a unique line of points below it all the way to the center point and we will be dragging every points line along with it. The lone center point we will set aside. Okay, first we cut out and extract all the yellow poles. The green starting points, the orange up points, the blue down points and the red and purple left and right points. That's the entire sphere. With just these pieces, you could build the whole thing. But take a look at the left piece. It is defined by being a piece composed of every point accessed via a sequence ending with a left rotation. If we rotate this piece right, that's the same as adding an R to every point's name. But left and then right is a backtrack. They cancel each other out. And look what happens when we reduce them away. The set becomes the same as a set of all points with names that end with L, but also U, D and every point reached with no rotation. That's the full set of starting points. We have turned less than a quarter of the sphere into nearly three quarters just by rotating it. We added nothing. It's like the hyper webster. If we add the right piece and the poles of rotation in the center point, well, we've got the entire sphere again, but with stuff left over. To make a second copy, let's rotate the up piece down. The down-ups cancel because, well, it's the same as going nowhere and we're left with a set of all starting points, the entire up piece, the right piece and the left piece. But there's a problem here. We don't need this extra set of starting points. We still haven't used the original ones. No worries. Let's just start over. We can just move everything from the up piece that turns into a starting point when rotated down. That means every point whose final rotation is up. Let's put them in the down piece. Of course, after rotating, points named U, U will just turn into points named U. And that would give us a copy here and here. So, as it turns out, we need to move all points with any name that is just a string of U's. We will put them in the down piece and rotate the up piece down, which makes it congruent to the up, right and left pieces, add in the down piece along with some up and the starting point piece and, well, we're almost done. The poles of rotation and center are missing from this copy, but no worries. There's a countably infinite number of holes where the poles of rotation used to be, which means there is some pole around which we can rotate this sphere such that every pole hole orbits around without hitting another. Well, this is just a bunch of circles with one point missing. We fill them each like we did earlier and we do the same for the center point. Imagine a circle that contains it inside the sphere and just fill in from infinity. And look what we've done. We have taken one sphere and turned it into two identical spheres without adding anything. One plus one equals one. That took a while to go through, but the implications are huge and mathematicians, scientists and philosophers are still debating them. Could such a process happen in the real world? I mean, it can happen mathematically and math allows us to abstractly predict and describe a lot of things in the real world with amazing accuracy. But does the Banach-Tarski paradox take it too far? Is it a place where math and physics separate? We still don't know. History is full of examples of mathematical concepts developed in the abstract that we did not think would ever apply to the real world for years, decades, centuries until eventually science caught up and realized they were totally applicable and useful. The Banach-Tarski paradox could actually happen in our real world. The only catch of course is that the five pieces you cut your object into aren't simple shapes. They must be infinitely complex and detailed. That's not possible to do in the real world where measurements can only get so small and there's only a finite amount of time to do anything, but math says it's theoretically valid and some scientists think it may be physically valid too. There have been a number of papers published suggesting a link between Banach-Tarski and the way tiny, tiny subatomic particles can collide at high energies and turn into more particles than we began with. We are finite creatures. Our lives are small and can only scientifically consider a small part of reality. What's common for us is just a sliver of what's available. We can only see so much of the electromagnetic spectrum. We can only delve so deep into extensions of space. Common sense applies to that which we can access, but common sense is just that. Common. If total sense is what we want, we should be prepared to accept that we shouldn't call infinity weird or strange. The results we've arrived at by accepting it are valid. True within the system we use to understand, measure, predict and order the universe. Perhaps the system still needs perfecting, but at the end of the day history continues to show us that the universe isn't strange. We are. And as always, thanks for watching. Finally, as always, the description is full of links to learn more. There are also a number of books linked down there that really helped me wrap my mind, kind of, around Bonnock Tarski. First of all, Leonard Wapner's The P and the Sun. This book is fantastic and it's full of a lot of the preliminaries needed to understand the proof that comes later. He also talks a lot about the ramifications of what Bonnock Tarski and their theorem might mean for mathematics. Also, if you want to talk about math and whether it's discovered or invented, whether it really truly will map onto the universe, Yanovski's The Outer Limits of Reason is great. This is the favorite book of mine that I've read this entire year. Another good one is E. Brian Davies, Why Beliefs Matter. This is actually Corrin's favorite book, as you might be able to see there. It's delicious and full of lots of great information about the limits of what we can know and what science is and what mathematics is. If you love infinity and math, I cannot more highly recommend Matt Parker's Things to Make and Do in the Fourth Dimension. He is hilarious and this book is very, very great at explaining some pretty awesome things. So keep reading and if you're looking for something to watch, I hope you've already watched Kevin Lieber's film on Field Day. I already did a documentary about Whittier, Alaska over there. Kevin's got a great short film about putting things out on the internet and having people react to them. There's a rumor that Jake Roper might be doing something on Field Day soon, so check out mine, check out Kevin's and subscribe to Field Day for upcoming Jake Roper action, yeah? He's actually in this room right now, say hi Jake. Hi. Thanks for filming this by the way. You're welcome.

Michael here. Action and danger is exciting, but this is a fake gun and the process of enlarging a hole like the barrel of a gun is called boring. Boring. Boring a hole is a slow process requiring repetitive movements from a tool that goes in circles, which may be why things that are slow and repetitive and don't appear to be going anywhere came to be described with the same word. They're boring. But why do we get bored and why does it matter? Evidence of being temporarily uninterested in anything happening, boredom, has been found as far back as ancient Pompeii. Boredom is a feeling we don't like. It's uncomfortable, but it's trivial, right? I mean boredom happens to all of us, but now we have Facebook and Twitter and YouTube and texting and Candy Crush to keep ourselves occupied. So really, who cares? Well, here's the thing. Physical pain, heartbreak and nausea are also uncomfortable, but they're caused by dangerous, serious, toxic things. Whereas boredom occurs when you are merely uninterested in the outside world and the inner world of your thoughts, when you are alone with just yourself. So does the existence of boredom mean that when it really comes down to it, life itself existing isn't really enough? Arthur Schopenhauer said that if life possessed in itself a positive value and real content, there would be no such thing as boredom. Mere existence would fulfill and satisfy us. But apparently it doesn't because boredom exists. Is something wrong with being? Or is something awesome about us? Nearly 200 years ago, Giacomo Leopardi wrote in a letter to his father, boredom is the most sublime of all human emotions because it expresses the fact that the human spirit, in a certain sense, is greater than the entire universe. Boredom is an expression of a profound despair at not finding anything that can satisfy the soul's boundless needs. So while superficially boredom might seem trivial or childish, embarrassing, almost rude to admit to feeling, one thing's for sure, boredom isn't boring. When bored, your brain activity only drops about 5% and magnetic resonance images of people's brains while they were bored actually showed greater activity in regions responsible for recalling autobiographical memory, conceiving the thoughts and feelings of others, and conjuring hypothetical events. Imagining. Jennifer Schussler wrote about this in her appropriately titled essay, Our Boredom, Ourselves. She points out that in line with neurological evidence boredom historically has been an important source of creativity, well-being, and our very sense of self. It's an imposed state that leaves us to think about ourselves, notice things we may have overlooked and get antsy enough to take productive actions we might have otherwise put off like cleaning, writing, or challenging the mind with puzzles and games. As a pressure to move, boredom may have driven us to accomplish much of what we have achieved. But how do you measure boredom? The boredom proneness scale, BPS, assesses an individual's propensity for getting bored, in a sense their ease of being attentive. Average scores range between 81 and 117. We can take scores on the BPS and correlate them with other things. For instance, people who know themselves well can easily label their feelings, have high levels of self-awareness, tend to have lower propensities for feeling bored. But when it comes to feeling boredom frequently, the culprit may be one's own physiology. Individuals with fewer dopamine receptors in the brain tend to need more excitement to stay stimulated, meaning chronic boredom may be a symptom of the way your body is. A symptom that if left unchecked can become something worse. Antigostline lists depression, anxiety, drug addiction, alcoholism, hostility, poor social skills, bad grades and low work performance. In fact, the National Center on Drug Abuse and Addiction has reported that the top three risk factors for teenage substance abuse are too much stress, too much spending money and too much boredom. The Beth Israel Medical Center in New York reports that addicts reported levels of boredom are the only reliable indicator of whether or not they will stay clean. Our brains need stimulation in order to be healthy. Not so much that they're overwhelmed, but a perfect balance unique to each individual under which they can perform optimally with energized focus, what psychologists call flow. Too little stimulation and our brains will act out hoping to find some somewhere to prevent something worse from happening. Our brains have theosophobia, the fear of boredom. Peter Tuhi's Boredom, a lively history, quotes Norman Deuge's findings that nothing speeds brain atrophy more than being immobilized in the same environment. The monotony undermines our dopamine and attentional systems crucial for maintaining brain plasticity. Variety and stimulation encourage neurogenesis, new brain cells, and can extend the lives of cells that already exist in certain regions of the brain. In order to avoid a lack of stimulation, our brains will even try to make up their own stimulations. Hallucinations. Hallucinations can be induced in almost anyone's brain if there isn't enough stimulation around. For instance, the Gansfeld effect. When exposed to random noise and an unchanging monochromatic field, the brain freaks out and starts generating hallucinations. The effect can also be induced with ping pong ball hemispheres over the eyes and a radio tuned to static. Extended sensory deprivation in a special chamber that eliminates sight, sound, smell, taste, and tactile sensations by floating the body in a special fluid to reduce the sensation of weight can also cause hallucinations as well as anxiety. When denied proper stimulation, the brain goes through phases that begin with boredom and if left unchecked, can become worse. It's a phenomenon well documented in animals confined to cages for long periods of time. And in a horrific case, a human child named Jeannie. Born in 1957 in Arcadia, California, Jeannie became one of the most famous cases of abnormal child psychology. Her father was abusive to her and her family and delusional. He hated the outside world and sought to isolate his family from it as best he could. He confined Jeannie to a room with only two blacked out windows for the first 13 years of her life. He often tied her to a toilet chair and never fed her solid food. When authorities finally found her in 1970, she had not acquired a language and had the mental age of an 18-month-old child. Jeannie was extensively studied and became a staple of psychology courses, a rare example of an impossible experiment. What if a human child was isolated from human contact, social behaviors and human language? A feral child not raised by the proverbial wolves but instead right in the middle of suburbia. Jeannie is still alive today, her identity anonymous, as a ward of the state of California. Extended understimulation isn't just a punishment inflicted by delusional caretakers, it's also a punishment inflicted on criminals, especially in the form of solitary confinement. In the Bureau of Prisons, the record for most time spent denied social contact is held and still being set by Thomas Silverstein. Considered extremely dangerous, Silverstein has been kept in solitude since 1983. He has barely seen a single other human for the last 29 years. Stories like those are intense and are far beyond everyday occasional boredom. Simple boredom, what you feel when waiting at an airport or listening to an unengaging lecture, is not a disorder, it's not a mood, it's an emotion. Robert Plutchick's Wheel of Emotions is a great way to visualize this. The wheel is based on eight basic emotions extended in order of intensity. Boredom is positioned as a light version of disgust. Emotions are not superfluous. Normal amounts of them have a purpose. Creatures who feel emotions are often compelled to do and not do more complicated things than merely eating, drinking, sleeping and procreating, like building friendships, apologizing, loving unconditionally and planning, building for the future. Disgust is an emotion we don't like, it keeps us from doing things. Its purpose is most likely a warning, an alarm triggered by things that appear rancid, spoiled or toxic that could poison us or make us sick. Like a good friend, disgust pushes us away from such things, it guides us in a healthy direction. Likewise, boredom protects us. Monotonous speakers, mind-numbing tasks and overload of sameness, those things aren't dirty or poisonous, they're just not stimulating enough. Boredom compels us to new things, fresh stimulation and when it can be overcome, a propensity to boredom is a sign of a healthy mind. It's advantageous. Creatures who felt it wound up doing more, flourished more, which led to more creatures like themselves. Boredness-feelers. So the next time you're a little bored, be proud. Thank your ancestors, you are participating in a life-improving drive like hunger or thirst that pushes us toward new and better things. Give yourself time away from the usual distractions to get bored. It will be boring. But boring is literally how holes get made and perfected. Not all holes are useful but some become peepholes to some pretty cool stuff. And as always, thanks for watching.

The top 20 most common English words in order are are the of and to, a-in is I, that it for you was with on, as have but be they. That's a fun fact, a piece of trivia, but it's also more. You see, whether the most commonly used words are ranked across an entire language or in just one book or article, almost every time a bizarre pattern emerges, the second most used word will appear about half as often as the most used. The third one-third as often, the fourth one-fourth as often, the fifth one-fifth as often, the sixth one-sixth as often, and so on, all the way down. Seriously, for some reason the amount of times a word is used is just proportional to one over its rank. Word frequency and ranking on a log-log graph follow a nice straight line, a power law. This phenomenon is called Ziff's Law, and it doesn't only apply to English, it also applies to other languages like, well, all of them, even ancient languages we haven't been able to translate yet. And here's the thing, we have no idea why. It's surprising that something as complex as reality should be conveyed by something as creative as language in such a predictable way. How predictable? Well, watch this. According to wordcount.org, which ranks words as found in the British National Corpus, sauce is the 5,555th most common English word. Now, here is a list of how many times every word on Wikipedia and in the entire Gutenberg Corpus of tens of thousands of public domain books shows up. The most used word, the, shows up about 181 million times. Knowing these two things, we can estimate that the word sauce should appear about 30,000 times on Wikipedia and Gutenberg combined. And it pretty much does. What gives? The world is chaotic. Things are distributed in myriads of ways, not just power laws, and language is personal, intentional, idiosyncratic. What about the world and ourselves could cause such complex activities and behaviors to follow such a basic rule? We literally don't know. More than a century of research has yet to close the case. Moreover, Zipf's law doesn't just mysteriously describe word use. It's also found in city populations. Solar flare intensities, protein sequences and immune receptors, the amount of traffic websites get, earthquake magnitudes, the number of times academic papers are cited, last names, the firing patterns of neural networks, ingredients used in cookbooks, the number of phone calls people receive, the diameter of moon craters, the number of people that die in wars, the popularity of opening chess moves, even the rate at which we forget. There are plenty of theories about why language is Zipf-y, but no firm conclusions. And this video doesn't contain a definite explanation either. Sorry, I know that's a bummer since we appear to like knowing more than mystery. But that said, we also ask more than we answer. So let's dive into Zipf's ramifications, some related patterns, some possible explanations and the depth of the mystery itself. Zipf's law was popularized by George Zipf, a linguist at Harvard University. It is a discrete form of the continuous Pareto distribution from which we get the Pareto principle. Because so many real-world processes behave this way, the Pareto principle tells us that, as a rule of thumb, it's worth assuming that 20% of the causes are responsible for 80% of the outcome. Like in language, where the most frequently used 18% of words account for over 80% of word occurrences. In 1896, Vilfredo Pareto showed that approximately 80% of the land in Italy was owned by just 20% of the population. It is said that he later noticed in his garden, 20% of his pea pods contained 80% of the peas. He and other researchers looked at other data sets and found that this 80-20 imbalance comes up a lot in the world. The richest 20% of humans have 82.7% of the world's income. In the US, 20% of patients use 80% of health care resources. In 2002, Microsoft reported that 80% of the errors and crashes in Windows and Office are caused by 20% of the bugs detected. A common rule of thumb in the business world states that 20% of your customers are responsible for 80% of your profits and 80% of the complaints you receive will come from 20% of your customers. A book titled The 80-20 Principle even says that in a home or office, 20% of the carpet receives 80% of the wear. Oh, and as Woody Allen famously said, 80% of success is just showing up. The Pareto principle is everywhere. Which is good. By focusing on just 20% of what's wrong, you can often expect to solve 80% of the problems. A variety of different unrelated factors cause this to be true from case to case. But if we can get to the bottom of what causes some of them, maybe we'll find that one or more of those mechanisms is responsible for Ziff's law in language. George Ziff himself thought language's interesting rank frequency distribution was a consequence of the principle of least effort, the tendency for life and things to follow the path of least resistance. Ziff believed it drove much of human behavior and hypothesized that as language developed in our species, speakers naturally preferred drawing from as few words as possible to get their thoughts out there. It was easier. But in order to understand what was being said, listeners preferred larger vocabularies that gave more specificity so that they had to do less work. The compromise between listening and speaking, Ziff felt, led to the current state of language. A few words are used often and many, many, many words are used rarely. Recent papers have suggested that having a few short often used predictable words helps dissipate information load density on listeners, spacing out important vocab so that the information rate is more constant. This makes sense and much has been learned by applying the least effort principle to other behaviors, but later researchers argued that for language, the explanation was even more simple. Just a few years after Ziff's seminal paper, Benoit Mandelbrot showed that there may be nothing mysterious about Ziff's law at all because even if you just randomly type on a keyboard, you will produce words distributed according to Ziff's law. It's a pretty cool point and this is why it happens. There are exponentially more different long words than short words. For instance, the English alphabet can be used to make 26 one-letter words, but 26 squared two-letter words. Also, in random typing, whenever the space bar is pressed, a word terminates. Since there's always a certain chance that the space bar will be pressed, longer stretches of time before it happens are exponentially less likely than shorter ones. The combination of these exponentials is pretty zippy. For example, if all 26 letters and the space bar are equally likely to be typed after a letter is typed and a word has begun, the probability that the next input will be a space, thus creating a one-letter word, is just 1 in 27. And sure enough, if you randomly generate characters or hire a proverbial typing monkey, about one out of every 27 or 3.7 percent of the stuff between spaces will be single letters. Two-letter words appear when after beginning a word, any character but the space bar is hit. A 26 and 27 chance and then the space bar. A three-letter word is the probability of a letter, another letter, and then a space. If we divide by the number of unique words of each length there can be, we get the frequency of occurrence expected for any particular word given its length. For example, the letter V will make up about 0.142 percent of random typing. The word Vsauce, 0.0000000993 percent. Longer words are less likely, but watch this. Let's spread these frequencies out according to the ranks they'd take up on a most often used list. There are 26 possible one-letter words, so each of the top 26 ranked words are expected to occur about this often. The next 676 ranks will be taken up by two-letter words that show up about this often. If we extend each frequency according to how many members it has, we get Zif. Subsequent researchers have detailed how changing up the initial conditions can smooth the steps out. Our mysterious distribution has been created out of nothing but the inevitabilities of math. So maybe there is no mystery. Maybe words are just the result of humans randomly segmenting the observable world and the mental world into labels, and Zif's law describes what naturally happens when you do that. Case closed. And as always, thanks for watching. Wait a minute. Actual language is very different from random typing. Communication is deterministic to a certain extent. Utterances and topics arrive based on what was said before. And the vocabulary we have to work with certainly isn't the result of purely random naming. For example, the monkey typing model can't explain why even the names of the elements, the planets, and the days of the week are used in language according to Zif's law. Sets like these are constrained by the natural world and they're not the result of us randomly segmenting the world into labels. Furthermore, when given a list of novel words, words they've never heard or used before, like when prompted to write a story about alien creatures with strange names, people will naturally tend to use the name of one alien twice as often as another, three times as often as another. Zif's law appears to be built into our brains. Perhaps there is something about the way thoughts and topics of discussion ebb and flow that contributes to Zif's law. Another way Zipfian distributions occur is via processes that change according to how they've previously operated. These are called preferential attachment processes. They occur when something, money, views, attention, variation, friends, jobs, anything really, is given out according to how much is already possessed. To go back to the carpet example, if most people walk from the living room to the kitchen across a certain path, furniture will be placed elsewhere, making that path even more popular. The more views a video or image or post has, the more likely it is to get recommended automatically or make the news for having so many views, both of which give it more views. It's like a snowball rolling down a snowy hill. The more snow it accumulates, the bigger its surface area becomes for collecting more and the faster it grows. There doesn't have to be a deliberate choice driving a preferential attachment process. It can happen naturally. Try this. Take a bunch of paper clips and grab any two at random. Link them together and then throw them back in the pile. Now repeat over and over again. If you grab paper clips that are already part of a chain, link them anyway. More often than not, after a while you will have a distribution that looks Zipfian. A small number of chains contain a disproportionate amount of the total paperclip count. This is simply because the longer a chain gets, the greater proportion of the whole it contains, which gives it a better chance of being picked up in the future and consequently made even longer. The rich get richer, the big get bigger, the popular get popularer. It's just math. Perhaps language's Zipf mystery is, if not caused by, at least strengthened by preferential attachment. Once a word is used, it's more likely to be used again soon. Critical points may play a role as well. Writing and conversation often stick to a topic until a critical point is reached and the subject is changed and the vocabulary shifts. Processes like these are known to result in power laws. So in the end, it seems tenable that all these mechanisms might collude to make Zipf's law the most natural way for language to be. Perhaps some of our vocabulary and grammar was developed randomly, according to Mandelbrot's theory, and the natural way conversation and discussion follow preferential attachment and criticality coupled with the principle of least effort when speaking and listening are all responsible for the relationship between word rank and frequency. It's a shame that the answer isn't simpler, but it's fascinating because of the consequences it has on what communication is made of. Roughly speaking, and this is mind-blowing, nearly half of any book, conversation or article, will be nothing but the same 50 to 100 words and nearly the other half will be words that appear in that selection only once. That's not so surprising when you consider the fact that one word accounts for 6% of what we say. The top 25 most used words make up about a third of everything we say and the top 100? About half. Seriously, I mean, whether it's all the words in Wet Hot American Summer or all the words in Plato's Complete Works or in the Complete Works of Edgar Allan Poe or the Bible itself, only about 100 words are used for nearly half of everything written or said. In Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, 44%, and in Tom Sawyer, 49.8% of the unique words used appear only once in the book. A word that is used only once in a given selection of words is called a hapeax legamina. Hapax legamina are vitally important to understanding languages. If a word has only been found once in the entire known collection of an ancient language, it can be very difficult to figure out what it means. Now, there is no corpus of everything ever said or written in English, but there are very, very large collections and it's fun to find hapeax legamina in them. For instance, and this probably won't be the case after I mention it, but the word quesaciously is in the Oxford English Dictionary but appears nowhere on Wikipedia or in the Gutenberg Corpus or in the British National Corpus or the American National Corpus, but it does appear when searched in just one result on Google. Fittingly, in a book titled Elders Speak that lists it as a rare word. Quesaciously, by the way, means in a mocking manner, as in the Paradist rattled off quesaciously, Hey, Vsauce, Michael here, but who is Michael and how much does here weigh? It's a little sad that quesaciously has been used so infrequently. It's a fun word, but that's the way things go in a Scythian system. Some things get all the love, some get little. Most of what you experience on a day-to-day basis is forgotten, forgettable. The Dictionary of Obscure Sorrows, as it often does, has a word for this, olica, the awareness of how few days are memorable. I've been alive for almost 11,000 days, but I couldn't tell you something about each one of them. I mean, not even close. Most of what we do and see and think and say and hear and feel is forgotten at a rate quite similar to Zipf's Law, which makes sense. If a number of factors naturally selected for thinking and talking about the world with tools in a Scythian way, it makes sense we'd remember it that way too. Some things really well, most things hardly at all. But it bums me out sometimes because it means that so much is forgotten. Even things that at the time you thought you could never forget. My locker number, senior year. Its combination. The jokes I liked when I saw a comedian on stage. The names of people I saw every day 10 years ago. So many memories are gone. When I look at all the books I've read and realize that I can't remember every detail from them, it's a little disappointing. I mean, why even bother if the Pareto Principle dictates that my Scythian mind will consciously remember pretty much only the titles and a few basic reactions years later? Ralph Waldo Emerson makes me feel better. He once said, I cannot remember the books I've read any more than the meals I have eaten. Even so, they have made me.

Michael here. Nictophobia is the fear of the dark. But there's another fear that's more chilling. It's the fear that darkness will go away. Optophobia. The fear of opening your eyes. Light travels at the fastest speed possible for a physical object. Darkness is erased when light appears and returns when light leaves. The speed of dark is the speed of light, but there are other types of darkness that can move faster than light speed. For instance, a shadow. Across a distance, a shadow can become much larger than the object creating it, but still mimic its source, moving in the same way for the same amount of time. So when a shadow is bigger than the object casting it, it moves a greater distance when the object moves, but in the same amount of time. Make a shadow large enough and it can travel across a surface faster than light. If you, here on Earth, cast a shadow onto the moon, not an easy thing to do, that pointed from, say, point A on the moon's surface, and then you moved your finger so that the shadow moved to point B, your finger would only move a few centimeters in a fraction of a second, but the shadow it cast on the moon would move thousands of kilometers in the same amount of time. Do it right and you're easily producing a shadow that breaks the light barrier. But nothing's wrong here. The rule is that information can't travel faster than light. You can't cause something to happen somewhere else faster than light could travel from you to that somewhere else. And our superluminal shadow is transferring no information from point A to point B. Sure, point B is being cast into darkness sooner than a light speed message from A could warn him it's coming, but darkness isn't traveling from point A to point B. It's traveling from you to point A and point B at the speed of light. What we tend to call a shadow is really just a cross-section of a three-dimensional region. The darkness you are causing only changes shape when newly unblocked light fills the previous gap. That's all a shadow is, a gap. So in a way, a shadow doesn't travel at all. That's an illusion caused by us thinking that a shadow is a physical thing, when in reality a shadow is just the lack of physical things, photons, which chug along at the speed limit of the universe. But that doesn't mean two shadows can't kiss. Or at least look like they are. Watch as Guy brings two shadows near each other. Right before they actually make contact, the shadows seem to magically bulge toward one another in a sort of smooch of darkness. What's going on is the shadow blister effect and it has to do with the anatomy of a shadow. The region where an object completely blocks a light source is called the umbra. It's the darkest part of a shadow and the most prototypical part of the shadow. Where only a portion of the light source is blocked, we find the fainter penumbra. But as two or more penumbras approach and overlap, the combined amount of light they block can be enough to produce a perceivable difference, the shadow blister. The Earth has a big umbra. It's 1.4 million kilometers long. That's how far away you'd have to be from the Earth for it to no longer have a large enough apparent diameter to block out all of the Sun. Here on the surface of Earth we are nowhere near that far away, which is why night is so umbral. Night is just the Earth's shadow falling on you. A you eclipse. Sunsets are cool. They're beautiful to look at, but look the other way and you can see the lumbering shadow of our planet. Our atmosphere scatters shorter wavelengths of light more than longer wavelengths, which makes the sky appear blue. But in Earth's shadow there's less light to scatter and the sky appears darker. During twilight you can see the demarcation. While driving east from Denver to Kansas City I got a particularly great view of it. This is Earth's approaching night-making shadow. The beautiful pink band above it? That's the belt of Venus. It's caused by the sky reflecting the colors of the sunset behind us. You've probably noticed that right after the Sun sets and disappears from view, there's still light in the sky scattered from the no longer visible Sun. This is what we call twilight and there are many different stages of twilight. If the Sun is less than six degrees below the horizon it's technically civil twilight. You can still do plenty of stuff outdoors without the need for artificial lights. Down to 12 degrees below the horizon we have nautical twilight. Artificial lights are more or less necessary but the sky still scatters enough light to be bright enough for ships at sea to navigate by seeing a contrast at the horizon between dark sea and faintly lit sky. Down to 18 degrees an astronomical twilight is occurring. It looks like night but the sky can still get darker. Until astronomical twilight ends not all nighttime astronomical observations can be made. Below 18 degrees is technically, honestly, night. If you live at greater than 48.5 degrees north or south latitude during the summer the Sun never goes more than 18 degrees below the horizon. It's never technically night. Places like London only reach astronomical twilight at the most during these months. So if you live in one of these areas and you want to avoid doing something during the summer just tell people you'll do it tonight. You'll buy yourself a few weeks. But that's slow darkness. Let's cut to the chase because we are looking for fast darkness. When scissor blades snip the intersection point between both blades moves faster than the blades themselves. Think of it this way. If you had a pair of scissors with blades that were a light year long and it took one second to close them, the intersection point would have traveled an entire light year in not a year but a second. No laws are being broken here because such a snip would be physically impossible. As I've mentioned before rigid objects don't move instantaneously all over when a push force is applied to them. Instead that force moves via electromagnetic forces from one atom to the next and so on down the line. A compression wave that travels at the speed of sound through the material. But what if we ignored that problem by allowing the blades to simply be separately already in motion? Well, their point of intersection can still travel faster than light because it's not a physical thing. It's just a geometric point and it carries no more information than you could already gather by witnessing the approaching blades. But don't count out that geometric point of intersection just yet. It's the key to another type of darkness that can move faster than light. When waves collide their crests can fuse into larger crests, their troughs in the larger troughs. This is constructive interference. But crests colliding with troughs cancel out. Destructive interference. If these waves are light, the result is darkness. And in certain circumstances, darkness created this way can travel like the intersection between two lines. Faster than light. Imagine these concentric circles as waves of light. The lines are wave crests and the gaps in between are troughs. When they meet, the points where they intersect flee up and down faster than the waves travel, especially in the middle, which in the case of light waves makes them faster than light. The superluminal speeds of these dark patches can be seen really clearly if we make the wave crests of one source black as well as the background. Overlapping regions where red peaks through represent destructive interference. Darkness. And you can see how, especially in the middle, this darkness races up and down faster than the waves. In 1995, a man named MacArthur Wheeler robbed a bank in Pittsburgh. He was caught because his only disguise was lemon juice. He covered his face with it. He knew that lemon juice could be used as an invisible ink when writing on paper, revealed by heating. And he knew so little about why that worked and he knew so little about how cameras worked that he assumed with extreme confidence that lemon juice could make him invisible too. Seriously. Wheeler is an extreme example and was the inspiration for the Dunning-Kruger effect. Novices, people unskilled in particular disciplines, will often overestimate their knowledge and abilities in said disciplines because they don't even know how little they know, how much more there is to learn. On the flip side, experts in particular fields will often underestimate their knowledge, have less confidence in their abilities, or think that everyone else has the same level of knowledge that they do. What drives the Dunning-Kruger effect is the fact that often the more you learn about something, the more you realize just how rich and complex and overwhelming and full of as-of-yet-unanswered questions it really is. George Bernard Shaw once famously toasted Albert Einstein by saying science is always wrong. It never solves a problem without creating ten more. Einstein didn't exactly disagree. He used geometry to illustrate how ignorance grows faster than knowledge, saying as our circle of knowledge expands, so does the circumference of darkness surrounding it. Learning, studying, shedding light on a field of inquiry also reveals just how in the dark we continue to be, how many shadowy things there are left for us to illuminate. The diameter of light never exceeds the shadowy circumference. But what's the speed of that kind of dark? The speed of the growth of the number of things we know we are in the dark about? What's the speed of ignorance? If we define ignorance as the difference between questions we know to ask and answers we have, the field of agnotology, the study of ignorance suggests that the amount of things we know we are in the dark about is growing faster than the amount of things we have shed light on. Is it a coincidence that the phrase in the dark originated during of all ages the age of enlightenment? When Leeuwenhoek put a scraping from his tooth under a collection of magnifying lenses he built, he saw for the first time in human history little moving creatures, microorganisms. He called them animalcules. The discovery shed light on why food spoiled. Life didn't spontaneously come from old meat. It was already there. We just couldn't see it. But the discovery also showed us that we were in the dark about an entirely new realm of biology. As Philippe Bordeaux has poetically put it, enlightenment leads to benightedness. Science entails nescience. What's really cool about the expanding size of our nescience circumference is what Stuart Feierstein, the chair of biological sciences at Columbia University, has said about it. It is there that science begins, where the facts run out just beyond them. He says it is a mistake to bob around in the circle of facts instead of riding the wave to the great expanse lying outside the circle. If science is a road trip, facts are the photos we take along the way. The fuel that drives it forward is ignorance. Facts? More like facts. Part of the past, not the way forward. When it comes to understanding our world, knowing why is obsolesced by asking why. Knowing facts makes you bright, but the equally quick, sometimes quicker, and most rewarding prize is the dark, in admitting that you don't know everything, but that you'd like to know some of it. And as always, thanks for watching.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1993\n","\n","Link  303 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/ffUnNaQTfZE\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/ffUnNaQTfZE\n","[youtube] ffUnNaQTfZE: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] ffUnNaQTfZE: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 19.57MiB in 05:45\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Hey Vsauce, Michael here. Now one of my favorite treats of the holiday season is Gabriel's cake. It's a super solid based on Gabriel's horn that you can make right at home. As long as your home is infinitely large. Okay, alright now the first thing you want to do is bake a cake. I prepared this cake earlier. It's a real beautiful cake. It's a little large but I bet you I could eat that whole thing in a day if I tried. Am I right? Okay now the second step is cut the cake in half. Notice that while I cut this cake in half you don't add or create any new cake. But the surface area of the cake has increased. It used to be completely covered and now we've got two regions on the inside that aren't covered. The next step is to cut this half, one of the halves, in half. Here we go. Again, the volume of cake on the table is the same as it was in the beginning but the surface area is going up. As you may be able to guess, the next step is going to be to cut one of these quarters of the original cake in half. Oh yeah, it's getting pretty thin but all you have to do is keep this up. Cutting halves in half and half and half and half forever and once you've done that, well you're almost there. When you finish cutting, stack the halves on top of one another in order, like this, to create a beautiful tiered dessert. Because you have an infinite number of thinner and thinner slices, when you're done stacking them, the cake's vertical height will be endless. Such a cake has an interesting mathematical property. Its volume, the amount of cake it contains, is clearly no different than the amount you started with but its surface area is infinite. It's a cake you can eat but not frost. You would need an infinite amount of frosting to cover the whole thing with a uniform coat, an object with finite volume. But infinite surface area doesn't need to be endlessly tall, by the way. There are bounded super solids, like this cube with an infinite number of smaller and smaller circular holes. Of course, building these objects in the real world comes with some obvious difficulties. One is the fact that the amount of steps required to complete the construction of Gabriel's cake or any other super solid is literally infinitely many. And infinity isn't a number that, you know, you eventually get to. It means unending. There will always be a next step, another piece to slice in half again. By definition, an infinite sequence of tasks has no last task. So you could never finish making a super solid. Or could you? Enter the super task. What if instead of taking the same amount of time to complete each step, we accelerated as we worked and did each step in half the time as the last? For example, let's say you want to make Gabriel's cake in just two minutes. That's easy. First, cut the original cake in half and then wait a minute before making the second cut. Wait half a minute before making the third, a quarter of a minute before the fourth and so on. Always waiting for half of what's left to pass before cutting again. Since you can keep dividing in half forever, there will always be another step. Infinite actions within a finite amount of time is a super task. The strange thing, of course, is that while super tasking, no matter how many steps you've already completed, there will always be an infinite amount of steps ahead. But yet, when time's up, you will have finished all of them. What we've just described is similar to Zeno's famous Paradox of the Dichotomy, in which the Greek hero Achilles runs a short race that he can clearly finish. I mean, people finish races all the time. But how exactly it's finished is a mystery. Because first, Achilles must cover half of the race's distance and then half of what's left and half again and again and again. Since there will always be another halfway point to reach, the number of subdivisions is infinite, there is no final destination, after which Achilles' next stop is the finish line. But yet, Achilles obviously can finish. He somehow reaches them all, despite the fact that during his journey he always has an infinite number of steps left to reach. Think about it this way. What if at each halfway step along the way, Achilles is required to hold up a flag. At even steps, a blue flag. And at odd steps, a red flag. Blue, red, blue, red, blue, red. The flags will alternate faster and faster. But when Achilles finishes the race, which flag will he be holding up? To be holding up either flag would seem to suggest that a largest number not only exists, but is either even or odd. Now, to this, it is often suggested that the real problem here is that Achilles isn't actually doing infinitely many things. He's just taking a few strides or whatever. A true super task requires doing infinitely many distinct actions. Fair enough. But even if Achilles ran the race in a staccato fashion, stopping at each halfway point for half as long as he waited at the last one, the scenario would still be sensical and logical and would complete in a finite amount of time. It has even been shown how a staccato runner could move to avoid discontinuous velocities and accelerations. The point is, fine. Infinite distinct actions are at least logically possible to do in a finite amount of time, but only logically, only as a mathematical abstraction. Super tasks are obviously just products of our imagination. Because in the real world, there must be some smallest amount of space and or time that cannot be meaningfully divided in half again. Once you're within one of these distances of the finish line, the only possible next position you can have is the finish line. That certainly seems fair. After all, it's believed that in reality there is a smallest meaningful distance. The Planck length. Any interactions between or observations of particles more accurate than this span make no sense within physics as we understand it today. And the time it would take to travel a Planck length at the fastest speed possible, the speed of light, is the Planck time. So these seem to be the briefest pieces of space and time any known force in the universe could act across, whether that forces gravity or a force from Achilles' leg muscles. But does that resolve the crisis? Or is it just a way of avoiding the problem altogether by saying it doesn't matter because it won't be on the test? As John Ehrman has complained, it seems to me unattractive to make the truth of mathematical statements depend on the contingencies of space-time structure. Maybe Zeno's dichotomy tells us less about motion and time and space and truth than it does about our impressive abilities to confuse ourselves. And that's what makes supertasks important. They're a contact point, an uneasy handshake of sorts between the universe we live in and the brains inside us. Let's play around with some. They're not all the same. Some converge, like Zeno's dichotomy. Others converge, but in ways you may not expect. And still others refuse to cooperate in any way. They diverge. A great example of a supertask whose behavior diverges is Thompson's lamp. A famous supertask devised by James F. Thompson. Imagine a lamp that can be turned on and off as quickly as you desire. What would happen if you turned such a lamp on and off Zeno-ianly? Well, let's find out. Just set a timer and turn the lamp on. Then wait one minute and turn it off. After half a minute, turn it back on, and then off again after a quarter of a minute. On again after an eighth of a minute, and so on, waiting half as long to flip the switch each time as you previously did. Now, as the number of switchings grows without bound, the total time elapsed approaches just 2 minutes. The lamp will be turned on and off an infinite number of times in just 2 minutes. So after 2 minutes, will the lamp be on or off? Well, by the definition of infinity, there is no last step. There is never a switching not followed by another. So the lamp can't be on because whenever it's turned on, it is immediately turned off in the next step, and it can't be off because whenever it's turned off, it's turned on right afterwards. What's the answer? It's easy to say something about a supertask when its partial sums converge, but when they just oscillate back and forth forever, hmmm. Zeno objects do this. Imagine building a meter high cube. As with all supertasks, you construct at an accelerated pace. First, you put down a green half meter tall slab. Then a quarter meter tall slab that's orange. Then a green eighth meter slab, then an orange sixteenth meter slab and so on until there are infinitely many layers of alternating color. Now, when you look at the cube from above, what color will you see? Orange? Green? Well, it can't be orange because every orange layer is covered by a green one. And it can't be green because every green layer is blocked by an orange one above it. What if we had a machine display each digit of pi in order at a supertask pace? After its finite runtime, what would be on the screen? The last digit of pi? Well that's impossible, right? But how could it be anything else? A supertask allows us to exhaust an infinite sequence. Paul Benserov delivered what is often considered the best response to these confusions. Is Thompson's lamp on or off? Is the cube orange or green? The answer is we don't know because these questions are incomplete. Thompson's lamp could be on or off or broken. The cube could appear orange or green or something else. But the supertasks, as stated, don't let us figure out which. I may as well ask you if a lamp hidden in a locked room is on or off. It's definitely one or the other, but I haven't given you enough information to do anything but guess. Supertasks like these describe an endless sequence of tasks and then ask us about the end. But we can't determine an outcome because although there may be an end to their duration, there is no end, no final member of their actions. They must be reworded or coupled with extra assumptions in order to be solved. For example, if we assume that the switch used on Thompson's lamp can only be all the way on or all the way off, we can't determine where it is after the supertask. But if the switch is, say, a bouncing ball that completes the circuit, turning the lamp on each time it bounces on a metal plate, an outcome can be determined. If the physics here are ideal and the ball bounces half as high and half the time as it did on the previous bounce, its sequence of bounce heights will turn the lamp on and off an infinite number of times in a finite amount of time. Although this bouncing ball has no penultimate state, no second to last bounce, it does have an ultimate state, a final one, resting on the plate. The circuit will be complete and the lamp will be on. You can also describe a switch on Thompson's lamp that leaves it off. Sometimes, the next state after infinitely many isn't paradoxical because of lack of information, but because of a surprising or non-intuitive discontinuity that occurs there. The Ross-Littlewood paradox is one of the greatest examples. Imagine a giant urn that can hold an unlimited number of balls. Now, imagine that you have an unlimited supply of balls, each with a unique natural number written on it. All natural numbers, in fact, since there's no end to how many balls you have. Now, working at an accelerated, zenoian pace, you move the balls to the urn 10 at a time, but in a weird way. At step one, you place balls number one to 10 in the urn, but remove number one. At step two, a minute later, you place balls 11 to 20 in the urn and remove ball number two. At step three, you place balls 21 to 30 in the urn and remove ball three, and so on. Upon the completion of the super task, how many balls will be in the urn? At first, the answer seems obvious. At each step, you are adding 10 balls and subtracting one, so a net of nine balls is added each time. Nine plus nine plus nine plus nine forever. The series grows without end. Infinite nines means infinite balls at the end. But here's the problem. At each step, the ball with that step's number written on it is removed. Ball one is removed at step one. Ball two is removed at step two. Ball 12 Google is removed at step 12 Google. Since there are an endless number of steps for any ball number, there is a step number at which it is removed. So although the urn's ball population grows without bound during the task, after the super task, the number drops to zero. It gets weirder. Here's a second seemingly identical method. Instead of beginning with balls one to ten and then removing one, begin with balls one to nine. Then write zero after the one on ball one. For step two, add balls 11 to 19 and draw a zero on ball two, making it say 20. For every finite step, both methods result in identical urn contents. After infinitely many steps, the first leaves us with no balls and the second leaves us with infinitely many balls written on which are all the natural numbers each followed by an infinite string of zeros. Both are discontinuous at infinity, but dang, in very different ways. The bigger question now becomes, so what? Who cares? You will never have an infinite number of balls and you will never have a large enough urn to hold all of them. You will never build a lamp that can turn on and off arbitrarily fast. We cannot investigate time or space past a certain smallness except when pretending. So what are super tasks but recreational fictions, entertaining riddles? We can ask more questions than we can answer. So what? Well, here's what. Neanderthals. Neanderthals and humans, us homo sapiens, lived together in Europe for at least 5,000 years. Neanderthals were strong and clever. They may have even intentionally buried their dead, but for hundreds of thousands of years, Neanderthals barely went anywhere. They pretty much just explored and spread until they reached water or some other obstacle and then stopped. Homo sapiens, on the other hand, didn't do that. They did things that made no sense, crossing terrain and water without knowing what lay ahead. Svante Pabow has worked on the Neanderthal genome at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology and he points out that technology alone didn't allow humans to go to Madagascar, to Australia. Neanderthals built boats too. Instead, he says, there's, quote, some madness there. How many people must have sailed out and vanished on the Pacific before you found Easter Island? I mean, it's ridiculous. And why do you do that? Is it for the glory? For immortality? For curiosity? And now we go to Mars. We never stop. It's ridiculous. Foolish? Maybe. But it was the Neanderthals who went extinct, not the humans. Maybe it's only a fool who will perilously journey out to what might not be there. And maybe it's only a fool who will ask about supertasks, about infinity. But if you want to solve problems, you don't just solve the ones that are there, you find more and make more and go after the impossible ones. Fostering a love and obsession with problems is how you solve problems. Antoine de Saint-Exupery wasn't a mathematician, but his advice fits nicely here. If you want to build a ship, don't drum up people to collect wood and don't assign them tasks and work, but rather teach them to long for the endless immensity of the sea.

Michael here. This symbol, commonly called a yin-yang symbol, is a tae-ji-tu, meaning diagram of the supreme ultimate. The principle of yin and yang, opposites existing in harmony, is associated with ancient Chinese philosophy, but the very first use of the iconography, the classic symbol, actually comes from a shield pattern used by the ancient Romans 700 years before its first known use in China. A connection between the two has yet to be found. Regardless of who came up with it first, the symbol was a bright idea. But what's the brightest object in the entire universe? Well, apparent magnitude, commonly used when stargazing refers to how bright an object appears to us, say when looking up from Earth. It depends on Earth-centric factors like how close the object is to our planet. Magnitudes are logarithmic and arranged like golf, where a smaller number means a greater brightness. But today I'm looking for absolute magnitude, a measure of how bright things all over the universe, near and far, would be if we looked at them from the same distance. Absolute magnitude will guide us to the most blinding light in the universe, irrespective of it looking faint to us here on Earth just because it's far away. The difference is significant. A 100 watt light bulb placed closer than 8 centimeters, about 3 inches from your eye, will appear brighter than the Sun in the sky. But that's not fair. If you could see the Sun and the bulb from the same distance, the Sun would be a septillion times brighter. That's bright. But the Sun shines punally compared to the rest of the cosmos. If you could line the Sun up with everything else out there, giving every star and cosmological phenomenon a fair chance, the Sun's absolute magnitude would be 4.8. Not bad. But check out R136A1. This nuclear-fueled beast isn't the biggest star in terms of volume, but it's 256 times more massive than our Sun. It's the most massive star ever found and it's also the brightest. Remember that lower absolute magnitudes are brighter. R136A1 isn't 4.8 like our Sun. It is negative 12.6, which means it is 8.7 million times brighter than our own Sun. But R136A1 isn't the brightest thing out there. When a giant star dies, it explodes violently in what is known as a supernova or hypernova. As I mentioned in my video How Hot Can It Get, supernovas can eject terrifying flashes of radiation known as gamma-ray bursts, arguably the brightest electromagnetic events in the universe. A typical gamma-ray burst releases as much energy in a few seconds as our Sun will release altogether in its entire 10 billion year lifetime. If WR104, a gamma-ray burst future candidate, directly struck Earth with such a beam for only 10 seconds, astronomers predict it could deplete 25 percent of our ozone layer and lead to mass extinction and starvation. The largest thermonuclear bomb ever detonated didn't do anything close to that and it was exploded right here in our atmosphere. Whereas WR104 is 8,000 light-years away. You can't even see it with your naked eye or a pair of binoculars. But gamma-ray bursts are merely brief events lasting only a few minutes at most, sometimes just a matter of milliseconds. If you want the brightest sustained thing, you'll paradoxically have to look at the darkest thing, black holes. To be fair, dark matter is ostensibly darker, but because dark matter has been hypothesized to not even interact with light, with electromagnetism at all, calling dark matter not bright is kind of like calling your peanut butter sandwich a not-fast airplane. It's not really even the same category. Black holes, however, do interact with light, reflecting so little, well, they don't let any escape, at least not in a form resembling the way it came in. That's dark. But the intense energies created by black holes in the process of eating things like stars is anything but dark. Gas and debris from the stars they eat swirl into archapluvian cosmic gallows known as accretion disks before making their final death plunge into the black hole. In the disk, debris spins at unfathomable speeds pulled around by a black hole billions of times more massive than our Sun. Friction in the accretion disk generates heat on a level difficult to fully appreciate. Just as hot things glow, the disk does too. So brightly, it has its own name, a quasar. Quasars shine thousands of times more brightly than even the brightest stars. I'm kidding. It's scarier than that. Quasars shine thousands of times more brightly than galaxies containing billions of stars. The first identified quasar, 3C273, has an absolute magnitude of negative 26.7, making it four trillion times brighter than our Sun. About 100 times more luminous than the total amount of light produced by the entire Milky Way. If you put 3C273 33 light-years away from us, it would shine as brightly as our Sun, a mere eight light-minutes away. Blocking the brightness of a quasar with a coronagraph reveals that quasars exist in the centers of galaxies that are larger than them in area but are nonetheless drowned out by their light. Such galactic centers are called active galactic nuclei, the bulk of their energy spewing forth in the form of a powerful radiation jet, the length of which puts even our solar system to shame. The visible part of the jet in this photograph, for instance, is so long it could stretch from the Sun to Pluto and back one and a half million times. Now, specifically, if a large portion of this ejected energy heads toward Earth, it's responsible for what we call a quasar. But if Earth is right in the active galactic nucleus's sites, it's got a scarier name, a blazar. And it's blazar 3C 454.3 that clocked in the greatest brightness ever observed. At historically high levels of activity, it registered an absolute magnitude of negative 31.4. To put the brightness of quasars in yet another perspective, take a look at the 100,000th picture snapped by the Hubble telescope. This is a star a few hundred light-years away, and this thing looks just about as bright, but it is a quasar 9 billion light-years away. Why are quasars so far away? Well, a quasar is not forever. They are billions of light-years away, which means the light we receive from them, the pictures we take of them are pictures of things happening billions of years ago. They represent a phenomenon more common early in the universe's history, when monster black holes hadn't eaten all the stars around them to fuel their accretion discs and before those holes became too fat to be active. Neil deGrasse Tyson points out that in order to remain a quasar producer, a black hole must consume about 10 stars a year. Many consume more than a thousand stars a year, 600 Earth's worth of matter every single minute. The more stars a black hole consumes, the larger its event horizon becomes until eventually it no longer shreds stars apart to fuel an accretion disc. Instead it just swallows them whole in one dimmer, but still terrifying, gulp. Quasars are some of the most ancient things in our universe. If you could teleport instantaneously to one right now, faster than light, it would most likely no longer be burning. What we see are just their ghosts, light that left when they were active, that traveled longer than they could live. But quasars can still be born. They can even be born right here, in fact. In my video, What Will We Miss?, I pointed out that the Andromeda galaxy is headed our way. In three to five billion years, it will collide with our own galaxy, the Milky Way, and the collision could rearrange stars near the galaxy's central black holes to be consumed, reigniting a quasar right here in our galactic backyard. Funny enough, right now very few of us even see Andromeda, even though all you need is your unaided eye. Light from our cities drowns out the night sky like a quasar drowns out its host galaxy. Artist Thierry Cohen mocked up what big cities would look like if all their lights were off and the sky above them could be seen fully. New York, Hong Kong, Shanghai, Tokyo, Los Angeles. It's beautiful and rare. In the 1990s, during a blackout in the city of Los Angeles, a number of residents actually called the police. They were afraid of mysterious glowing clouds hovering above the city. They were seeing our galaxy for the first time in their lives. At night, artificial lights allow us to see what's around us, but we lose what's above us. The brightest places have the darkest, emptiest skies. There's yin and yang again. A taijitu has actually been lurking in this video the entire time. The brightest things in the universe, quasars, are caused by the darkest things in the universe, black holes. The process that unshackles the most light is caused by the thing that best imprisons it. And as always, thanks for watching.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1532\n","\n","Link  305 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/U6VBV4QUMu0\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/U6VBV4QUMu0\n","[youtube] U6VBV4QUMu0: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] U6VBV4QUMu0: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 20.48MiB in 05:03\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Hey, Vsauce! Michael here. Why, though? Why are any of us here? What's the purpose? What does it all mean? Well, sometimes, if we listen closely enough, when we ask, why, we can hear an answer. And it's another question. Why? Why what? Our journey begins here. Checking the rule book. If you want to find anything in there that says a dog can't play. He's right! Ain't no rule that says a dog can't play basketball! Is that true? Is there really no rule against a dog playing middle school basketball? Vsauce Magic 8 Ball. Is there really no rule against a dog playing basketball? The answer is yes. Or is it? We have begun. The actor who played Air Bud, Buddy the dog, passed away in 1998 at the age of nine. Now take a look at this. Let's talk about World War I. On June 28, 1914, Franz Ferdinand, the heir to the throne of Austria-Hungary, and his wife Sophie were assassinated in Sarajevo while riding in a car. The car's license plate was A-I-I-I-1-1-8. They were killed by Gavrilo Princip, who said during his trial that he wanted the unification of all Yugoslavs, free from Austria. The event sparked a series of escalations in Europe, the July Crisis, which ultimately caused World War I. A war that ended on Armistice Day, November 11, 1918. Pretty odd, huh? A spooky coincidence, if you will. But look, odd things happen all the time. Oddness is all around us, especially in the form of odd numbers. The grip they have on our reality is revealed when we release our grip. Notice anything strange? Under the influence of gravity, things move in an odd way. If something starts moving because of gravity, after, say, one second, it will have traveled some distance. Now, interestingly, during the next second, the distance it will travel will be three times as far as it moved during the first second. During the third second, it will travel five times as far, then seven times, then nine times, 11, 13, 15. We used seconds, but it doesn't matter what time interval you use, you will always find this pattern, the odd number rule. Hiding right there within the very phenomenon that keeps us on Earth are the odd numbers. More like god numbers, right? Is the odd number rule the face of the universe looking back at us? Well, here is something that Galileo wrote. Philosophy is written in this grand book, I mean, the universe, which stands continuously open to our gaze, but it cannot be understood unless one first learns to comprehend the language in which it is written. It is written in the language of mathematics. And its characters are triangles, circles, and other geometric figures without which it is humanly impossible to understand a single word of it. Without these, one is wandering about in a dark labyrinth. Before this pattern in the grand book of the universe was read and appreciated, people wondered why things fell. Maybe stuff just has a desire to be in its own proper place, right? Rocks with the Earth, fire with the air. That makes sense, right? It was fun to imagine causes and write our own stories. But underneath our desire for explanations, a story was already being told. One that is written in the language of mathematics. Measure and relation. Now, many of these stories are being told all around us all the time, one on top of each other. But if we can look past those disturbances, each isolated event is narrating a quiet, simple story. Not of why the universe is, but of what the universe is. Galileo recognized what this pattern spelled. Mathematically, it spells, hello, I am speeding up at a constant rate. And that was huge. All this time. For millennia, we had been wondering about the causes of gravity, its cosmic purpose, why it existed. But now, here was someone saying, yeah, yeah, yeah, cool. But like, what does it do? It makes things fall. Great. Well, what does that mean? What does it mean to fall? Fall how? Now, the human mind alone couldn't answer that. But the universe was telling us. We just had to speak its language and read it. This is, I am gaining velocity at a constant rate spelled with odd numbers. How? Well, what's an odd number? The concept of oddness comes from the observation that sometimes when you have a bunch of things, everything you have can be paired up. But sometimes, that can't happen. Now, when it's possible, when you can pair everything up that you have, it is said that the number of things you have is even. If you can't do that, then the number of things you have is odd. Now, what this means is that the number of objects in an even group is equal to 2 times n, where n is just the number of whole pairs that you have. So n is any whole number. n could be, for example, 50, giving us the even number of 100, which is also the number of legs centipedes have. Or is it? Centipede 100, peed feet. Having 100 legs is right there in the name. But it's only approximate. Centipedes have been observed to have anywhere from 30 to 345 legs. Now, 100 falls pretty nicely in that range. But every pair of legs on a centipede is attached to a body segment, which means that in order to have 100 legs, a centipede would need to have 50 body segments. But not a single species of centipede has an even number of body segments. 50 segments is nowhere to be found in the library of centipede genomes. So, while centipedes, on average, have a number of legs quite close to 100, they never naturally have exactly 100. Point is, 2n is the mathematical way to spell even. If I add just one more thing, the amount I have is no longer even. It's odd. If I add yet another thing, I've added another pair, n has gone up by one, and the number is even again. This means that an even number plus just one more will always be odd. Now that we know how to mathematically spell odd and even, we can move on to moving. If you and me hugged, well that would be wonderful. We would both get so much out of it. But if during the hug, you suddenly ran away from me while yelling, I'm leaving you at a velocity of 2 meters per second, well I would be devastated. But I would know that deep down you still cared for me, because you told me your velocity. And if I know your velocity, I can know just how far away you are from me at all times. All I have to do is take your velocity and multiply it by the number of seconds that have elapsed since you left. Now take a look at what a graph of your velocity would look like. Here we have velocity in meters away from me per second, and we have time in seconds since the hug ended. Now if your velocity is 2 meters per second, and that persists, then here's a graph of your velocity. But look at this. After a number of seconds have elapsed, like after one second, the distance you are away is just the rate times the time elapsed, 2 times 1. Well that also happens to be the area of the rectangle bounded by a line coming up from the time, your velocity graph, and our axes. Well that's pretty convenient. After 2 seconds, you are 2 times 2, 4 meters away from me, which is also the area of this shape we've created. After 3 seconds, you are 3 times 2, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 meters away. It's always the area. Well that's pretty convenient. But let's change up the story. What if we hugged, and it was great. I mean just, almost not even a hug, like something new is being invented here. But then, during that, you suddenly leave. You run away from me, and while you run, you yell, I am leaving you at an ever changing velocity. Well I would say, you know what, that is a lot less helpful. Now let's say that this changing velocity you have, that I don't know, happens to be an acceleration of 2 meters per second per second. What does that mean? Well that means that your velocity is getting bigger by 2 meters per second for every second that you run. It would look like this on a graph. You begin hugging me with no velocity, and then one second later, your velocity is 2 meters per second larger. So 2 larger than 0 is 2, that's your velocity after one second. After 2 seconds, your velocity is 2 larger still, so 4, and then 6, your velocity graph would look something like this. But now here's a question. If you're moving like this, is the distance you are away from me at any given time still just the area of the shape bounded? It's harder to see that because you don't maintain any single velocity for any amount of time. Your velocity is always changing, so we don't have nice rectangles. But we can see that it is true by putting ourselves in my shoes, abandoned, alone. I don't even know your motion, I don't even know how you're accelerating. It's very scary. But I can decide to take matters into my own hands and measure your velocity as often as I like. Let's say that I measure it just once. I measure it after, let's say, 2 seconds. Alright, wonderful. Now the question I want to answer is how far away you are after 3 seconds. Alright, so I have this measurement. I know that you were traveling at 4 meters per second. Well, I mean, look, if you're going 4 meters per second for 1 second, then that's a rectangle like this. And it's got an area of 4. But you're not 4 meters away, are you? You're a lot further than that because you weren't traveling 4 meters per second for this entire second. You were at all times actually traveling a bit faster. And I'm totally forgetting all the distance you covered before my measurement, which is not zero. Okay, so clearly I need to measure your velocity more frequently. So let's say that I measure your velocity twice during the 3 seconds I'm curious about. Let's say I measure it after 1 second and then after 2 seconds. Well, now I can imagine rectangles here. This one is 2 by 1, so it has an area of 2. This one is 4 by 1, so it has an area of 4. 2 plus 4 is 6. But you're a lot more than 6 meters away as well because you weren't traveling 2 meters per second this entire time. You were actually speeding up, covering more and more distance. I'm totally forgetting all the distance you covered over here. Basically, this method will always leave me short. But the more frequently I check your velocity, the better things get. Take a look at this. Oh yeah. Oh wow. As you can see, the more frequently I check your velocity, the closer my calculation gets to being based off of what you really did, your actual motion. But also, the more frequently I check your velocity, the closer the combined area of all of my rectangles gets to simply being equal to the actual area bounded by your velocity curve. Which means that the area under your velocity curve, even when your curve is like this, is still totally the distance you are away from me. Now let's take this knowledge and apply it to the odd number rule. Before people knew how things fell, there were some pretty good guesses. For example, if the reason things fall is that they have within them a desire to be in their own proper place. In this example, the table. Well then maybe the closer this object gets to the table, the more excited it is to be there and the faster it goes. In which case, its velocity would change over time like this, getting steeper and steeper and steeper. But Galileo didn't think that. He believed that when objects fell, their velocities increased at a constant rate. So graphed like this, their velocity would just follow a straight line. Let's draw a straight line. Beautiful. Now, let's divide this graph up into strips of equal time. Perfect. Alright, now, as we know, the areas of the shapes we have bounded here are the distances traveled during their respective time intervals. So what's the area of our first shape here, a little triangle? Well, we don't know what it is. We don't have any actual markings here on our axes, but that's fine. It doesn't really matter. We'll just call this one. So in the first second or the first time interval, our object traveled a distance of one unit of space. Perfect. Now, how far did our object travel during the second time interval? Well, that distance will be equal to that area. Well, what is this area? Well, one thing we can do to make this easier is to divide the shape like this. Now we have two shapes, a triangle and a rectangle. This triangle has the exact same area as our initial triangle. That's because they are congruent triangles. They both have the same base length, and because this velocity line has a constant slope, it rises the same amount per time elapsed all the time. So their heights are the same and they're both right triangles. Their areas are the same. So the area of this space is the area of that triangle plus the area of this rectangle. What is the area of this rectangle? Well, one thing we can do is divide the rectangle in half with a diagonal like this. And look what we've created. This triangle has the exact same area as our initial triangle. It has the same height, it has the same base, they're both right angles. And look, the same goes for this one. It's a right triangle. Its base is the same as this base, its height is the same as this one's height. Gosh, this is just the area of the initial triangle but twice. So we have two of them and we have two of them one time. Okay, perfect. Now let's move on to finding the area of that shape. Once again, I can divide this shape like that. And now I have a triangle, which as we know, has the same area as our initial triangle right here. So we have that area, one. And then we also have, look at that, two rectangles, which as we know, we can divide in half like this, giving us now four triangles equal in area to the initial one. So what we've done is we've taken the initial area and we have doubled it, well, once and then twice, so two times. Now as we continue doing this, we find that we're always adding one more of our original areas and then we're always doubling that original area one more time. Here we've doubled it one, two, three times, doubled three times. Well, look at this pattern. Right here, we can think of one as being equal to two times zero plus one, can't we? Well, these numbers are whole numbers and they're just going up by one, zero, one, two, three. This is all of the general form 2n plus one. That is how you mathematically spell odd. So the odd number rule is not some kind of magical coincidence. It's just what happens when an object's velocity increases at a constant rate. The answer was right there in front of us all along, written in the mathematical language of the universe. The universe also contains Colorado, one of its best rectangles. Or is it? Let's find out after a quick word from our sponsor, us. Hi, I'm Michael Stevens. Are you a person? Well, then get out of here. Go poop or something. I only want to talk to your brain.

Welcome back. Now Colorado looks like a rectangle, a shape with four sides that all meet at the same angle, but Colorado doesn't have four sides. It has 697, making it not a rectangle, but instead a hexahectaenia conticae heptagon. And this was all by mistake. The United States Congress initially defined Colorado as a geospherical rectangle, the space bounded by two lines of latitude and two lines of longitude. In the 19th century, surveyors set out to demarcate its shape, to actually mark it on the ground. And they did a phenomenal job with the tools that they had. But mistakes were made. Some were large enough that you can spot them on many common maps of the state. In 1925, the US Supreme Court ruled that the borders at the borders as surveyed were the correct ones and would legally stand as the official recognized edges of the state, not the originally intended theoretically pure geospherical rectangle. Thus, ending the shaping of Colorado that began with lines drawn by the compromise of 1850. 1850. We have arrived. Article 18, Section 5, Paragraph 0 of the Washington Interscholastic Activities Association, 1996-97 Constitution, the set of rules Air Bud would have been subject to at the time and place of the movie, states that in order to participate in an interscholastic athletic activity, like basketball, a student must be a, quote, regular member of the school, defined as someone enrolled half-time or more. The section does refer to RCW 28A 225010, a list of approved exceptions, but not one of these was considered in the case of Air Bud. Had they been, it would have been discovered quite quickly that Air Bud the dog qualified under absolutely none of them. There is no rule that specifically states a dog cannot play basketball, but there are and were rules that said that this dog, Air Bud, should not have been allowed to play basketball.

If you core a sphere, that is remove a cylinder from it, you'll be left with a shape called a napkin ring because, well, it looks like a napkin ring. It's a bizarre shape because if two napkin rings have the same height, well, they'll have the same volume regardless of the size of the spheres they came from. This means that if you cut equally tall napkin rings from an orange and from the earth, well, one could be held in your hand, the other would have the circumference of our entire planet, but both would have the same volume. I mentioned this counterintuitive fact while making a kendama with Adam Savage, check that video out if you haven't. Or better yet, just come see us, we're bringing brain candy live to 24 new cities this fall. It's going to be busy, but right now we're talking about balls and coring them. I have here two napkin rings from very differently sized spheres. One is from a tiny ball, just a little tomato that I've cored, so it's got a little hole in it right there. The other napkin ring is made from an orange, but both napkin rings have the same height. The tomato has a smaller circumference than the orange, which means less volume, but its ring is thicker, which means more volume. Both of those effects exactly cancel out, so these two napkin rings have identical volumes. They take up the same amount of space. By the way, orange oil is flammable. To see why the napkin ring problem is true, let's discuss Cavalieri's principle. It states that for any two solids, like these two cylinders I've built here, sandwiched between parallel planes, if any other parallel plane intersects both in regions of equal area, no matter where it's taken from, well then the solids have the same volume. Now, that's clearly true here. These cylinders are built out of stacks of Vsauce stickers, 100 in each stack, so their volumes are the same. If I skew one of them, like this, its shape will change, but its volume hasn't. It still contains the same amount of stuff. I haven't added or subtracted stickers. And Cavalieri's principle ensures that they still have the same volume, because any cross section taken from down here, up here, in the middle, anywhere will always give us a region of the same area as the other, because those regions are always equal area circles. Now, let's apply Cavalieri's principle to napkin rings. We can see that two napkin rings with similar heights have identical volumes by showing that when cut by a plane, the area of one's cross section always equals the area of the other's. Now, to do this, notice that the area of the sphere's cross section minus the area of the cylinder's cross section gives us the area of the napkin ring's cross section. Depending on where we slice the napkin ring, the cross sections will have different areas, but they will always be the same as each other. Let's calculate the areas of these blue rings. First of all, let's call the height of the napkin ring H and the radius of the sphere they're cut from capital R. Alright, perfect. Now, a cross section of a sphere like this and a cross section of a cylinder like this are both circles, so their areas can be determined by using pi times the radius squared. So if we want to find the area of the sphere's cross section and subtract the area of the cylinder's cross section, draw a little picture of a cylinder here, all we need to do is take pi, multiply it by the radius of the sphere cross section, square that, and then subtract pi times the radius of the cylinder squared. But what are their radii? Well, if this is the center of the sphere, we can draw a line straight up to the corner of the cylinder, down the side of the cylinder, and then connect to form a right triangle. The Pythagorean Theorem will really help us here. It tells us that the length of one side squared plus the length of the other side squared equals the length of the hypotenuse squared. Now, this distance right here, this side of the triangle is what we want. It's the radius of the cylinder. So we'll call this the little r, radius of the cylinder. Beautiful little picture there. So the radius of the cylinder squared plus this side length, which is just half the height of the cylinder, so the height of the cylinder divided by 2 squared, equals the hypotenuse squared. The hypotenuse happens to be the radius of the sphere itself, which is capital R. Perfect. Now let's solve for the radius of the cylinder, which is what we want. We'll just subtract h over 2 squared from both sides. That'll give us the radius of the cylinder squared, equaling the radius of the sphere squared minus half the height of the cylinder squared. We can take the square root of both sides so that we wind up with the radius of the cylinder, equaling the square root of the radius of the sphere minus half the height of the cylinder squared. Perfect. Okay, now let's take a look at the area of a cross-section of the sphere. Now for this, let's draw a straight line from the center out to the edge of the sphere's cross-section. And then we'll go straight down and connect back up. Hey look, another right triangle. Let's call this height y. And notice that this distance now, the side of the triangle down here, is actually the radius of the circle cross-section up here. They're both equal. So we want to solve for this, the radius of the circle that is the sphere's cross-section. Okay, so we know that the radius of the sphere's cross-section squared plus this distance squared, which is y, equals the hypotenuse squared. Well what do you know, the hypotenuse is the radius of the sphere again, capital R. Okay, let's subtract y squared from both sides. The radius of the sphere's cross-section squared equals the radius of the sphere squared minus y squared. We'll take the square root of both sides and end up learning that the radius of the sphere's cross-section equals the square root of the radius of the sphere squared minus y squared. Why is the height that this cross-section is taken from above the equator? The higher up we take these cross-sections of the sphere, the smaller their radii will be. Whereas the cylinder's radius is always the same no matter where we cut from. Anyway, let's take these two radii and plug them into our formula. Okay, the area of the cross-section of the sphere is what we want first. Okay, that's just the square root of r squared minus y squared. Not too bad. Now the radius of the cylinder is the square root of r squared minus half the height of the cylinder squared. Now what you might notice is that we're taking the square root of something and then squaring it. So these actually cancel each other out. Perfect. Much more simple looking. But now let's distribute pi to the terms inside the parentheses. So pi times r squared gives us pi r squared. Pi times negative y squared gives us negative pi y squared. Then a negative pi times r squared is negative pi r squared. Negative pi times negative h over 2 squared is positive pi h over 2 squared. Great. Now we can keep simplifying but what you might notice is that we have a pi r squared and a minus pi r squared. Well that just equals 0. So these completely cancel each other out. But what we're left with are terms containing no mention of the sphere's radius. Whether the radius is large or small doesn't matter. All you need to know to find the area of the cross-section of a napkin ring is the height of the napkin ring. y of course is bounded by the height of the napkin ring. These blue areas have the same area as each other. And this will be true no matter where we cut the cross-section across the napkin ring meaning by Cavalieri's principle that both napkin rings have the same volume. Yay. With teeth. But what does this mean for you, for life and the universe? Well as we know, if you like it, you should put a ring on it. But if you like it, don't know its finger width and only want to offer it a predetermined amount of material, you should put a napkin ring on it. And as always, thanks for watching. On August 21st, 2017, there will be a total solar eclipse. The shadow of the moon will race across the contiguous United States. It's going to be incredible and a little bit scary I'm sure. I will be viewing it from Oregon with my friends at Atlas Obscura. I can't wait. But keep your eyes safe. If you want to view the eclipse, you have to have special eye protection. The Curiosity Box comes with such glasses. These block 99.999% of visible light. That's what it takes to be able to look right at the sun. That's actually what I love about these glasses. If there's no eclipse going on, you can still just look at the sun. Notice that it's a ball. Maybe imagine what kind of napkin ring you'd like to make it into. The current Curiosity Box is my favorite. The one that you'll get if you subscribe right now comes with all kinds of cool stuff. It comes with a poster showing that all the planets and Pluto can fit between the Earth and the moon. It also comes with science gadgets like these levitating magnetic rings. Ooh, pretty cool. Also, a portion of all proceeds go to Alzheimer's Research. So it's good for your brain and everyone else's brain. Check it out. I hope to see you at Brain Candy Live.

Classical mechanics is great. If you know the state of a system, say the position and velocity of a particle, then you can use an equation, Newton's second law, to calculate what that particle will do in the future. In quantum mechanics, if you know the quantum state of a particle, that is its wave function, you can use the Schrödinger equation to calculate what that particle will do in the future. Usually, it spreads out over time as it is doing here. Note, to make this animation, we really solved the Schrödinger equation. So, there's a beautiful symmetry here. If you know the initial state, you can use an equation to evolve that state smoothly and continuously into the future. The problem is, in quantum mechanics, we never actually observe the wave function like this. Instead, when we measure it, we find the particle at a single point in space. So, how are we to reconcile the spread-out wave function evolving smoothly under the Schrödinger equation with this point-like particle detection? Now, I think it's understandable that when the founders of quantum theory approached this problem, they considered the measurement more real than the wave function. After all, the measurement was something we had actually observed, and it matches our experience of a world of matter particles. It was harder to say what the wave function was exactly. Schrödinger formulated his wave equation because scientists, notably de Broglie, suspected that matter has wave-like properties. But it took a third physicist, Max Born, to propose how we should interpret the wave function. At each point in space, the wave function has a complex amplitude, essentially just a real number plus an imaginary number. Max Born suggested if you take that amplitude and square it, you get the probability of finding the particle there. The fact that you have to square the amplitude actually appears as a last-minute footnote in Born's paper. But that is how probability was introduced into the core of our picture of reality. That's a pretty big philosophical leap. I mean, no longer is the universe deterministic. This made a lot of scientists, especially Einstein, uncomfortable. But the Born rule, as it is now called, remains at the heart of quantum mechanics because it is spectacularly successful at predicting the outcomes of experiments. So the way quantum mechanics came to be understood, and the way I learned it, is that there are two sets of rules. When you're not looking, the wave function simply evolves according to the Schrödinger equation. But when you are looking, when you make a measurement, the wave function collapses suddenly and irreversibly. And the probability of measuring any particular outcome is given by the amplitude of the wave function associated with that outcome squared. Now, Schrödinger himself hated this formulation, which is actually why he invented the famous Schrödinger's cat thought experiment. Put a cat in a box with a radioactive atom. Add a radiation detector that triggers the release of poisonous cyanide gas. Now, although it was only meant as a thought experiment, Schrödinger helpfully notes this device must be secured against direct interference by the cat. Anyway, the whole point of the experiment is to magnify the state of the atom up to the state of something macroscopic and tangible. He could have picked anything. It didn't have to be alive. But Schrödinger selected a cat. If the atom decays, the detector detects radiation, releases the poison, and the cat dies. If the atom doesn't decay, the detector doesn't detect radiation, poison is not released, and the cat remains alive. Since the state of the cat and detector apparatus are directly tied to the state of the atom, we say they are entangled. Where things get weird is that according to quantum mechanics, the state of the atom does not have to be either decayed or not decayed. Generally, it's in a superposition of both, decayed and not decayed at the same time, assuming no measurements have been made. This superposition state of the atom gets entangled with the detector and then the cat. So after some time, the wavefunction of everything inside the box is in a superposition of the atom has not decayed, poison not released, cat alive state, and the atom has decayed, poison released, cat dead state. So according to quantum mechanics, the cat really is both alive and dead at the same time. Only when we open the box and make a measurement does the wavefunction collapse, and the cat actually becomes either dead or alive. These days, Schrödinger's cat is often used as a way to show how weird quantum mechanics is. But that wasn't Schrödinger's point. He wanted to show that quantum mechanics, as formulated, was wrong. So taking up Schrödinger's argument in this video, I want to show that there is a better way to think about Schrödinger's cat. In fact, a better way to think about quantum mechanics entirely, that I'd argue is more logical and consistent. To get there, we have to examine the three essential components of Schrödinger's cat. Superposition, entanglement, and measurement, to see if any of them is flawed. Superposition is the idea that quantum objects can be in two different states at the same time. This seems like a crazy idea and something we'd never observe, but we do indirectly with the double slit experiment. Fire individual electrons through two slits at a screen, and the pattern you see is not just the sum of electrons going separately through one slit and the other slit. It is an interference pattern. We are forced to conclude that a single electron somehow goes through one slit and the other slit simultaneously. This is superposition. Of course, it's easy to understand superposition with waves. They are spread out in space. And it's clear how the peak of a wave from one slit cancels with the trough of the wave from another slit to produce the interference pattern. And luckily we know that when we're not looking, electrons are represented by a wave, the wave function. The double slit experiment then is concrete evidence that this wave enables individual electrons to pass through both slits at the same time. So superposition is on solid ground. The next concept is entanglement. Consider two electrons fired toward each other with equal and opposite velocities. We know they will scatter off each other, but we don't know exactly how. Their trajectories are given by spread out wave functions that only give us probabilities. But as soon as we measure the momentum of one of the electrons, we immediately know the momentum of the other one. It must be equal and opposite, otherwise conservation of momentum would be violated. Now, this may seem obvious, but consider that before the measurement, the momentum of each electron was in a superposition of states. Measuring one instantaneously collapsed the wave function of the other. And this would be true even if those electrons were light years apart. These electrons are entangled. What's really going on here is that after interacting, the electrons do not have separate wave functions at all. They are described by a single wave function, and this is what it means to be entangled. This explains why measuring one immediately affects the state of the other one, because the single wave function has collapsed. In fact, if we were being rigorous, we'd have to say that there is only one wave function, the wave function of the entire universe, which includes absolutely everything. But in the case of isolated, unentangled quantum particles, we can reasonably talk about their individual wave functions. And then once they interact with something else, entanglement is the result. So what we've seen is superposition is really the same thing as describing systems with waves. And entanglement means that after particles interact, they are described by a single wave function. These are fundamental parts of quantum theory, describing systems with wave functions that evolve according to the Schrodinger equation, which leaves only measurement. Remember, the measurement postulate was added as a second set of rules to connect the mathematics of quantum mechanics to what we actually observe. But doesn't it seem weird that there should be one rule for how systems evolve when we're not looking, and a different rule for when we are? When you boil it down, measurement is just the interaction of one quantum system, electrons and photons, with another quantum system. And we know exactly how to deal with that. We simply evolve their wave functions according to the Schrodinger equation. So what if we throw out all the rules associated with measurement? Well then, in the Schrodinger's cat thought experiment, the radioactive atom in a superposition of decayed and not decayed gets entangled with the detector and in turn the cat. Now remember, we are also made of electrons and atoms which obey the laws of quantum mechanics, so we are quantum mechanical too. So when we open the box, there is no measurement, no wave function collapse. We simply get entangled with the state of everything inside the box. So we see the cat alive, and we see the cat dead. Now how is that possible? I'm guessing you've never seen both an alive and dead cat before. But the solution is, it's because the you that saw the cat alive and the you that saw it dead actually inhabit separate worlds. By that I mean, they exist in their own complete realities and those realities will never interact. But where did these separate worlds come from? Well, something I haven't mentioned yet are all the particles of the environment, the air molecules, photons, everything that we are not keeping track of. If a quantum object in a superposition gets entangled with the environment, it is said to undergo environmental decoherence. This branches the wave function of the universe, essentially splitting the universe into two slightly different copies. So a more realistic account of Schrodinger's cat goes like this. The radioactive atom evolves from 100% not decayed into a quantum superposition of decayed and not decayed. The detector becomes entangled with this superposition state of the atom. But the detector is being bombarded by all these air molecules and photons in the box, which would bounce off differently if it is detected radiation than if it hasn't. So almost immediately, the detector becomes entangled with the state of the environment. It decoheres, branching the wave function in two. At that moment, you are split into two identical copies, one entangled with each outcome of the experiment. You continue to be identical until you open the box, but in this case, the cat actually is alive or dead. You were just finding out by opening the box. What we are unaware of is that the other outcome also happened, just as someone who is not you anymore. I mean, both observers came from you, but they are no longer you and they are no longer identical to each other. This interpretation of quantum mechanics is called many worlds, and it was formulated by Hugh Everett. And if it's true, the branching of the wave function is happening all the time, so frequently in fact that the rate may well be infinite. Creating infinite subtly different worlds all the time may sound implausible, to put it mildly, but consider that all those worlds are naturally part of the mathematics of quantum mechanics. Many worlds just takes them seriously. To get rid of them requires something like the collapse of the wave function. And the point is our experience of reality would be the same in the many worlds picture as it is if the wave function collapses. But the formalism is so much cleaner and more elegant, all we have are wave functions that evolve under the Schrodinger equation. The implication is that the founders of quantum theory may have got it exactly backwards. The wave function is the complete picture of reality, and our measurement is just a tiny fraction of it, the part we become entangled with when we interact with a quantum object in a superposition. The universe also goes back to being deterministic. Every outcome happens 100% of the time. It only doesn't look that way to us because we only experience our tiny sliver of the multiverse. Now, I imagine that a lot of you have questions and possibly objections to this, so I went to the expert. Hey, how are you? Come on in. Okay, so I wanted to make this video about many worlds, but I was concerned I was going to screw it up. So I've come here to meet Caltech professor Sean Carroll, who has literally written the book on many worlds. Here's the book, Something Deeply Hidden, available wherever books are available. Let's ask probably the common sort of YouTube questions, the arguments against this. Yes. Maybe how many worlds are there? The first one is energy conservation. How is energy conserved is completely clear in the math. The energy of the whole wave function is 100% super duper conserved, but there's a difference between the energy of the whole wave function and the energy that people in each branch perceive. So what you should think of is not duplicating the whole universe, but taking a certain amount of universe and sort of subdividing it, slicing it into two pieces. The pieces look identical from the inside, except that one has spin up and one has spin down or something like that, but they're really contributing less than the original to the total energy of everything. Let's ask the question about how many worlds there are. How frequently are they branching? Right. We have no idea. There's a short answer to this. I think it's embarrassing that we don't have any idea. It's certainly often, it's certainly a lot, right? The universe branches whenever a quantum system in superposition becomes entangled with its environment. So you have atomic nuclei in your body that are radioactive. They decay. 5,000 times a second there's a radioactive decay in your body. Every one of those either decays or doesn't. You can think of it as a superposition. Once it decays, it sort of interacts with what's around it, becomes entangled, and the universe branches. It's wave function, right? So branching is happening many, many times a second just because a radioactive decays in your body. Now, is it happening infinitely often? We don't know, because we don't know whether the total number of possible branches is infinitely big or finite. It's jihumongous by any stretch. There's plenty of room for all these branches to exist. And it might very well be finite, but the details hinge on things we don't understand about quantum gravity and cosmology and the theory of everything and all that stuff. So it's a big number, but we don't know how big. Let's deal with the misconception that many worlds means everything that could possibly happen happens. Yeah. That's not true. Many worlds means the wave function obeys the Schrodinger equation. That's what it means. The Schrodinger equation predicts many things could potentially happen, but not everything. So, for example, an electron will never convert into a proton. It would violate conservation of mass, conservation of charge, all these things. Things in the Schrodinger equation give zero probability to ever happening. What about you becoming president? Yes. That could happen. There is a world in which you're president? There is a world, well, to be super duper clear, it would not be me who is president. It would be a version of me. Once the branching happens, those are two separate people now. But there is a version of you who is currently president. Yes, that's right. And who is tweeting. It's a very low amplitude world. It's a very small probability, but it's there, yes. I mean, I think this is the way in which it feels more complicated than, or it feels more ridiculous than Copenhagen, because Copenhagen is like, there's just one world, this is it. That's right. And it's what you experience. But look, the universe, the good old universe, forget about quantum mechanics, okay, just like the cosmological universe where we see all the galaxies and everything. We don't see the whole universe. We see a finite amount of it because light moves at the speed of light. So there's a place beyond which we can't see. The universe could be infinitely big. We don't know. It's certainly very plausible the universe is infinitely big. It's plausible that everywhere in the universe looks more or less like what we see with galaxies and stars and the whole bit. If that's true, there's an infinite number of copies of people exactly like you. Some of them are presidents. Some of them are winning NBA championships. Some of them are supermodels, whatever. That's just because there's a lot of different shuffling around of the atoms, okay. It has nothing to do with quantum mechanics or weirdness. Does that bother you? Does that like rub you the wrong way? Kind of. I think maybe it should. But I agree it's less weird than the quantum idea. I think in both cases it's because human beings, there's some cognitive bias. I don't know what it's called, but there's a cognitive bias that says the only probabilities for anything are 0%, 50%, or 100%. When I tell you something can happen but the probability is really, really, really, really, really, really, really, really low, people are like, but it can happen. Let me focus on that possibility that it happens. I'm like, no, don't do that. It's just not sufficiently probable that it's worth worrying about in any way. When the world branches here, does it branch instantly far away? The answer is it's up to you. This is the annoying part of the answer. I can write down a description in which the branching happens instantly throughout all of space. I use that description to make predictions about what people will see. All those predictions come out 100% completely true. I can write an alternative description in which the branching sort of spreads out at the speed of light. I make a different set of predictions, but guess what? They're exactly the same predictions. There's no difference between what those two pictures actually predict. What this is reflecting is God doesn't know about branches. There's the wave function of the universe. That's all that really exists. Breaking the wave function of the universe into different pieces that you and I call branches or worlds is very convenient for us human beings. But that's all it is. It's not built into the fabric of reality itself. It's exactly like the air in this room. Rather than listing the position and velocity of every single air molecule, I just tell you the temperature and the pressure and things like that. That's a convenient description for us human beings. It's not the full description of the reality. And branches are exactly the same way. So if you get annoyed that there's two different ways of describing the branching, you have to remember that the whole idea of branching is just a human convenience.

I've got some chalk right there, that's fine. So the video shows two ladders that are dropped and they're falling together. A and B, I put them backwards because I have no idea why I did that. And one of the ladders just keeps falling and the other one hits a table. So the bottom part starts hitting a table and the question is which one's going to hit the... which one's going to fall faster, which one's going to have a greater acceleration. So let's look at a free falling ladder that does not hit a table. If I take any particular rung on that ladder, the rungs are tilted. Did I say that? That is important, the rungs are tilted. If I take any particular rung, there's a gravitational force pulling it down, a value mg. And so since there's a downward gravitational force, this will accelerate downward at negative 9.8 ms². This one also has a gravitational force and it also accelerates downward at negative 9.8 ms². So since they're all accelerating the same, there's no tension in these strings. Strings are a force of constraint. They apply a force only if the things try to get further apart than the set length. But they don't because they have the same acceleration. Okay, so this falls at negative 9.8 ms² down. That's acceleration. Okay, now what about the case where it hits the table? Something amazing happens. Well, I mean it's not amazing. It's kind of surprising. So because the rung is tilted, one side of the rung hits the table before the other side. So that's going to exert an upwards force. Now, force is due to things. They change the momentum of an object and they change the angular momentum of an object. So if you apply a force at some particular point, it's going to change its rotational motion. So this is going to want to rotate and when it rotates, now this side of the rung is going to want to be further away from this than that set length and it will pull on the string. So this will have a tension because this hits and it wants to rotate up and that wants to rotate down above the center mass. If this rotates down and pulls on that, then this is going to have two forces on it. The downward gravitational force and a force from the tension and that's going to cause a tension in these ropes, tension in those ropes, tension all the way up. So every time it hits, it gets a little boost. Now, but what about the other side? The other side hits too. Yes, the other side hits, but by that time it's too late, right? The whole little bottom rung thing is already on the ground so it doesn't matter. Now I want to model this in Python. I haven't done that yet and I don't know that it will work, but I want to make it work. So, okay, so I also have this. I made a little physical model. You know, you don't really understand something unless you can model it. And so here's a physical model. It's not going to work the same, but you can imagine when this hits the table, it's going to rotate up and you'll notice this becomes slack. And that becomes tight and that's actually going to pull it down. That's how it happens. This comes down, pulls up, this pulls down and the whole rung speeds up a little bit. It's a great problem. Really it is. It's ingenious, but you've got to look. Why are those rungs tilted, right? That has to have something to do with it. And then you can kind of come up with this idea. And I could be wrong. Who knows? I've been wrong before. Plenty of times. You should watch that video though, and I'm sure he'll post a solution.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 674\n","\n","Link  311 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/lotbZQ55SgU\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/lotbZQ55SgU\n","[youtube] lotbZQ55SgU: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] lotbZQ55SgU: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 6.07MiB in 01:54\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Okay, so we're going for a ride around the pyramids. The Great Pyramid was the tallest man-made structure for nearly 4,000 years, only surpassed by a large margin by the Eiffel Tower in 1889. What makes the pyramids even more impressive is that these structures were built over 4,500 years ago. When Egyptians didn't have wheels or steel, the only metal available was copper and copper alloys. It took about 2 million stones to build that pyramid. Well, I call them stones, giant rocks. Somewhere between 1.5 and 3 tons each. Pyramids took about 20 to 30 years to make. It's a long time, but if you think about the number of stones, a couple million stones in every pyramid, you'd have to be laying a stone roughly once every three minutes. If you consider a regular work day like a 10 hour, 12 hour work day. Nobody knows how they built it, it's still secret. But a lot of people, they try to do the best to give you some information about how they did it. But we must say it's secret. They did and they take the secret from them. Nobody knows. No plans survived to show us how the pyramids were built. And perhaps it's not surprising that this is the subject of countless conspiracy theories involving aliens, time travel, or lost technologies. But there is a less far-fetched myth, which has become widely accepted, that the pyramids were built by slaves. But recent discoveries suggest the pyramid builders were not slaves at all. They were skilled workers. Well preserved tombs near the pyramids suggest that their hard labor and sacrifice were rewarded. If these workers had been slaves, they would not have received such honorable burials. But how did they actually manage to build the pyramids? One of the things I find really interesting is that the Egyptians didn't know about wheels. So they didn't really even use rollers as far as we can tell. I mean these rocks would have been carted across the desert on sleds. There's a famous diagram of this giant statue being pulled by 172 men. And that statue would have weighed somewhere on the order of 68 tons or something. This would normally create a lot of friction, but the sand was wetted in front of the sled. Experiments show this would reduce the pulling force required by half. The internal stones of this pyramid are all limestone, which is a bit softer and easier to work. You can imagine them working it with those copper chisels that they had. Some of these blocks may have been actually sawed through using copper saws. Now you wouldn't think that copper could really cut rock, but if you put an abrasive in there like a sand, you could actually wear away the stone. Probably be a very difficult and labor intensive job. Something that you don't really think about is that when you build a pyramid, you need to build it on level ground. You can actually see there how they had to level out that ground. Well it's speculated that when the Nile flooded, they put the flood water into a channel and see where the high parts were. So the inside was made of this limestone. The outside of this pyramid was actually made of granite. Much harder stone. I'm at the granite quarry in Aswan, where they would have quarried the stones that were used in the pyramids at Giza. Now that is an incredible feat because this is nearly a thousand kilometers away from Giza. And when the Nile flooded, water would come right through here so that they could move all the stones quarried here, this granite. They could move this back up to Giza and use it on the pyramids. These would have had to have been floated down on rafts. Now quarrying this would have been really hard. Granite is one of the hardest rocks because it contains quartz. And quartz on the hardness scale is about a seven where diamond is a ten. So how would you dig a massive trench like that? Basically the technique was just to smash the Dolarite rock into the granite over and over and over again. They would make about five millimeters progress per hour. So there is no clear account of how the pyramids were actually built. But the best guess is that ramps were used. And in fact some ramps have been found on incomplete pyramids. But you can't build just a straight ramp, a long straight ramp and keep putting the rocks up. I mean the problem with that is the ramp actually ends up taking up more material than the pyramid itself. I think a ramp which sort of wraps around the pyramids is probably the most likely thing. The top third of the height of the pyramid actually only accounts for about four percent of all the material in the pyramid. That's why it's suspected that levers were actually used to finish off the pyramid, to do the top levels. Now the pyramids have clearly weathered but in the past they would have been a brighter white because they would have used a white limestone to cover the whole face of that pyramid. And then the very top may have been covered with electrum which is a mixture of gold and silver so if you can imagine that would be a pretty spectacular sight. The reason these pyramids are shaped this way is so they represent sun rays. Imagine what that would have looked like when it was first built with a shiny metallic top and smooth white finish on all of those sides. I think that would have been a sight to behold.

A hole that means we will never know everything with certainty. There will always be true statements that cannot be proven. Now, no one knows what those statements are exactly, but they could be something like the twin-prime conjecture. Twin primes are prime numbers that are separated by just one number, like 11 and 13, or 17 and 19. As you go up the number line, primes occur less frequently, and twin primes are rarer still. But the twin-prime conjecture is that there are infinitely many twin primes. You never run out. As of right now, no one has proven this conjecture true or false. But the crazy thing is this. We may never know. Because what has been proven is that in any system of mathematics where you can do basic arithmetic, there will always be true statements that are impossible to prove. That is life. Specifically, this is the game of life created in 1970 by mathematician John Conway. Sadly, he passed away in 2020 from COVID-19. Conway's game of life is played on an infinite grid of square cells, each of which is either live or dead, and there are only two rules. One, any dead cell with exactly three neighbors comes to life, and two, any living cell with less than two or more than three neighbors dies. Once you've set up the initial arrangement of cells, the two rules are applied to create the next generation, and then the one after that, and the one after that, and so on. It's totally automatic. Conway called it a zero-player game. But even though the rules are simple, the game itself can generate a wide variety of behavior. Some patterns are stable once they arise, they never change. Others oscillate back and forth in a loop. A few can travel across the grid forever, like this glider here. Many patterns just fizzle out. But a few keep growing forever. They keep generating new cells. Now you would think that given the simple rules of the game, you could just look at any pattern and determine what will happen to it. Will it eventually reach a steady state? Or will it keep growing without limit? But it turns out, this question is impossible to answer. The ultimate fate of a pattern in Conway's game of life is undecidable, meaning there is no possible algorithm that is guaranteed to answer the question in a finite amount of time. You could always just try running the pattern and see what happens. The rules of the game are a kind of algorithm after all. But that's not guaranteed to give you an answer either, because even if you run it for a million generations, you won't be able to say whether it'll last forever, or just 2 million generations, or a billion, or a Googleplex. Is there something special about the game of life that makes it undecidable? Nope. There are actually a huge number of systems that are undecidable, like Wang tiles, quantum physics, airline ticketing systems, and even Magic the Gathering. To understand how undecidability shows up in all of these places, we have to go back 150 years to a full blown revolt in mathematics. In 1874, Georg Cantor, a German mathematician, published a paper that launched a new branch of mathematics called set theory. A set is just a well defined collection of things. So the two shoes on your feet are a set, as are all the planetariums in the world. There's a set with nothing in it, the empty set, and a set with everything in it. Now Cantor was thinking about sets of numbers, like natural numbers, positive integers like 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on, and real numbers, which include fractions like a third, five halves, and also irrational numbers like pi, e, and the square root of 2. Basically, any number that can be represented as an infinite decimal. He wondered, are there more natural numbers? Or more real numbers between 0 and 1? The answer might seem obvious. There are an infinite number of each, so both sets should be the same size. But to check this logic, Cantor imagined writing down an infinite list, matching up each natural number on one side with a real number between 0 and 1 on the other. Now, since each real number is an infinite decimal, there is no first one, so we can just write them down in any random order. The key is to make sure we get them all with no duplicates and line them up one to one with an integer. If we can do that with none left over, well then we know that the set of natural numbers and the set of real numbers between 0 and 1 are the same size. So assume we've done that. We have a complete infinite list with each integer acting like an index number, a unique identifier for each real number on the list. Now, Cantor says, start writing down a new real number. And the way we're going to do it is by taking the first digit of the first number and adding one. And then take the second digit of the second number and again add one. Take the third digit of the third number, add one. And keep doing this all the way down the list. If the digit is a 9, just roll it back to an 8. And by the end of this process, you'll have a real number between 0 and 1. But here's the thing. This number won't appear anywhere on our list. It's different from the first number in the first decimal place, different from the second number in the second decimal place, and so on down the line. It has to be different from every number on the list by at least one digit, the number on the diagonal. That's why this is called Cantor's diagonalization proof. It shows there must be more real numbers between 0 and 1 than there are natural numbers extending out to infinity. So not all infinities are the same size. Cantor called these countable and uncountable infinities respectively. And in fact, there are many more uncountable infinities which are even larger. Now, Cantor's work was just the latest blow to mathematics. For 2,000 years, Euclid's elements were considered the bedrock of the discipline. But at the turn of the 19th century, Lobachevsky and Gauss discovered non-Euclidean geometries. And this prompted mathematicians to examine more closely the foundations of their field. And they did not like what they saw. The idea of a limit at the heart of calculus turned out to be poorly defined. And now Cantor was showing that infinity itself was much more complex than anyone had imagined. In all this upheaval, mathematics fractured and a huge debate broke out among mathematicians at the end of the 1800s. On the one side were the intuitionists who thought that Cantor's work was nonsense. They were convinced that math was a pure creation of the human mind and that infinities like Cantor's weren't real. Henri Poincaré said that later generations will regard set theory as a disease from which one has recovered. Leopold Kronecker called Cantor a scientific charlatan and a corruptor of the youth. And he worked to keep Cantor from getting a job he wanted. On the other side were the formalists. They thought that math could be put on absolutely secure logical foundations through Cantor's set theory. The informal leader of the formalists was the German mathematician David Hilbert. Hilbert was a living legend, a hugely influential mathematician who had worked in nearly every area of mathematics. He almost beat Einstein to the punch on general relativity. He developed entirely new mathematical concepts that were crucial for quantum mechanics and he knew that Cantor's work was brilliant. Hilbert was convinced that a more formal and rigorous system of mathematical proof based on set theory could solve all the issues that had cropped up in math over the last century. And most other mathematicians agreed with him. \"'No one shall expel us from the paradise that Cantor has created,' Hilbert declared. But in 1901 Bertrand Russell pointed out a serious problem in Cantor's set theory. Russell knew that if sets can contain anything, they can contain other sets, or even themselves. For example, the set of all sets must contain itself, as does the set of sets with more than five elements in them. You could even talk about the set of all sets that contain themselves. But this leads straight to a problem. What about R, the set of all sets that don't contain themselves? If R doesn't contain itself, well then it must contain itself. But if R does contain itself, then by definition it must not contain itself. So R contains itself if and only if it doesn't. Russell had found another paradox of self-reference. And he later explained his paradox using a hairy analogy. Let's say there's a village populated entirely by grown men with a strange law against beards. Specifically the law states that the village barber must shave all and only those men of the village who do not shave themselves. But the barber himself lives in the village too, of course, and he's a man. So who shaves him? If he doesn't shave himself, then the barber has to shave him. But the barber can't shave himself, because the barber doesn't shave anyone who shaves themselves. So the barber must shave himself if and only if he doesn't shave himself. It's a contradiction. The intuitionists rejoiced at Russell's paradox, thinking it had proven set theory hopelessly flawed. But Zermelo and other mathematicians from Hilbert School solved the problem by restricting the concept of a set. So the collection of all sets, for example, is not a set anymore. And neither is the collection of all sets which don't contain themselves. This eliminated the paradoxes that come with self-reference. Hilbert and the formalists lived to fight another day, but self-reference refused to die quite that easily. Fast forward to the 1960s, and mathematician Hao Wang was looking at square tiles with different colors on each side, like these. The rules were that touching edges must be the same color, and you can't rotate or reflect tiles, only slide them around. The question was, if you're given an arbitrary set of these tiles, can you tell if they will tile the plane? That is, will they connect up with no gaps all the way out to infinity? It turns out, you can't tell for an arbitrary set of tiles whether they will tile the plane or not. The problem is undecidable. Just like the fate of a pattern in Conway's Game of Life. In fact, it's exactly the same problem. And that problem, ultimately, comes from self-reference, as Hilbert and the formalists were about to discover. Hilbert wanted to secure the foundations of mathematics by developing a new system for mathematical proofs. Systems of proof were an old idea going back to the ancient Greeks. A system of proof starts with axioms, basic statements that are assumed to be true, like a straight line can be drawn between any two points. Methods are then constructed from those axioms using rules of inference, methods for using existing statements to derive new statements. And these are chosen to preserve truth. The existing statements are true, then so are the new ones. Hilbert wanted a formal system of proof, a symbolic logical language with a rigid set of manipulation rules for those symbols. Logical and mathematical statements could then be translated into this system. If you drop a book, then it will fall, would be A then B. And no human is immortal, would be expressed like this. Hilbert and the formalists wanted to express the axioms of mathematics as symbolic statements in a formal system, and set up the rules of inference as the system's rules for symbol manipulation. So Russell, along with Alfred North Whitehead, developed a formal system like this in their three-volume Principia Mathematica, published in 1913. Principia Mathematica is vast, a total of nearly 2,000 pages of dense mathematical notation. It takes 762 pages just to get to a complete proof that 1 plus 1 equals 2, at which point Russell and Whitehead dryly note, the above proposition is occasionally useful. The authors had originally planned a fourth volume, but unsurprisingly, they were too worn out to complete it. So yes, the notation is dense and exhausting, but it is also exact, unlike ordinary languages. It leaves no room for errors or fuzzy logic to creep in. And most importantly, it allows you to prove properties of the formal system itself. There were three big questions that Hilbert wanted answered about mathematics. Number one, is math complete? Meaning is there a way to prove every true statement? Does every true statement have a proof? Number two, is mathematics consistent? Meaning is it free of contradictions? I mean, if you can simultaneously prove A and not A, then that's a real problem, because you can prove anything at all. And number three, is math decidable? Meaning is there an algorithm that can always determine whether a statement follows from the axioms? Now Hilbert was convinced that the answers to all three of these questions was yes. At a major conference in 1930, Hilbert gave a fiery speech about these questions. He ended it with a line that summed up his formalist dream. In opposition to the foolish ignorabimus, which means we will not know, our slogan shall be we must know, we will know. These words are literally on his grave. But by the time Hilbert gave this speech, his dream was already crumbling. Just the day before, at a small meeting at the same conference, a 24-year-old logician named Kurt Gödel explained that he had found the answer to the first of Hilbert's three big questions about completeness, and the answer was no. A complete formal system of mathematics was impossible. The only person who paid much attention was John von Neumann, one of Hilbert's former students who pulled Gödel aside to ask a few questions. But the next year, Gödel published a proof of his incompleteness theorem, and this time everyone, including Hilbert, took notice. This is how Gödel's proof works. Gödel wanted to use logic and mathematics to answer questions about the very system of logic and mathematics. And so he took all these basic symbols of a mathematical system, and then he gave each one a number. This is known as the symbol's Gödel number. So the symbol for not gets the number 1, or has the Gödel number 2, if then is Gödel number 3. Now, if you're expressing all of these symbols with numbers, then what do you do about the numbers themselves? Well, 0 gets its own Gödel number 6, and if you want to write a 1, you just put this successor symbol next to it. The immediate successor of 0 is 1. And if you want to write 2, then you have to write SS0, and that represents 2, and so on. So you could represent any positive integer this way. Granted, it is cumbersome, but it works. And that is the point of this system. So now that we have Gödel numbers for all of the basic symbols and all of the numbers we might want to use, we can start to write equations. Like we could write 0 equals 0. So these symbols have the Gödel numbers 6, 5, 6. And we can actually create a new card that represents this equation, 0 equals 0. And the way we do it is we take the prime numbers, starting at 2, and we raise each one to the power of the Gödel number of the symbol in our equation. So we have 2 to the power of 6 times 3 to the power of 5 times 5 to the power of 6 equals 243 million. So 243 million is the Gödel number of the whole equation 0 equals 0. We can write down Gödel numbers for any set of symbols that you can imagine. So really, this is an infinite deck of cards, where any set of symbols that you want to write down in a sequence, you can represent with a unique Gödel number. And the beauty of this Gödel number is you can do a prime factorization of it, and you can work out exactly what symbols made up this card. So in this whole pack of cards, there are going to be true statements, and there are going to be false statements. So how do you prove that something is true? Well, you need to go to the axioms. The axioms also have their own Gödel numbers, which are formed in the same way. So here's an axiom which says, not the successor of any number x equals 0. Which makes sense, because in this system, there are no negative numbers, and so the successor of any number cannot be 0. So we can put down this axiom, and then we can substitute in 0 for x, saying that 1 does not equal 0. And we've created a proof. This is the simplest proof I can think of that shows that 1 does not equal 0. Now this card, for the proof of 1 does not equal 0, gets its own Gödel number. And the way we calculate this Gödel number is just as before, we take the prime numbers, and we raise 2 to the power of the axiom, times 3 to the power of 1 does not equal 0. And we get a tremendously large number. It would have 73 million digits if you calculated it all out. So I've just left it here in exponential notation. As you can see, these numbers get very large, and so you might want to start just calling them by letters. So we could say this one is Gödel number A, this is Gödel number B, Gödel number C, and so on. Gödel goes to all this trouble to find this card, which says there is no proof for the statement with Gödel number G. The trick is that the Gödel number of this card is G. So what this statement is really saying is this card is unprovable. There is no proof anywhere in our infinite deck for this card. Now think about it, if it's false and there is a proof, then what you have just proven is there is no proof. So you're stuck with a contradiction. That would mean the mathematical system is inconsistent. The other alternative is that this card is true. There is no proof for the statement with Gödel number G, but that means this mathematical system has true statements in it that have no proof. So your mathematical system is incomplete. And that is Gödel's incompleteness theorem. This is how he shows that any basic mathematical system that can do fundamental arithmetic will always have statements within it which are true, but which have no proof. There's a line in the TV show The Office that echoes the self-referential paradox of Gödel's proof. Jim is my enemy, but it turns out that Jim is also his own worst enemy. And the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So Jim is actually my friend. But because he is his own worst enemy, the enemy of my friend is my enemy, so actually Jim is my enemy. But... Gödel's incompleteness theorem means that truth and provability are not at all the same thing. Hilbert was wrong. There will always be true statements about mathematics that just cannot be proven. Now, Hilbert could console himself with the hope that at least we could still prove maths consistent, that is, free of contradictions. But then Gödel published his second incompleteness theorem in which he showed that any consistent formal system of math cannot prove its own consistency. So taken together, Gödel's two incompleteness theorems say that the best you can hope for is a consistent yet incomplete system of math. But a system like that cannot prove its own consistency. So some contradiction could always crop up in the future, revealing that the system you'd been working with had been inconsistent the whole time. And that leaves only the third and final big question from Hilbert. Is mathematics decidable? That is, is there an algorithm that can always determine whether a statement follows from the axioms? And in 1936, Alan Turing found a way to settle this question. But to do it, he had to invent the modern computer. In his time, computers weren't machines. They were people, often women who carried out long and tedious calculations. Turing imagined an entirely mechanical computer. He wanted it to be powerful enough to perform any computation imaginable, but simple enough that you could reason through its operation. So he came up with a machine that takes as input an infinitely long tape of square cells, each containing a zero or a one. The machine has a read-write head that can read one digit at a time. And then it can perform one of only a few tasks. Overwrite a new value. Move left. Move right. Or simply, halt. Halting means the program has run to completion. The program consists of a set of internal instructions. You can think of it like a flowchart that tells the machine what to do based on the digit it reads and its internal state. You could imagine exporting these instructions to any other Turing machine, which would then perform in exactly the same way as the first. Although this sounds simple, a Turing machine's arbitrarily large memory and program mean it can execute any computable algorithm if given enough time. From addition and subtraction to the entire YouTube algorithm, it can do anything a modern computer can. That's what made the Turing machine so useful in answering Hilbert's question on decidability. When a Turing machine halts, the program has finished running and the tape is the output. But sometimes a Turing machine never halts. Maybe it gets stuck in an infinite loop. Is it possible to tell beforehand if a program will halt or not on a particular input? Turing realized this halting problem was very similar to the decidability problem. If you could find a way to figure out if a Turing machine would halt, then it would also be possible to decide if a statement followed from the axioms. For example, you could solve the twin-prime conjecture by writing a Turing machine program that starts with the axioms and constructs all theorems that can be produced in one step using the rules of inference. Then it constructs all theorems that can be produced in one step from those, and so on. Each time it generates a new theorem, it checks if it's the twin-prime conjecture. And if it is, it halts. If not, it never halts. So if you could solve the halting problem, you could solve the twin-prime conjecture and all sorts of other unsolved questions. So Turing said, let's assume we can make a machine H that can determine whether any Turing machine will halt or not on a particular input. You insert the program and its input, and H simulates what will happen, printing out either halts or never halts. For now, we don't worry about how H works. We just know that it always works. It always gives you the right answer. Now, we can modify the H machine by adding additional components. One, if it receives the output, halts, immediately goes into an infinite loop. Another, if it receives never halts, then it immediately halts. We can call this entire new machine H+, and we can export the program for that entire machine. Now, what happens if we give this machine its own code, both as program and input? Well, now, H is simulating what H+, given its own input. Essentially, H has to determine the behavior of a machine that it itself is a part of, in this exact circumstance. If H concludes that H+, never halts, well, this makes H+, immediately halt. If H thinks H+, will halt, then that necessarily forces H+, to loop. Whatever output the halting machine H gives, it turns out to be wrong. There's a contradiction. The only explanation can be that a machine like H, can't exist. There's no way to tell in general if a Turing machine will halt or not on a given input. And this means mathematics is undecidable. There is no algorithm that can always determine whether a statement is derivable from the axioms. So, something like the twin prime conjecture might be unsolvable. We might never know whether there are infinite twin primes or not. The problem of undecidability even crops up in physical systems. In quantum mechanics, one of the most important properties of a many-body system is the difference in energy between its ground state and its first excited state. This is known as the spectral gap. Some systems have a significant spectral gap, whereas others are gapless. There are a continuum of energy levels all the way down to the ground state. And this is important because at low temperatures, gapless quantum systems can undergo phase transitions while gapped systems cannot. They don't have the energy needed to overcome the spectral gap. But figuring out if a system is gapped or gapless has long been known to be a very difficult problem. Only recently, in 2015, did mathematicians prove that in general the spectral gap question is undecidable. To quote the authors, even a perfect, complete description of the microscopic interactions between a material's particles is not always enough to deduce its macroscopic properties. Now remember that Turing designed his machines to be as powerful computers as it is possible to make. To this day, the best computational systems are those that can do everything a Turing machine can. This is called Turing completeness. It turns out there are many such Turing complete systems. Although they are powerful, every Turing complete system comes with a catch, its own analog of the halting problem, some undecidable property of the system. Wang tiles are Turing complete. Their halting problem is whether or not they'll tile the plane. Complex quantum systems are Turing complete, and their halting problem is the spectral gap question. And the game of life is Turing complete. Its halting problem is literally whether or not it halts. There are many more examples of this, like airline ticketing systems, Magic the Gathering, PowerPoint slides, and Excel spreadsheets. Nearly every programming language in existence is designed to be Turing complete. But in theory we only need one programming language, because you can program anything at all using any Turing complete system. So here's a Turing machine inside the game of life. And since the game of life is itself Turing complete, it should be capable of simulating itself, and indeed it is. This is the game of life, running on the game of life. The real legacy of David Hilbert's dream is all of our modern computational devices. Kurt Gödel suffered bouts of mental instability later in life. Convinced that people were trying to poison him, he refused to eat. Eventually, starving himself to death. Hilbert died in 1943. His epitaph was his slogan from 1930. We must know, we will know. The truth is, we don't know. Sometimes we can't know. But in trying to find out, we can discover new things. Things that change the world. Alan Turing put his ideas about computing to practical use in World War II, leading the team at Bletchley Park that built real calculating machines to crack Nazi codes for the Allies. By one estimate, the intelligence Turing and his colleagues gathered from decrypted messages shortened the war by two to four years. After the war, Turing and John von Neumann designed the first true programmable electronic computer, ENIAC, based on Turing's designs. But Turing didn't live to see his ideas develop much further. In 1952, the British government convicted him of gross indecency upon learning he was gay. He was stripped of his security clearance and forced to take hormones. In 1954, he committed suicide. Turing changed the world. He is widely considered to be the most important founding figure in computer science. All modern computers are descended from his designs. But Turing's ideas about computability came from his concept of the Turing machine, which came from thinking about Hilbert's question, is math decidable? So Turing's code-breaking machines and indeed all modern computers stem from the weird paradoxes that arise from self-reference. There is a hole at the bottom of math. A hole that means we will never know everything with certainty. There will always be true statements that cannot be proven. You might think this realization would have driven mathematicians mad and led to the disintegration of the entire mathematical enterprise. But instead, thinking about this problem transformed the concept of infinity, changed the course of a world war, and led directly to the invention of the device you're watching this on right now. as you develop your understanding. And that's what I love about this site. I love how it guides you, not by telling you exactly, but by exposing you to increasingly sophisticated puzzles. And at the end, I feel like I've worked it out for myself, which essentially I have, through their carefully curated selection of problems and with helpful hints and explanations for when I get stuck. Now, there were a lot of things I wanted to include in this video but couldn't because it's already over half an hour long, so if you want to explore these ideas further, I'd highly recommend their courses on number theory and computer science fundamentals.

I think you promised to be really really careful. I promise I will be so incredibly careful. I will be incredibly careful with it. Okay. I promise. Alright. So it's slippery, be careful. Alright. Are you ready? I'm about to touch a 1 kilogram sphere of silicon 28 atoms. They're about 2.15 times 10 to the 25 of them. Oh! It feels absolutely incredible. Wow. That is amazing. Besides its creators, I am one of only a handful of people ever to hold this sphere. The raw material used to make it was worth 1 million euros. But now that it has been so precisely sculpted, how much is that worth? It's priceless. This you are looking at now is the roundest object in the world. How can you say for sure that it's the roundest object? I mean the earth is pretty round, isn't it? If this was the earth... If this were the earth, then the highest mountain in the lowest valley would be... About 14 meters apart. That is shocking. That is shockingly round. But why would you invest 1 million euros and thousands of man hours perfecting a pure, polished silicon sphere? Well the answer is grave. Or rather, grav, as it would have been pronounced in the original French. You see, the grav was the original name for the base unit of mass in the metric system, which became the Système Internationale d'Unité, or SI units. In 1793, a commission which included notable scientist and aristocrat Antoine Lavoisier defined the base unit of mass as the weight of a cubic decimeter of water at the melting temperature of ice. Essentially just a liter of ice water. The name grav came from the Latin gravitas, meaning weight, but it wasn't to last. It sounded too similar to the aristocratic title graph, which is the equivalent of an url or a count. And with the French Revolution in full swing, with the rallying cry of equality for all, you couldn't exactly have one unit nobler than the others. At this, Lavoisier lost his head. Literally. Not because he helped devise one of the greatest systems of measurement of all time, but because he was collecting taxes as a nobleman. So things really were grave. The new republican government believed a grav would be too big for the things they wanted to measure anyway, so they settled on a gram, which was just a thousandth of a grav. But soon they realized that a gram was too small, and so they returned to the grav. But since they couldn't call it that, they invented the kilogram, a thousand grams. And that is why, out of the seven base SI units, the kilogram is the only one to have a prefix in its name. In 1799, the kilogram definition was refined to be the mass of a liter of water at 4 degrees Celsius, the temperature at which it is densest. But water itself is obviously not the most sensible thing to use as a mass standard, so a pure platinum cylinder was created to have the same mass as the water definition. And it was declared kilogram of the archives. Now it's important to note, at this point, the kilogram is no longer tied to the mass of a volume of water. The kilogram of the archives is, by definition, the kilogram. Ninety years later, in 1889, the kilogram was upgraded to a platinum iridium alloy cylinder. Now it was much harder than the original, but was otherwise basically identical. And to this day, it remains the definition of the kilogram. It is officially called the International Prototype Kilogram, though it's affectionately known as Le Grand Que, or Big K. Oh, and it's about this big. It is the only thing in the entire universe with a mass of exactly one kilogram, because it is the kilogram. It is also the only SI unit that is still defined by a physical object. It sits under three bell jars next to six sister kilograms in a climate-controlled vault, locked by three independently controlled keys in the basement of the International Bureau of Weights and Measures on the outskirts of Paris. Now, if you were able to break into the vault and tamper with Big K, you would actually be changing the definition of the kilogram, a definition on which many of our measurements rely. And so you would throw the world into chaos. Well, no, not actually. But how would anyone ever know if the mass of Big K changed? Well, when it was first created, 40 identical replicas were also made. Well, they weren't quite identical. They had a mass which was slightly different to Big K, but those offsets were recorded. Now, these replicas were sent out to countries around the world to serve as their national standards. In 1948, the kilograms were reunited for a weigh-in, and this is when the problem started. Because even though all the cylinders were made of the same alloy and stored under virtually the same conditions, their masses had diverged over time. The mass of Big K wasn't even the same as the six sister cylinders stored with it. And to make matters worse, when they were brought together again 40 years later, their masses had further diverged, up to about 50 micrograms. That's about the weight of a fingerprint. But fingerprints were not the culprits, since the kilograms were carefully washed before their weigh-ins. So some physical process must have actually changed the mass of the cylinders. But how that exactly works remains a matter of speculation. One thing is for certain, the mass of a platinum iridium cylinder is not stable over time. And this is a big problem. You can't have a unit which changes its value. And the fallout isn't limited to measurements of mass, since of the seven base SI units, four of them depend on the mass of the kilogram. Not to mention all the derived units like newtons, joules, volts, and watts. At this point, those of you in countries that have not adopted the metric system, yes, I'm speaking to you, Liberia, Burma, and the US, you may be feeling rather smug that your base unit of mass, the AVOIR du poids pound, is no longer defined by a physical object. No, instead, it is defined as precisely 0.45359237 kilograms sucked in. So clearly, something needs to be done to eliminate the kilogram's dependence on a physical object. And this is where the silicon sphere comes in. But how exactly does that help? Here you have a physical object, and it's beautiful, but, you know, it's still a physical object. You're trying to get away from that. We're trying to get away from the physical object, but what we're doing with this particular object is counting how many atoms are in there. You can't actually count how many are in there, can you? You can't count how many are in there, but you can calculate how many are in there, because this material is silicon. There's no voids or dislocations. So this is like a perfect crystal of silicon. That's right. Not only is it pure silicon, it contains only one isotope of silicon, silicon-28. And that explains why the original material was so expensive. And why a sphere? Well, a sphere is a pretty simple object. If you know the diameter of the sphere, you can characterize the entire dimension of the object. Well, that explains why the sphere has to be the roundest object ever created. But how do you actually make something that round? We actually start with an oversized sphere. So it was about two millimeters larger in diameter. And then we just grind it progressively finer and finer using abrasive. It's actually massaging atoms. You're down at that level of trying to control the shape of an object down at the atomic level. But making the sphere is only half the battle. Then you need to accurately measure its diameter. The diameter is actually measured via a laser. So you're actually measuring having the sphere in the center of a cavity, and a laser is hitting both sides, and you're actually measuring the gap. By knowing the diameter, you can determine its volume. And since the atom spacing of silicon is known to high precision, you can then calculate how many atoms make up the sphere. This allows you to redefine Avogadro's constant. At the moment, Avogadro's constant is defined based on the kilogram. It is equal to the number of atoms in 12 grams of carbon-12. But using this approach, the number of silicon atoms in the sphere would be used to fix Avogadro's constant, which would then define the kilogram. So even if the silicon spheres were lost or damaged, it would have no effect on the definition of the kilogram, because it would be defined not by a physical object, but by a concept. You would like to see the official definition of the kilogram say, that kilogram is the mass of 2.15 times 10 to the 25 silicon 28 atoms. Yes. Is it going to happen? There's a likelihood, a high likelihood that it's going to happen. But there is another approach to redefining the kilogram, which involves fixing Planck's constant, and it's done using something called a watt balance. These two approaches are complementary. Each one provides a check on the other. And if they show good agreement, and are able to bring their uncertainties down to about 20 micrograms, they may redefine the kilogram as early as 2014. And then the kilogram finally will be an unchanging unit, no longer defined by a physical object in the basement vault of some place in Paris. Now if the kilogram was originally intended to be the mass of a liter of water at its densest temperature, then how well did we do? Well, if you look at a liter of water at nearly four degrees Celsius, it has a mass of 999.975 grams. So I guess you could look at this two ways. On the one hand, you could say the kilogram is slightly heavier than it should be. But on the other hand, 214 years ago, scientists were able to create an artifact that was correct within the margin of error of a grain of rice. Now that is truly remarkable. Now if you want to hear more about the watt balance, let me know in the comments and I will see what I can do. It does seem to be the front runner in terms of redefining the kilogram. So we will have to wait and see what happens. One last thing. I should point out that it took an international collaboration of scientists to create the silicon sphere. But don't you think that the scientists who originally conceived of silicon as an element should receive some of the credit? Well, in 1787, that was none other than Antoine Lavoisier. So he's been involved in the definition of a kilogram from start to finish, or from cradle to grave.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1862\n","\n","Link  314 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/nmgFG7PUHfo\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/nmgFG7PUHfo\n","[youtube] nmgFG7PUHfo: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] nmgFG7PUHfo: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 25.89MiB in 05:36\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  This is a video about the most important algorithm of all time, the Fast Fourier Transform, or FFT. I mean, you use it all the time, including right now to watch this video, and it's used in radar and sonar, 5G and Wi-Fi. Basically, any time a signal is processed, there's a good chance that a Fast Fourier Transform is involved. But on top of all this, the FFT was discovered by scientists trying to detect covert nuclear weapons tests. And if they had discovered it sooner, it may have put a stop to the nuclear arms race. You know, I always assumed that the nuclear arms race was inevitable, that once the US dropped atomic bombs on Hiroshima and Nagasaki, it was just unavoidable that all the other major powers would develop nukes. But maybe it wasn't, because it was clear to everyone that nuclear weapons were game-changing. The bomb dropped on Hiroshima released a thousand times more energy than the biggest conventional explosive. So other countries were rightfully concerned. At the end of the war, Canada and the UK requested a meeting to discuss what would be done about nuclear weapons. And contrary to what I expected, the US was actually open to these discussions. They realized that they wouldn't be the only nation with nukes for long. So they offered to decommission all their nuclear weapons if other nations would pledge never to make them. This was known as the Baruch Plan. And it proposed that an international body would control all radioactive materials on Earth, from mining to refining to using these materials for peaceful purposes, as in nuclear power generation. But the Soviets rejected the proposal. They saw it as just another ploy to maintain American nuclear dominance. And so the global nuclear arms race began. To develop new nuclear weapons required extensive testing. And most of it was done in remote places like the Arctic or the South Pacific Islands. The US also created a nuclear testing site in Nevada, the radioactive products of which blew across the country. So that outside of Japan, the people most adversely affected by American nuclear weapons were Americans themselves. The US soon graduated from fission weapons to thermonuclear bombs, which combined fission and fusion to release even more energy. They were as big a leap from the first atomic bombs as those devices were from conventional explosives, a thousand times again more powerful. In 1954 at Bikini Atoll in the South Pacific, the US tested a new thermonuclear design that used lithium deuteride as a fuel. And they expected the device, code name Shrimp, to release the energy equivalent of six million tons of TNT. But they were wrong. It released two and a half times that due to unanticipated reactions with lithium-7. And as a result, more radioactive material was created and it rained down over a much larger area than planned. Residents of neighboring atolls were only evacuated three days later, suffering from radiation sickness. And further east, the 23 crew of a Japanese fishing boat were caught in a flurry of radioactive white ash. And by that evening, they were suffering from acute radiation syndrome. One of the crew died from ensuing complications six months later. These events triggered public outcry against nuclear testing. The modern peace sign was designed in the 1950s by combining the semaphore letters for N and D, standing for nuclear disarmament. A number of world leaders called for a comprehensive test ban. No more testing of nuclear weapons by any state. And this call was actually taken seriously by the world's nuclear powers. They entered into negotiations at meetings with very literal names like the Conference on the Discontinuance of Nuclear Weapon Tests held in Geneva in 1958. And to show just how serious they were, they even stopped all testing during the negotiations, which is why 1959 is the only year in a long stretch when no nuclear weapons were detonated. But there was a big problem with negotiating a comprehensive test ban, which is, how do you know that the other side will hold up their end of the bargain? The US worried that the Soviets would continue testing covertly and leapfrog them technologically. And the Soviets similarly distrusted the US. So to address these concerns, they convened the Conference of Experts to study the possibility of detecting violations of a possible agreement on suspension of nuclear tests. Seriously, that was the name. I am not making this up. Now, detecting atmospheric tests was fairly straightforward. The radioactive isotopes they produce disperse in the atmosphere and can be detected thousands of kilometers away. Underwater tests produce distinctive sounds that travel efficiently around a kilometer below the surface of the ocean. These can be picked up by hydrophones. But underground tests are much harder to detect from afar because their radiation is mostly contained. And the Soviets refused to allow on-site compliance visits, which they regarded as espionage. And this is ultimately why when a test ban treaty was signed in 1963, it was only a partial ban. It banned testing underwater, in the atmosphere, and in space, places where compliance could be verified. But it didn't ban testing underground for the simple reason that it was almost impossible to verify compliance. But scientists had been trying to find a way to reliably detect underground detonations. Following the Geneva meeting, American and Soviet scientists formed a working group to discuss the issue. And their idea was to use seismometers located outside the countries where nukes were being tested to detect the faint ground vibrations caused by explosions. The problem was, how do you distinguish a nuclear test from an earthquake? Every day around the world, there are close to 300 earthquakes with a magnitude of three or greater. In addition, part of the purpose of detecting your adversary's tests is to spy on them, to know how big of an explosion they can make. But the seismometer signal depends not only on the yield of the device, but also on how deep it was buried. For a given yield, deeper explosions appear smaller. So scientists wanted a method to reliably determine whether a given signal was a bomb or an earthquake, and if it was a bomb, how big it was and how deep it was buried. They knew that all this information was contained in the seismometer signal, but it couldn't just be read off by looking at the squiggles. They needed to know how much of different frequencies were present, which meant they needed to take a Fourier transform. A Fourier transform is a way of decomposing a signal into pure sine waves, each with its own amplitude and frequency that add to make it up. This seems a bit like magic, since the sum of a set of sine waves can look arbitrarily complicated and nothing like its component parts. There are some elegant ways to understand how Fourier transforms work, shout out to the awesome video by 3Blue1Brown, but I want to take more of a brute force approach. If you want to know how much of a particular sine wave is in a signal, just multiply the signal by the sine wave at each point, and then add up the sine wave. As a simple example, say our signal is just a sine wave with a certain frequency. But pretend we don't know that, and we're trying to figure out which sine waves add to make it up. Well, if you multiply this signal by a sine wave of an arbitrary frequency, the two waves are uncorrelated. You're just as likely to find places where they have the same sine, both positive or both negative, as where they have opposite sines. And therefore, when you multiply them together, the area above the x-axis is equal to the area below the x-axis, so these areas add up to zero. Which means that frequency sine wave is not a part of your signal. And this will be true for almost all frequencies you could try, assuming you're looking over a long enough time frame. The only exception is if the frequency of the sine wave exactly matches that of the signal. Now these waves are quite similar, so their product is always positive, and so is the area under the curve. That indicates that this sine wave is part of our signal. And this trick works even if the signal is composed of a bunch of different frequencies. If the sine wave's frequency is one of the components of the signal, it will correlate with the signal producing a non-zero area. And the size of this area tells you the relative amplitude of that frequency sine wave in the signal. Repeat this process for all frequencies of sine waves, and you get the frequency spectrum. Essentially, which frequencies are present and in what proportions. Now so far, I've only talked about sine waves. But if the signal is a cosine wave, then even if you multiply it by a sine wave of the exact same frequency, the area under the curve will be zero. So for each frequency we multiply, the area under the sine wave will be zero. So for each frequency, we actually need to multiply by a sine wave and a cosine wave, and find the amplitudes for each. The ratio of these amplitudes indicates the phase of the signal. That is, how much it's shifted to the left or to the right. You can calculate these sine and cosine amplitudes separately, or you can use Euler's formula. So you only need to multiply your signal by one exponential term. Then the real part of the sum is the cosine amplitude, and the imaginary part is the sine amplitude. In the American delegation at the Geneva meeting, there was a physicist Richard Garwin and a mathematician John Tukey. They got into a debate with the Soviet delegation over which nations seismometers were superior. So Garwin simulated the responses of both countries' devices on a computer at CERN. The next day, everyone agreed there wasn't much difference. The real obstacle to detecting underground explosions wasn't the accuracy of the seismometers, it was the vast amounts of computation required to Fourier transform the seismometer signals. Here's an example seismometer signal and its Fourier transform. Thus far, I've been thinking about signals as infinite continuous waves, and when you take their Fourier transform, you get an infinite continuous frequency spectrum. But real-world signals are not like that. They are finite and made up of individual samples or data points. Even though a seismometer signal looks smooth and continuous, it doesn't record ground motion with infinite precision. There is some fundamental graininess to the data. So what you have is discrete, finite data. So you can't use the idealized Fourier transform. Instead, you have to perform something called a discrete Fourier transform. And one of the distinguishing features of a discrete Fourier transform is that the frequency spectrum is also discrete and finite. You can think of the frequencies as falling into a finite number of bins. And what determines the number and size of these bins is the number of samples in the signal and how closely spaced they are. For example, the more spaced out the samples are, the lower the maximum frequency you can measure, because the samples aren't close enough together to capture high frequency oscillations. The shorter the duration of the signal, the harder it is to tell similar frequencies apart. So this lowers the frequency resolution. The shorter the signal, the wider each frequency bin is. The lowest non-zero frequency you can effectively measure is one whose period is equal to the duration of the signal. And the higher frequency bins are just integer multiples of this frequency, so they fit two, three, four, and so on periods in the duration of the signal. The total number of frequency bins is equal to the number of samples in the signal. So if the signal is made up of eight samples, then the transform has eight frequency bins, going from zero up to seven times the fundamental frequency. So let's do an example. Say we have a signal made up of eight samples, but then the discrete Fourier transform will have eight frequency bins. The first bin corresponds to a frequency of zero. Essentially, this measures if the signal is systematically shifted off the x-axis. You can think of it as measuring the DC offset. You multiply each data point by one and add them all together. In this case, they add to zero. The second frequency bin corresponds to the frequency that fits one period in the duration of the signal. So in this case, that corresponds to one hertz. You multiply each point by a sine wave of this frequency and a cosine wave of this frequency and separately add them up. For sine, they add to zero. For cosine, they add to four. And then repeat the process for two hertz, three hertz, and so on up to seven times the frequency. So you have the discrete Fourier transform of this really simple signal. Now, this process works fine in principle, and you could use it to calculate all discrete Fourier transforms. But the problem is it requires way too many calculations. To complete one discrete Fourier transform requires multiplying n data points by n different frequency waves, so n squared complex multiplications. Now, this is doable for eight samples, but if you had, say, a million samples, that would require a million squared or one trillion calculations. At the speed of 1960s computers, that would take over three years to complete, all for a single transform. Now, a million samples is admittedly more than you would need for a single seismic event, but to analyze tens of events per day from hundreds of seismometers, it would just be far too time consuming. And that's what gave scientists the impetus to look for a better way. And the breakthrough came in 1963 at a meeting of the president's science advisory committee. President John F. Kennedy was there, as were Garwin and Tukey, the physicist and mathematician from the Geneva meeting. Although they were discussing issues of national importance, like the Apollo program and nuclear fallout shelters, the meeting was apparently pretty boring. Garwin observed Tukey doodling throughout. But what he was actually doing was working on discrete Fourier transforms. At the end of the meeting, Garwin asked Tukey what he had worked out. And he was shocked to learn that Tukey knew a way to compute discrete Fourier transforms with many fewer computations. It would mean that the calculation that would have taken over three years could be done in just 35 minutes. This has aptly become known as the fast Fourier transform. So here is how it works. Consider the example from before with eight samples. Each of those data points must be multiplied by the eight different frequency waves. Here I'm only showing cosines for simplicity. So you would expect this to require eight times eight or 64 complex multiplications. But due to the periodic nature of sinusoids, these waves of different frequencies overlap in a predictable way. For example, at the middle data point, all of the four odd frequencies have the same value. And all of the four even frequencies have the same value as well. So instead of doing eight multiplications, you only need to do two. And this sort of duplication occurs at the other data points as well. So instead of performing 64 calculations, you need only 24. Now that might seem like a small improvement, but it's the difference between a calculation that scales as n, the number of samples, squared, versus one that scales as n log base 2 of n, which means the bigger the data set, the greater the savings. A signal with a thousand samples would require a hundred times fewer calculations. And a million samples would require 50,000 times fewer calculations. But how do you know which calculations are redundant? Well, take your samples and split them into even and odd index points. You still need to multiply each of these by the eight different frequency waves. But now let's look only at the even points and compare the first four frequencies to the second four frequencies. And what you find is that in each case at the location of the samples, the values of the two sine waves are the same. A similar pattern can be observed for the odd index points, except the values of one sine wave are the negative of the other. More generally, they're related by a complex number. But what this means is that you don't have to do all the multiplications for the second half of the frequencies. Once you've calculated the odd and even sums for the lower half of the frequencies, you can reuse these values to find the upper half. So you've effectively cut the number of calculations required in half. But that's only a factor of two. How do you get down to n log base 2 of n? Well, you repeat the same trick. Split the samples again into even and odd points, and then again repeatedly until you're down to single data points. At each split, you can exploit the symmetries of sinusoidal functions to cut the number of calculations in half. And that is how the fast Fourier transform reduces n squared calculations down to n log n. And it's why today, whenever anyone takes a Fourier transform, it's almost always done as a fast Fourier transform. Garwin approached an IBM researcher, James Cooley, to program a computer to run the FFT algorithm. But he didn't tell him the reason was to detect underground Soviet nuclear tests. He said it was to work out the spins in a crystal of helium-3. Cooley and Tukey published the algorithm in a seminal 1965 paper, and its use immediately took off. But it was too late to secure a comprehensive nuclear test ban. By that time, the UK, France, and China had joined the Soviet Union and the US as nuclear powers. And the partial test ban treaty, far from de-escalating the nuclear arms race, just sent it underground. The thinking was, if you were only allowed to test underground, then you better be testing extensively so as not to fall behind all the other nuclear states. So from 1963, 1,500 nuclear weapons were detonated. That's roughly one a week for 30 years. This testing facilitated the construction of an absurd number of nukes. At the peak in the mid-1980s, 70,000 nuclear warheads were in existence. Total expenditure on nukes in the 20th century is estimated at around $10 trillion each for the US and the Soviet Union adjusting for inflation. If only scientists had been confident in their ability to remotely detect underground tests in the early 1960s, then a comprehensive test ban could have been reached, stopping the nuclear arms race before it really got going. To check how realistic this is, I asked Richard Garwin himself. Well, it's a good story. It is a good story. It would have helped, and it might have turned the tide. But that would have required an earlier discovery of the fast Fourier transform. And as luck would have it, it was discovered earlier, but then forgotten. All the way back in 1805, mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss was studying the newly discovered asteroids of Pallas, Ceres, and Juno. To determine the orbit of Juno, Gauss devised a novel approach to harmonic analysis, and he jotted it down in his notes, but later used a different method, and he never thought to publish that first insight. Today, we can see that Gauss had figured out the discrete Fourier transform before Joseph Fourier himself published it in 1807. And he had developed the same fast Fourier transform algorithm as Cooley and Tukey a century and a half earlier. The reason his breakthrough was not widely adopted was because it only appeared after his death in volume three of his collected works, and it was written with non-standard notation in a 19th century version of Latin. What do you think would have happened if Gauss had realized the significance of his discovery and had published it in a way that others could understand? With our modern network of seismometers and computing and the fast Fourier transform, today we have the ability to detect magnitude three events, which correspond to a one kiloton or so explosion basically anywhere on Earth. Following Cooley and Tukey's paper, the use of FFTs exploded, and they are the basis for most compression algorithms like the ones that allow you to watch and listen to this video. Here's how the fast Fourier transform allows you to compress an image. You take the pixel brightness values for each row of an image and perform a fast Fourier transform. So essentially you're figuring out what frequencies are present in the brightness values of the rows of an image. Here, brightness represents the magnitude of each frequency component, and the color represents the phase, how shifted that frequency is to the left or the right. And then you perform another FFT for the columns of pixels. It doesn't matter if you do the rows or columns first, what you need is a two dimensional FFT of the original image. For almost all real world images, you find that a lot of the values in the transform are close to zero. I've taken the log of the transform values so you can see them, but if I don't, then it's clear most of the values, especially toward the edges, are very small. These correspond to high frequencies. And what this means is that you can throw out a lot of the information in the transformed image, say 99% of it. But when you invert that result, you still get a fairly good representation of the original image. So on your computer, most of the images will be saved in this form as a two dimensional fast Fourier transform. And then when you want to look at the picture again, the computer simply inverts the transform. There are so many applications for FFTs, from solving differential equations to radar and sonar, studying crystal structures, Wi-Fi and 5G. Basically, all kinds of signal processing use FFTs. And that's why mathematician Gilbert Strang called the FFT the most important numerical algorithm of our lifetime. If only it had become more widely adopted after Gauss discovered it, the FFT may have even more dramatically transformed our world. Now, I don't think Gauss could ever have imagined how important the FFT would be, just as most people don't think about the cumulative impact of their life's work.

Nearly half of men say they do most of the homeschooling. 3% of women agree. I bring this up not to debate who's right, but because it's a great example of something called egocentric bias. Most people think they do most of the work. For example, researchers have asked authors of multi-author papers what percentage of the work they personally did. And when they add up those percentages, the sum is on average 140%. When couples are asked to estimate how much of the housework they do, the combined total is almost always over 100%. Now you might think this is because people wanna appear more helpful than they actually are, but that's not it. When couples are asked what fraction of the fights they start or how much of the mess is theirs, the total is again over 100. People think they do more of the work, but they also think they cause more of the problems. So why is this? I think it's simply because you experience and remember vividly all of what you do, but not all of what everyone else does. So naturally you overestimate your own contributions and underestimate others. And I think this bias leads us to underestimate the influence of other things on our lives, like the role luck plays in our success. Take hockey players for example. If you ask a professional hockey player how they managed to reach the NHL, they might mention their hard work, determination, great coaches, their parents' willingness to get up at 5 a.m. and so on, but they probably won't acknowledge how lucky they were to be born in January. And yet in many years, 40% of hockey players selected into top tier leagues are born in the first quarter of the year, compared to just 10% in the fourth quarter. An early birthday can make you up to four times as likely to be a pro hockey player. And the reason for this disparity is presumably because the cutoff date for kids' hockey leagues is January 1st. Those born in the first part of the year are a little older and so on average bigger and faster than kids in their league born late in the year. Now as they grow up, this difference should eventually shrink to nothing, but it doesn't. Because the young kids who show the most promise are given more time on the ice and enter more tournaments where they receive better coaching and improve their skills. And these advantages compound year after year, so by the time you get to the pros, birthdays are heavily skewed towards the start of the year. But does any professional hockey player feel thankful for their birthday? Probably not. And we are all like that, largely oblivious to the fortunate events that support our success. Probably the most significant bit of luck many of us enjoy is being born into a prosperous country. Around half the variance in income received by people around the world is explained by their country of residence and that country's income distribution. If you were born in Burundi, for example, which has the world's lowest gross national income per capita of just $730 a year, it doesn't matter how smart or hardworking you are, you're unlikely to earn much as an adult. Now, many people get offended if you point out how big a role chance plays in their success. And I get it, if we are just a product of our circumstances, then our hard work and our talent seem to count for nothing. People think it has to be either skill or luck that explains success. But the truth is, you need both. Take these eight track and field world records. All the athletes who achieve these records are obviously world class, extremely dedicated and talented, and yet when they achieved their world records, seven out of eight had a tailwind. Now, these athletes all had the ability to win a gold medal, but to set the world record required a bit of luck as well. The importance of luck increases the greater the number of applicants applying for just a few spaces. Consider the most recent class of NASA astronauts. From over 18,300 applicants in 2017, only 11 were selected and went on to graduate from the astronaut training program. And we can make a toy model of the selection process. Let's assume that astronauts are selected mostly based on skill, experience, and hard work, but also say 5% as a result of luck, fortunate circumstances. For each applicant, I randomly generated a skill score out of 100, and I also randomly generated a luck score out of 100. Then I added those numbers together, weighted in the 95 to five ratio to get an overall score. This score represents the selector's judgments, meaning the top 11 by this metric would become astronauts. And I repeated this simulation a thousand times, representing a thousand different astronaut selections. And what I found was the astronauts who were picked were very lucky. They had an average luck score of 94.7. So how many of the selected astronauts would have been in the top 11 based on skill alone? The answer was on average only 1.6. That means even with luck accounting for just 5% of the outcome, nine or maybe 10 of the 11 applicants selected would have been different if luck played no role at all. When competition is fierce, being talented and hardworking is important, but it's not enough to guarantee success. You also need to catch a break. Largely, I think we're unaware of our good luck because by definition, it's not something we did. Like the housework done by your significant other, it goes unappreciated. And here's the crazy thing. Downplaying the importance of chance events may actually improve your probability of success because if you perceive an outcome to be uncertain, you're less likely to invest effort in it, which further decreases your chances of success. So it's a useful delusion to believe you are in full control of your destiny. I mean, if I had known how bad I was when I started YouTube or how much work it would take, I might have given up right then. Welcome to Veritasium, an online science video blog. Now, there may be another benefit to overlooking your lucky breaks, which is it makes it easier to justify your place in society. If you have a lot of wealth or power, you can just chalk it up to your own intelligence, effort and perseverance. It makes it easier to accept inequality. In one experiment, participants were put in groups of three in small rooms to discuss a complex moral problem. And one person in each group was randomly designated the team leader. Half an hour later, the experimenter came by with four cookies for each team. So who got the extra cookie? In each case, it went to the team leader. Even though they had no special aptitude, they didn't have extra responsibilities and they'd gotten their position through chance alone. Once you have achieved a certain status, it seems natural to feel like you deserve it and all the other good things that come your way. Now, this is just an anecdote, but whenever I've been upgraded to fly a business class, I've always observed the worst behavior in my fellow privileged passengers. They just act so entitled and uncourteous. And research has found evidence for this as well. In another experiment, participants were asked to think of a good thing that happened to them recently. And then one group was asked to list their own personal qualities or actions that made that good thing happen. Another group was asked to list external factors beyond their control that led to the event. And a control group was simply asked to list reasons why the good thing happened. Now for completing this task, participants were told they would be paid a dollar. But at the end, they were offered the option to donate some or all of the money to a charity. Results showed those who listed their own personal attributes contributed 25% less than those who listed external factors beyond their control. Now think of what all this means for people in our society, specifically for people in positions of power, like business leaders and politicians. Now, undoubtedly most of them are talented and hardworking, but they have also been luckier than most. And like most of us, they don't realize just how lucky they are. And this gives them a distorted view of reality. They're kind of living in a form of survivor bias. All these leaders have worked hard and ultimately succeeded. So to them, the world appears fair. In their experience, it rewards hard work. But what they don't have is the experience of all the people who have worked hard and failed. So what are they to make of people less successful than themselves? Well, the natural conclusion is that they must just be less talented or less hardworking. And this perspective makes them less inclined to be generous, to give back. And they are the ones who set the rules for how society operates. And this is particularly unfortunate since one of the main ways many of us are lucky is in our country of residence. But what is a country, except for the things put there by people who came before, the roads and the schools, public transport, emergency services, clean air and water, everything like that. It seems a cruel trick of our psychology that successful people without any malice will credit their success largely to their own hard work and ingenuity and therefore contribute less to maintaining the very circumstances that made that success possible in the first place. The good news is that acknowledging our fortunate circumstances not only brings us more in line with reality, it also makes us more likable. In a study where people had to read the transcript of a fictional 60 minutes interview with a biotech entrepreneur, experimenters tried changing just the last paragraph where the interviewee is talking about the reasons for their company's success. In one version, the entrepreneur personally takes credit for the success they've had. But in the other, he says luck played a significant role. Now people who read the luck version of the transcript judged the entrepreneur as kinder and thought they'd be more likely to be close friends with him than those who read the other version of the transcript. And raising our awareness of fortunate events can also make us happier because it allows us to feel gratitude. Personally, I am grateful to Michael Stevens of Vsauce who on October 7th, 2012 posted the video How Much Does a Shadow Weigh? which shouts out my slow motion slinky drop video. And within three days, my subscribers had increased by a third and within a month, they had doubled leading me to quit my part-time job and work exclusively on YouTube videos. And I'm grateful to the writer of the free newspaper they give out on the trains in Sydney who didn't quite understand electricity leading me to post this picture of their article to my Instagram with a caption, what's wrong with this picture? And I'm lucky that the first person to answer correctly was a beautiful woman who became my future wife. Yup, that is how I met your mother. Now, initially, I wanted to make this video just to say our circumstances and psychology conspire to make us oblivious to our own luck. And this leads successful people to view the world as fair and those less successful than them as less talented or less hardworking. And this is before you factor in any discrimination or prejudice. But it also became apparent to me that I should talk about what to do if you want to be successful in such a world. And I think the best advice is paradoxical. First, you must believe that you are in complete control of your destiny and that your success comes down only to your own talent and hard work. But second, you've got to know that's not true for you or anyone else. So you have to remember if you do achieve success that luck played a significant role and given your good fortune, you should do what you can to increase the luck of others. Hey, so I had an idea for what I could do to increase the luck of others. And that is to give away 100 Snatoms kits to people who couldn't otherwise afford them. So if you didn't know, Snatoms is a product that I invented and kickstarted five years ago. It's a molecular modeling kit where all the atoms snap together magnetically. Now, I made it because I really wanted to tackle the misconception that bonds store energy. They don't. It takes energy to break them. And you can feel that with Snatoms. Recently, I completely retooled Snatoms. So there are small holes where the magnets are. This allows them to touch directly, increasing the bonding strength so you can form bigger, more stable molecules. I call these Snatoms X. And yes, they are backwards compatible with original Snatoms. So here's my idea. For the next month, you can buy Snatoms for 10% off using the code GIVELUCK. And for each one sold, I will give a kit to someone who can't afford one, up to a limit of 100. So I'll put links and more details in the description. And I really wanna thank you for watching. And thank you for all my good luck.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 2298\n","\n","Link  316 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/J_n1FZaKzF8\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/J_n1FZaKzF8\n","[youtube] J_n1FZaKzF8: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] J_n1FZaKzF8: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 22.99MiB in 08:05\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  This is the biggest, most ambitious, most expensive video I've ever made, and it's also gonna be terrifying. We are strapping these giant metal weights to the belly of that helicopter, flying it up several kilometers in the sky, and then dropping these weights on a sandcastle city. I mean, we need luck. And this is all for a very good reason, so let's do it, come on. In the late 1950s, the United States had a problem. The Soviet Union launched the first artificial satellite, Sputnik, into orbit around the Earth on the 4th of October 1957. But less well known is that just over a month earlier, they successfully tested the first intercontinental ballistic missile, or ICBM. It could deliver a nuclear warhead from the Soviet Union to cities on the US East Coast in around 30 minutes. Facing this threat, a researcher at Boeing named Jerry Purnell came up with an idea for a space weapon. It could hit any location on Earth in half that time, just 15 minutes. It could destroy targets buried 30 meters underground, like the silos where the Soviet nukes were kept, and theoretically it could intercept ICBM's mid-flight. His concept was to put telephone pole-sized pieces of tungsten in space, in orbit, so that these pieces of tungsten could drop on a target basically at any time. The idea was within a 15 minute window, you would be able to release one of these tungsten rods and have it re-enter the atmosphere and strike a target in minutes. And it would come in so fast, you know in orbit, things go about 8 kilometers per second. And as it enters the atmosphere, it's gonna slow down due to the atmospheric drag, but still on impact it's still gonna be going like 10 times the speed of sound Mach 10 or about 3 kilometers per second. This is MOAB, which stands for Massive Ordnance Air Blast, but it's more commonly referred to by its nickname, the mother of all bombs. It is one of the most powerful non-nuclear explosives on the planet. When it detonated, it released the equivalent of 11 tons of TNT. Now just one of these tungsten rods coming in would have the same energy as the largest conventional explosive ever detonated. They are not bombs, they contain no explosives, but the amount of energy that they're carrying in their kinetic energy because they are so heavy and they're going so fast, it is as big as any conventional bomb ever detonated. Pernell called his weapon Project Thor after the Norse god who threw lightning bolts from the heavens. In the 1980s, the kinetic missile interceptor idea was seriously considered by the Reagan administration. It was codenamed Brilliant Pebbles, but the project was abandoned. In 2003, it was resurrected by the Air Force Transformation Plan, which referred to this weapon as Hypervelocity Rod Bundles, but colloquially the weapon is known as Rods from God. The kinetic energy of an object is directly proportional to its mass and its velocity squared. So increasing the object's mass ten times increases its kinetic energy ten times, but if you increase the velocity by a factor of ten, the kinetic energy grows by a factor of a hundred. This is why even very light objects can carry lots of kinetic energy. This is what a 15 gram piece of plastic does to a block of aluminum when traveling at six kilometers per second. And this is a real problem for satellites because of the massive speeds on orbit, micrometeorites, small bolts, or even flecks of paint are serious risks for the astronauts living on board the International Space Station. This chip in the window of the ISS was caused by a tiny speck of dust and a small piece of space junk punctured a hole in the robotic arm. Imagine something that weighs 10 tons traveling that fast. Kinetic energy weapons appear in fiction, including dozens of movies, video games, and books. But how realistic are they? Could this weapon ever become a reality? Well, that's why we're here in the middle of the desert. We want to see how damaging a rod from God could be. And we really pulled out all the stops, even hiring a team of professional sandcastle builders to construct a city onto which we'll drop the rods. I have all the respect in the world for these sandcastle builders. We are seven-time U.S. Open sandcastle champions. That's so cool. It'll endure the test of the highest weight at the highest drop with very little damage. I'm really convinced of that. The U.S. Capitol is great. Yeah, isn't that great? Yeah. It's one of our favorite. I love all the buildings there. Who did the pickle? The gherkin. Yeah, the gherkin right here. Very nice. This is beautiful. I mean, I feel bad for trying to hit it. I am just very concerned about aiming. The city is not that big. So before we get to that drop, we're gonna try to hit this swimming pool with a 100 kilogram or a 220 pound mass. Probably go up about 500 meters, try to drop a weight right into this pool. I don't think it's gonna work. I don't think we're gonna hit it. In fact, my main concern for the whole day is that we're just not gonna be able to hit anything. And then what was the point coming out here in the first place? These are gonna be the questions that I asked myself. So the way we're targeting is with GPS. We're gonna take a GPS mark from like the center of the pool. Oh boy. We've also got GPS in the helicopter. We're gonna use that to try to line up square over the middle of the pool. So if we're able to hit this pool from 500 meters, then I think we've got a shot. Where's your GPS? My GPS is my phone. And I have the coordinates written on my arm. We're ready to go. We're professionals. First drop. And it's feeling shaky, I gotta tell you. I just don't know like why they're circling up that high. Is that 500 meters? That seems really high. 1500 feet? That seems higher than 1500 feet. That is freaking crazy. Okay. It's swinging around like crazy up there. Yeah, does it have fins on it? Jesus, no, no fins. Why didn't we have this conversation a week ago? We're good left to right. That's good. We just need to go forward. Oh, geez. That does not look like they're in position, right? Are you kidding me? Oh my, what the what is that gonna hit? Oh, it is going sideways. What did it hit? Oh, geez. That was way more off than I thought. It didn't look like you guys were moving, but yeah, he's telling me our horizontal velocity was zero. And you were in the right spot. We were exactly in the right spot. Oh, wow. Oh, wow. Look at that. Oh, wow. Totally, totally buried. Falling from 500 meters, the rod accelerated for 10 seconds. And even accounting for air resistance, it hit the ground going about 350 kilometers per hour. At that speed with a mass of 100 kilograms, it was carrying nearly half a million joules of kinetic energy. Our plan for the day is to drop something twice as heavy from six times higher. Then its energy on impact will be greater than the explosion of a kilogram of TNT. Kinetic impacts are explosive. If you look at the craters on the moon and you look really closely, you're gonna see that they're basically all circles. I think no one stops to ask, why are they circular? If you imagine when the moon gets hit by asteroids, they're gonna come in from all different directions. So shouldn't you get these sort of oblong shapes where the asteroid comes in? Well, the truth is the asteroids come in with such incredible speed that it's not like they're pushing dirt out of the way and that's what creates the crater. No, they're coming in so fast that when they collide, their kinetic energy is explosive. It heats up the ground, turns things into liquid and gas. They all get super hot and they spray outwards in a giant explosion. And this explosion is symmetric. It doesn't matter which angle or how shallow the asteroid was coming in. It's gonna blow out everything radially because it is explosive. Kinetic energy is explosive and I think for me that's just the really surprising thing. It would be the exact same thing with dropping these rods going Mach 10 when they hit a target. They're gonna create an explosion as though they are the largest conventional weapon ever launched. And because it's going so fast, it can penetrate around 30 meters of soil, enough to bust bunkers or silos. And the explosion is therefore more localized so it can be used for precise surgical strikes. Plus, unlike a nuclear weapon, there's no radioactive fallout to worry about or international laws. Do these ideas contravene any current laws or treaties? No, the only international agreement there is about putting weapons in space is about nuclear weapons. The only real prohibition is is about putting nuclear weapons in space. Man, like I thought targets would be hard to hit. Now I'm like super convinced they're impossible to hit. What we're gonna do now we're gonna do much lower altitude and we're gonna do it visually. Yeah. So we're gonna do it you know 300 feet visually. I love it. I'm gonna do a cube drop. Cube drop is interesting because I was like we shouldn't do a cube drop. We're here talking about rods of God, they're cylinders right? Now I'm so thankful we have the cubes because the cylinders as Adam Savage told me. Cylinders tend to fall on their sides have given enough chance. Really? Who would have thought? I would have thought like you know a pencil type thing it would it would tend to aim straight down. That still looks high. Is that a hundred meters? 30 second call? It doesn't look like they're over the pool. It's totally blowing around in the wind. It's totally swinging. GPS is spot on and I see it right below. Still feels high. We're on it! We're on it! All right that wasn't far off. We're off by 60 feet. Oh wow. Did you look like we were right above it? Look like it yeah. Wow. There's ice shoulders right on it as well. That's something from a hundred meters. I'll take it. Okay we're setting up to drop this mass 200 kilograms 440 pounds. What do you think? Yeah we're gonna get there. Are we gonna hit it this time? I hope so. This is the moment of truth. We've had two misses so far so we're going 50 meters or 150 feet above the pool which for me it's pretty disappointing but at this point I just want to hit something. Oh boy. The weight is swinging around on there. It's getting blown around by the wind. I mean we need luck. There it goes. There it goes. There it goes. I'm tracking tracking. It hit something! Yes! It's like right on the edge. Right on the edge. This morning I was so worried that we weren't gonna hit anything and like I think the footage is so shaky because I was so excited but like seeing that from above was amazing. Wow it ripped right through the pool. Unbelievable. So is the next target the sandcastle and you want to go for a hundred meters? I want to double it. This will be amazing if we can actually hit the sandcastle from a hundred meters that'll be something. In all the different incarnations of rods from God the rods are made out of tungsten and there are two reasons for this. The first is that tungsten is really really dense. A cubic meter of tungsten weighs 19 tons. That's over twice the density of steel which is what we're using here just because it's a lot cheaper but that means for a given amount of mass tungsten rods could be less than half the volume of steel and therefore encounter less resistance as they pass through the atmosphere. And importantly for reentry tungsten also has an incredibly high melting point the highest of any metal at almost three and a half thousand degrees Celsius. This is important because as the rod decelerates through the atmosphere a lot of heat builds up all around it and tungsten's high melting point means the rods require much less shielding to prevent them from melting. The shape is also important the goal is to hit the target with as much speed as possible so a sleek aerodynamic shape is best and rods are a great shape for that. Aerodynamics is why arrows and bullets and ballistic missiles all look the way they do it's to minimize drag. Honestly one of the big mistakes we made was not welding fins onto our rods. We're going up to about a hundred meters or 300 feet before we drop. We're gonna hit the Sandcastle City that's the goal. Any minute, any second. There it goes, there it goes, there it goes, it's going. Did it hit in front? Just in front. We just missed it. We were close, we were really close. So the tractor's gonna dig the weight out right now. Just pick it up. Go! That's how it landed. So close to taking out the Capitol. Yeah look at that. 30 seconds to drop. God that wind. 20 seconds. 20 seconds. That wind is brutal. Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy. Hit something on the left but I don't think it was the city. Seeing all the challenges we're going through reminds me just how difficult it is to aim a kinetic projectile. 10 seconds. A kinetic projectile. 10 seconds. There it goes. Did they hit a building? What? What? What? I cannot believe it. Direct hit on the building but it only took down that side. I find it unbelievable. Look at the cracks in the back. And like it created cracks but it didn't make the hole. Didn't destroy the whole building. This is not what you would use if you wanted to cause mass devastation. This is like if you wanted to to pinpoint a target. Now if I'm honest, we did not manage to make a fair test of Rods from God even on a small scale. I wanted to drop 200 kilograms from three kilometers but aiming was so hard that we got nowhere near that. So we didn't get to see the explosive power of kinetic energy. When we made one last ditch attempt to drop again from 500 meters, I was just terrified that we were going to hit something or someone. Look out. Look out. Look out. Look out. Look out. I was just happy to finish the day with everyone safe. I didn't shoot that because I was so terrified. Oh I see it. Wow. You're right that it bounced out. But given the amount of time and money we spent on this video, I would say it is my biggest failure of all time. Which as it turns out is also something you could say about the actual weapon, Rods from God. I mean just start with aiming. Steering a Rod from God is in theory possible. You could use thrusters or adjustable fins or change the Rod's center of mass but in practice it's incredibly difficult to aim an object traveling at hypersonic speeds. Not only that, communicating with the Rod from the ground or from space would be nearly impossible due to the superheated plasma surrounding it. And there are other problems. You know say you want to hit a target within 15 minutes. You'd think the simplest thing would be to put a Rod right above the target in geostationary orbit. But geostationary orbit is over 35,000 kilometers away. That's almost a tenth the distance to the moon. So from there a Rod would take several hours to fall to the earth. And if you put it in low earth orbit, say around 350 kilometers above the earth, the Rod will move relative to the ground doing a revolution around the earth every 90 minutes. So between ordering a strike and the Rod hitting the target that could take anywhere up to an hour and a half. You might think that you could get that time down to about 30 minutes by placing say 10 satellites in that orbit. But remember the earth rotates so orbits drift. You would actually need hundreds of satellites to make sure there's always a Rod close by the target. So let's say you want to put a hundred Rods into space. Well the cost of launching them will be billions of dollars. And over time the thrusters will break down and malfunction. So there are going to be ongoing maintenance costs. But what if you just want to use it for missile defense? Well then you don't need something that weighs 10 tons. A smaller Rod would do. But even then it's really really tricky. And to successfully intercept an ICBM you've got to hit it during the boost phase. Modern ICBMs split into a number of payloads after the boost, some of which are decoys to overwhelm anti-ICBM defense missiles. To stop North Korean ICBM launches for example the US would need around 400 Rods spread among eight orbits to be able to intercept missiles in time. A global defense system would require at least a few times that amount. And it's been calculated that even a very limited system would cost around 300 billion dollars, which is nearly half of the US military annual budget. And even that wouldn't work because enemies could evade the defense by launching several missiles at the same time. Since there's only one Rod in the right location at any time a Rod could intercept one of the missiles but the rest would pass through. So Rods from God turns out to be unfeasible to execute in reality. After his stint at Boeing Jerry Purnell who came up with the idea became a science fiction writer. And in his 1985 New York Times best-selling book Footfall an alien race uses kinetic weapons to invade the earth. And honestly I'm pretty glad that this weapon is feasible only in science fiction.

It's a story about what happens when the desire to educate comes into conflict with the desire to get paid. Finally, it's a story about how some of the most valuable companies in the world are using educational YouTube as a vector for misinformation. And, to unpack all of this, we're going to talk about one of the biggest science channels on the platform, Veritasium. In July 2021, the science YouTube channel Veritasium released a video titled Why You Should Want Driverless Cars on Roads Now. It featured the channel's host and founder, Derek Muller, making a characteristically compelling argument for the embrace of autonomous vehicles. Attempting to debunk the anxiety some people feel about having driverless cars loose on public roads, Muller asserts that self-driving vehicles are actually far safer than their human-driven alternatives and have the potential to both save lives and greatly improve contemporary urban life. A large part of the video is delivered from the backseat of one of a fleet of driverless taxis currently operated in Phoenix, Arizona by Waymo, the successor to Google's self-driving car project. All in all, it amounts to a glowing review of currently existing driverless car technology in general and Waymo's implementation of that technology in particular. Muller so thoroughly punctures any concerns that one might have about autonomous vehicles that it's hard not to come away from the video as an enthusiastic evangelist for self-driving cars. For a YouTube channel which derives its name from the Latin word for truth to be able to make a video which is so uncompromisingly positive, so lacking in caveats or caution, must be reflective of a highly refined technology, right? Well, no. It's actually reflective of little more than the size of Waymo's PR budgets. For, as Muller admits 30 seconds in, this is a sponsored video, paid for by Waymo and very clearly designed to contribute to their present PR strategy. To describe the video as an advert is perhaps to slightly miss the point. The primary goal here isn't to promote Waymo's taxi service to potential customers, that's only actually available to unvetted members of the public in a handful of Phoenix suburbs, so most people can't use it anyway. Instead, the video is a more general attempt to reassure viewers about a technology that has been attracting some increasingly negative headlines. In December 2020, Uber lost confidence in its long-standing dream of automating its ride-hailing service and sold its self-driving car division to a competitor. A few months later, the poster child for techno-optimism, Elon Musk, similarly revealed that he didn't expect it to be so hard to implement full self-driving capabilities in Tesla vehicles. And in May of this year, embarrassment came knocking at Waymo's own door when a video circulated online of one of its self-driving taxis getting confused by some traffic cones blocking two lanes of traffic and then trying to escape the support team that came to the aid of the trapped passenger. Such stories have combined with a steady drip of crashes and near-crashes involving cars with self-driving capabilities to make some people feel that driverless vehicles might be at best an overly ambitious pipe dream and at worst potentially quite dangerous. In September 2021, Morning Consult revealed that the share of US adults who believe autonomous vehicles are safer than regular cars has fallen by 5 points to just 22%. It's no surprise that Waymo, which is currently looking to expand its experimental taxi service to new cities, would want to push back on these perceptions. Should opposition to self-driving cars gain too much traction, then securing permits to test these vehicles on public roads is likely to become much more difficult. That they might turn to a YouTube channel as part of their pushback campaign might, until just a few years ago, have seemed much less likely. Nevertheless, those of you that have watched some of my previous videos or who follow me on Twitter will know that I've been keeping an eye on this growing trend of companies, billionaires and elite institutions using sponsorship deals with purportedly educational channels to promote their own highly selective and self-interested vision of the world for some time. Earlier this year, we took a look at a video by ex-Vox journalist Johnny Harris to foreground this emergent practice in which a creator goes beyond integrating a brief advert for a product or service into their video and turns off their critical faculties entirely, working with a company or institution to craft a video which, from start to finish, is little more than corporate propaganda. Now as a rule, I don't think we owe it to creators who make these wholly sponsored fluff pieces to engage with the minutiae of their arguments. Whatever the merits of Veritasium's other work, and there are many, the choices surrounding what information to include in this particular video are not being made with reference to what will leave viewers with the most rounded understanding of autonomous vehicles, but instead with reference to Waymo's current PR goals. This is, in short, a completely disingenuous and unserious contribution to the debate around driverless cars. That being said, I often struggle to convince others of this. Often as a result of the goodwill that creators have built up over the years, people might accept that a sponsorship tips the scales a tiny bit but will be hesitant to believe that an entire video could be completely worthless. In fact, Muller himself sums up many people's attitudes towards these kinds of corporate partnerships when, following his revelation that the Veritasium video is sponsored by Waymo, he gives a little shrug as if to say, no big deal. Today then, we are going to engage with the arguments put forward in Why You Should Want Driverless Cars on Roads Now. We're going to look at Muller's invocation of dubious comparisons with other technologies, his misrepresentation of statistics and the highly, highly selective approach he takes to discussing the capabilities of Waymo's vehicles. What we'll find is that, while the video doesn't contain any outright falsehoods, its central argument relies on Muller being extremely careful about what he does and doesn't say. By the end of the video, hopefully you'll have a sense of how damaging these pieces can be to our collective understanding of the world, why we should be sceptical of anyone who describes themselves as an educator involving themselves in the creation of such content and why we should resist the further normalisation of such practices. To reiterate, while we're going to be focusing primarily on Veritasium's partnership with Waymo today, Muller and his team are far from the only science, tech and or educational YouTubers to periodically give corporate sponsors the opportunity to influence the editorial content of their videos. In fact, the video we're discussing today was itself just one part of a larger PR campaign in which Waymo recruited five YouTube channels and tasked them with creating videos which would push back against declining trust in self-driving cars. Some of these channels helpfully included some screen recordings of what one of the creators described as a round table and what others might try to characterise as a press event, but comparing extracts from the events to the resulting videos seems to have involved little more than Waymo staff briefing the sponsored creators on what to include in their videos. The uploads which resulted from this campaign varied depending on the size, resources and styles of the channels making them. Shannon Morse's video simply involved her talking to camera with the occasional bit of stock footage overlaid to keep things visually interesting. The video released by Snazzy Labs favours showing clips from the briefing event itself, allowing Waymo specialists to explain how the company's vehicles operate in their own words. By far the most entertaining video is by Jason Silver, largely because of how sensationalist and ridiculously superlative laden the whole thing is. Silver also doesn't seem to entirely understand the technology he's been told to talk about and so is reduced to drawing upon Arthur C. Clarke to describe self-driving cars as indistinguishable from magic. The Veritasium video is clearly that which has had the most time and resource pumped into it. This is reflective of both the channel being much more established than the others and, presumably, the much larger payment that would therefore have come attached to the sponsorship team. Interestingly, where other channels have apparently been asked to include the hashtag Waymo Ambassador either in the description of their videos or in the video itself, the team at Veritasium appears to have negotiated that term away. And this is interesting in that it hints at a desire to not want to be seen to be too close to the company the video will discuss, even if the content of the video itself remains dubious. What really sets the Veritasium video apart is that it is the only sponsored video in this campaign in which someone actually rides in a Waymo car. And notably, this does not work in the video's favour. In an attempt to showcase the car's ability to deal with tricky situations, Muller instructs it to drive through a car park. In the event, there aren't actually any other moving vehicles around. Nevertheless, there is a person pushing a trolley along the pavement. Despite this person being a decent distance away and being well within the bounds of the pavement, the car comes to a screeching halt. The wheels actually squeal it so abrupt. Muller tries to turn this into a positive, using it as an opportunity to talk about how the Waymo software calculates various different possibilities of what might happen in any given scenario. Ultimately, though, it's not convincing. One is left to wonder whether the software's reasoning is so uncertain that it stops every time it sees a person on the pavement just in case they leap out into the road. While the Veritasium video may be a more accomplished production than those released by the other creators involved in this campaign, however, the key talking points remain broadly the same. Throughout each of the videos, the same statistics, many of which we'll critique later, crop up time and again. We repeatedly hear about how 94% of serious road accidents in the US are caused by human drivers. More about that figure later. And how the Waymo software has driven a cumulative 20 million miles. More about that figure later too. Several of the same cutesy anecdotes are repeated by different creators. In fact, if one watches through all five videos, one finds clips of Waymo employees at the briefing event priming the creators with talking points which later crop up in videos by the other channels framed as opinions that the hosts have come to of their own accord. Now, it would be entirely possible to scrutinise Veritasium's contribution to this PR campaign by playing through the video in question and ridiculing it for its general cheesiness. There's one moment, for example, where, having supposedly come to the end of his planned ride in the Waymo vehicle, Muller is apparently having so much fun that he just can't bear to get out. He therefore calls the support team and arranges to extend his ride. Putting aside the weirdness of the fact that extending his ride involves him having to get out of the car, wait for it to drive around the block and then come back and pick him up again, are we really supposed to believe that the initial plan for the day's filming was for him to just be left on some random residential street in Phoenix? Nevertheless, while the silliness of this presentational veneer is worth noting, what I'm really interested in today are the more sincere arguments that the video makes for the swift and widespread adoption of driverless cars, and the statistics and anecdotes which supposedly substantiate those arguments. For some people might posit that sponsored videos like this can be a win-win for viewers and the sponsoring companies. Viewers are able to gain an insight into emerging technologies, the argument might go, whilst companies are able to increase their brand recognition. Digging into the claims that Muller makes in this video, however, destroys this premise entirely, with any claims to education being swiftly overshadowed by mountains of corporate fluff and misinformation.

And with that, it's on with the show! Having pieced together some of the financial backdrop to the creation of this video, we can finally get on to examining some of the claims that are made about Waymo's self-driving cars within it. As mentioned previously, the video kicks off with the channel's host, Derek Muller, acknowledging the sponsorship deal with Waymo before climbing into the back of one of the company's vehicles and setting off on his ride around the Phoenix suburbs. Finally, at just over a minute in, he begins to build the foundations of his argument. The preconception at the heart of this video is that self-driving cars are underdeveloped, can occasionally be dangerous and that we should therefore be cautious in how and when we allow them to be used. Muller evidences the prevalence of this view through showing us the results of a YouTube community poll, which revealed that 40% of Veritasium's audience believes that self-driving car technology wouldn't be ready for at least another 10 years. Highlighting the lack of a driver in the moving vehicle that he's sat in, Muller makes it clear that his goal in this video will be to prove those doubters wrong. And for those people, I have news, which is that, well, there is no driver in this car. Following a brief potted history of Waymo, and, interestingly, long, long before his frankly dubious explanation of how the company's vehicles work, Muller's first approach to doing so is to foreground two other ways in which automation is used in our lives which may have once been seen as alarming or dangerous but which most people now routinely accept as safe. He begins with lifts or elevators to our American friends, suggesting that concerns surrounding self-driving cars can be likened to the public response to the introduction of automated elevators. When people started putting in driverless elevators, well, the public was very concerned and they didn't want to ride in those elevators. Now this obviously isn't a very good comparison. As Muller quickly admits, elevators only have to travel in one dimension and a lift shaft is a highly controlled environment relative to the multitude uncertainties of public roads. Interestingly, this section is also entirely plagiarised. A quick Google search reveals it to have been lifted beat for beat from a 2015 Planet Money interview with architectural historian Lee Gray. We won't have time to go into Veritasium's somewhat disingenuous approach to referencing and citing evidence for this video today, however, it just seems unnecessarily rude not to have credited the source here. Muller's second choice of comparison is more successful, though not for the reasons that he thinks it is. He continues by discussing Autoland, the automated guidance system that is used to land aeroplanes in conditions of low visibility. I saw this particular landing where a plane is coming in into Vienna and it's just so foggy that the pilots can see almost nothing. This is the view from the cockpit and yet they make a perfect textbook landing right on target. So how do they do it? The answer is the pilots didn't do it. It was a cat 3 autoland procedure. The plane just came in and landed itself essentially. The automation of plane landings is obviously far more complex and therefore impressive than the operation of an elevator. The problem with using it to make the case for the rollout of driverless cars is that Autoland is far more limited and requires the involvement of many more human beings than Muller cares to mention. For one, the suggestion that the plane landed itself ignores the fact that a good deal of the technology which makes these landings possible is on the ground. Those of you that have flown to or from large airports may have noticed an array of antennae at the end of the runway. Collectively, these are called the localizer and they essentially fire out a beam which, alongside other systems, guides the plane to the centre of the runway. The result is that Autoland procedures can only be accomplished at certain airports that have this kit. It's far from a case of the plane simply responding to the environment around it. Additionally, Autoland involves a lot of human input. There are several videos on YouTube of pilots flying the exact same model of plane featured in the clip that Muller shows us, and watching them, one finds it to be an incredibly involved process. They're not even just monitoring the landing either, pilots are actively involved in adjusting the speed of the aircraft, the flaps, deploying the landing gear and much more. And this is before we consider the huge number of people involved in monitoring and making safe both the airspace and the runway. As we'll see later, these geographical limitations and the involvement of significant numbers of human beings actually makes Autoland pretty comparable to Waymo's vehicles. And admitting these caveats doesn't make the technology any less impressive. Unfortunately, at least in part due to the video being sponsored by Waymo, Muller is hell-bent on both pretending that automation technology is more capable than it actually is and on pretending that human involvement in its operation, rather than being essential, has the potential to be fatal. In a pretty distasteful turn, the video draws our attention to the case of Asiana Airlines Flight 214. When Asiana Airlines Flight 214 was on final approach to San Francisco, attempting to manually land the plane, the pilot accidentally left the throttle at zero, and by the time they realised and tried to abort the landing, it was too late. The plane crashed into the runway seawall and split in two. The implication of Muller's version of events is that the pilots of Flight 214 were too egotistical to make use of automated systems in landing the plane and that, if they had done so, the crash could have been avoided. The problem is that the pilots were making use of automated systems in the form of what's called an auto-throttle. More than this, the official investigation placed the onus for the crash on that very technology. On publishing the final report, the acting chairman of the investigating body told the BBC that, in their efforts to compensate for the unreliability of human performance, the designers of automated control systems have unwittingly created opportunities for new error types that can be even more serious than those they were seeking to avoid. To use the crash of Flight 214 as proof that autonomy is good and humans bad then is frankly ludicrous. This tragic episode is an argument for more caution, not less. There is likely a brilliant discussion to be had about what other implementations of automated and autonomous technology can teach us about how, why, when and where we, as a society, might want to deploy driverless cars. Unfortunately, again, at least in part due to the sponsoring relationship with Waymo, the Veritasian video chooses to do away with such nuance. By misrepresenting automated systems as more capable than they actually are, the video implies presidency over driverless cars to be entirely irrational. And in the next part of the video, I'm going to double down on this argument. In the interests of not making a long video even longer, we're going to largely skip over a couple of sections of the Veritasian video. In the first, Müller explains the five levels of autonomous driving and, in a barely concealed dig at Tesla's autopilot function, suggests that the supposed safety benefits of driverless cars only kick in once you reach full autonomy. All these drivers were trusting the technology too much, which makes almost fully autonomous vehicles potentially more dangerous than regular cars. So this is why Waymo decided that the only safe way to proceed is with a car that has at least level 4 autonomy. Footage from the Snazzy Labs video, which also makes the same point in exactly the same way, suggests that this pot shot at Tesla is drawn entirely from the briefing with Waymo's staff. The following section sees Müller take a tour around Waymo's depot and offices. This is fairly unremarkable, although it is the one part of the video where we get a hint at the considerable number of human beings required to ensure that Waymo's taxi service is safe. This is the depot where the cars go when they're not on the road, and it's also where people monitor all the rides in progress. There is then a bit more vlog-style footage, as well as the beginnings of an interview with the woman in charge of Waymo's ride-hailing operations, who, unsurprisingly, thinks Waymo is great. With all this over and done with, Müller returns to the central argument of his video, that self-driving cars are safer than their human-driven alternatives. This time, however, rather than trying to convince us that autonomy is safe, he settles for arguing that human drivers are less capable than we might like to think. This section is a bit death by statistics. Unlike in most of their other videos, Veritasium doesn't provide any sources for these figures. And a brief use of a search engine gives some indication as to why this might be. The figure suggesting that 74% of drivers believe themselves to be above average appears reputable, having come from a short 2003 article in the Journal of Safety Research. After this, however, things become more questionable. The idea that 60 million people were killed on the road in the 20th century and the comparison to World War II is lifted straight from Wikipedia. Wikipedia, in turn, cites an infographic produced by Information is Beautiful in 2012 to accompany an exhibition at the Wellcome Collection in London. The infographic's creators acknowledged at the time that there may be some inevitable double-counting broad estimations and ballpark figures. And consulting the spreadsheet which details the origins of each statistic, one finds road traffic accidents to be one of those causes of death for which no source is cited. This therefore appears to be a cautionary tale about relying too heavily on Wikipedia. Whilst it might reveal a slight lack of research rigour, however, whether the 60 million deaths figure is verifiable or not doesn't really affect the meat of the video's argument. People dying is tragic no matter the quantity. The more important figure in that respect is the claim that 94% of driving accidents are the result of human error. This statistic was included in Waymo's briefing to the five creators it recruited as part of this PR campaign but has also previously been used by Mueller to make the case for self-driving cars in a video released in 2017 sponsored by BMW. Unfortunately, when we actually read the report which the figure is taken from, we find Mueller and Waymo's weaponization of it to support the rollout of driverless cars to once again be a gross misrepresentation. The statistic is drawn from a two-page document released by the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in February 2015. Drawing on a body of data surrounding car crashes gathered eight years previously, the data sheet does indeed state that the critical reason for a crash was assigned to drivers in an estimated 2,046,000 crashes that comprise 94% of crashes at the national level. The following sentence, however, continues that, \"...in none of these cases was the assignment intended to blame the driver for causing the crash.\" This may seem confusing or contradictory at first, but Phil Koopman, an associate professor at Carnegie Mellon University who specializes in self-driving car safety, explains it well in a 2018 blog post. See, labeling the driver as the critical reason for a car crash does not necessarily mean that the crash took place due to negligence or malice. Instead, the critical reason for an accident is akin to the final point of failure leading up to the crash. Say for example, someone is driving perfectly diligently along a rural road when they unknowingly pass a stop sign which has been concealed by an overgrown bush. When they reach the upcoming crossroads, the road markings have also deteriorated to the point where the driver understandably believes it to be their right of way. They therefore continue straight ahead without stopping, at which point they collide with another vehicle. Now, if we wanted to assign blame for this crash, we'd probably say that it was the fault of whichever authority or body is in charge of trimming the hedge and maintaining the road markings. Nevertheless, the condition for assigning the critical reason in the NHTSA study was such that, as long as there was some possibility that the driver could have seen the other vehicle approaching their side and reacted to avoid the crash, the driver was still marked down as the critical reason for the incident. In short, while the 94% figure does include some people who were drunk driving or asleep at the wheel, it also includes people whose sole failing was not quite being able to react sufficiently after suddenly finding themselves in a difficult and dangerous scenario. The overtone of this section of the Veritasium video is clear that greater adoption of driverless cars has the potential to reduce the number of road accidents in the United States by up to 94%. Most of these errors are impossible for a machine to make. But if you have a vehicle that has, you know, lidar and radar and 29 cameras, you're just not going to hit them. It's also heavy on emotional manipulation. Every year when people are backing out of driveways or parking spaces, in the US up to 200 people are killed and it's frequently older people or children, the children of the drivers. The problem is that the adoption of driverless cars wouldn't be a solution in anywhere close to all of these cases. In our example of the neglected crossroads, an overgrown hedge and lack of road markings would be just as much of a problem for an autonomous vehicle as it would be for a human being. From the heights of Mueller's misleading 94%, Koopman suggests that autonomous vehicles might be able to cut fatalities in half if we can achieve parity with an average well-behaved human driver. As we'll see in the following section, that's still a big if, with driverless cars far less capable than Waymo and Mueller imply. Furthermore, none of this takes into account the new risks and dangers that would undoubtedly accompany greater use of autonomous vehicles. In this section then, we again find a refusal to approach the topic at hand with the slightest degree of nuance. A non-sponsored video about driverless cars could have featured a really interesting conversation about what problems autonomous vehicles will solve and those they won't. Instead, Veritasium chooses sensationalism and misrepresentation. Of course, there's a chance that the misrepresented statistics in this section are largely the result of confirmation bias, of stumbling across a figure that supports the argument that Waymo has asked Veritasium to make and simply not questioning it, rather than an active decision to leave out information that complicates their position. When it comes to the video's highly, highly selective explanation of how the Waymo vehicles work, however, such excuses begin to seem much less conceivable. For a video which is attempting to convince us that driverless cars are a safe and reliable technology, Veritasium's video is pretty light on technical explanation. In fact, it's not until 9 minutes and 16 seconds in that we're provided with any kind of overview of how Waymo's vehicles actually work. At this point, Milley gives us a brief tour of some of the systems through which the cars monitor their surroundings. We learn about the LIDAR system. We learn about its use of cameras. We also learn how it deals with emergency vehicles. And then, well, that's it. As Waymo and Veritasium see it, that is all the information that one needs to understand how these cars work. And as you can perhaps tell from my tone, that is not true. See, one goal of this video is to convince us that, if it wasn't for technophobic politicians, negativistic nimbies and red tape-loving bureaucrats, you would be able to hire a Waymo taxi in major cities across the US. And for that argument to be truly convincing, we have to believe that if those cultural and political hurdles could be overcome, you could drop a Waymo car in New York or Tampa or Detroit or Denver and it would just work. As such, in his technical rundown, Milley suggests that the vehicles operate by simply monitoring the environment around them and making decisions based on what they find. The way the LIDAR works is it shoots out invisible laser beams, scanning around millions of times a second and then it detects the reflection and how long it takes to come back allows you to determine how far it is to that object. So what it's doing is like painting a 3D picture of the world. This is certainly one very important aspect of how Waymo's vehicles work. The LIDAR and other sensors allow the cars to identify other vehicles, pedestrians, the colour of traffic lights and other live aspects of a driving situation. Yep, what Milley completely fails to mention is that the cars also require highly detailed maps to be prepared for any area that they want to operate in. As Waymo themselves describe it in their safety report, before our cars drive in any location, our team builds our own detailed, three-dimensional maps that highlight information such as road profiles, curves and sidewalks, lane markers, crosswalks, traffic lights, stop signs and other road features. Rather than rely on GPS, the Waymo Driver cross-references our pre-built maps with real-time sensor data to precisely determine their location on the road. In a similar mode to the earlier misrepresentation of Autoland systems then, what we find here is an inflation of the capabilities of Waymo's vehicles whilst also refusing to mention significant human involvement in building, processing and verifying intricate and diligently labelled scans of every street the car will drive down. This is before we even begin to take into account the team which monitor any Waymo journeys which are currently taking place or the support teams which roam the city prepared to spring into action when things go awry. Without wanting to pre-empt my conclusion too much, we have here a perfect example of why we should be sceptical of supposedly educational creators handing over their platforms to companies like Waymo. Where a non-sponsored video might have given us a complete and balanced insight into how Waymo's vehicles work, Veritasium's deal with the company sees them leaving out vital information in order to make their sponsor look good. Geographical limitations, and a failure to mention them, again become relevant in the penultimate section of the video. Prior to this there is another vlog section featuring the hilarious car park incident mentioned earlier and a discussion of the ethical questions surrounding whose life the driverless car should choose to save should a vehicle find itself forced to make a choice between hitting two people. Muller's argument here is incredibly weak, consisting of him just trying to reassure us that such events are rare and that we therefore shouldn't lose too much sleep over it. I hope it's sufficient to say in response that rare things still happen. In 2015, The Economist reported that the odds of an aeroplane crashing were 1 in 5.4 million, but as a society we still dedicate significant resources to try to stop that from happening. Where geography once again becomes an issue is when Muller returns to try to convince us that Waymo Software is, to borrow the phrase the company loves so much they've trademarked, the world's most experienced driver. He does so partly through continuing his cringe-worthily softball interview with the head of Waymo's ride-hailing operations. Perhaps the lowest moment in this interview sees Muller make the following suggestion… But he also throws a couple more statistics at us. Waymo loves to quote this statistic in their promotional literature. What they seem less keen to reveal is exactly where these 20 million miles of driving took place. For, throughout the Veritasium video, Muller simply refuses to mention that the reason that he filmed this video in the suburbs of Phoenix, Arizona is because that's the only place in the world where Waymo's taxi service operates. While in August 2021, the company began testing in San Francisco, a human safety driver is behind the wheel in every vehicle and prospective passengers are forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement. That's not to say that the vehicles are only driven in these two cities. The Waymo Safety Report claims that the cars have driven in more than 25 cities across 10 US states. Nevertheless, the proportion of those 10 million miles that have been driven in different places is highly significant. See, as Mahmoud Hikmet highlights in one of his videos about Waymo, the primary reason that the company is seeking to introduce its vehicles to new cities at the moment is because new environments bring new challenges. These vehicles are under a test and they're going to fail, they're going to run into edge cases. Some of them might seem really, really obvious, but it's really hard to account for all of those edge cases during initial testing. So what Waymo are hoping to achieve here in this public rollout is they're hoping to run into more of these edge cases. In short, letting the car drive up and down the same roads again and again eventually has diminishing returns. It might be amazing at driving on those particular roads, but still terrible elsewhere. We see this with Waymo's vehicles in relation to the weather. Phoenix has pretty favourable conditions for driving, it is generally clear and bright. The safety report does stress that the vehicles have been tested in other conditions, from sunny Phoenix, Arizona, to rainy Kirkland, Washington, across the snowy upper peninsula of Michigan, through Death Valley heat and in foggy San Francisco. Nevertheless, it would seem the company is still not entirely confident in the vehicle's ability to operate in all weathers. A 2019 blog post by the company's chief safety officer revealed that Waymo's taxis are designed to come to a safe stop under certain bad weather conditions and a Morning Brew article from July 2021 highlighted that certain conditions require the reintroduction of safety drivers behind the wheel. As with the statistics suggesting that 94% of accidents are the result of driver error then, while the 20 million mile figure might appear to be a slam dunk in favour of allowing Waymo carte blanche to launch a taxi service in every city in the world, the truth is far more complicated. And as we've come to expect from Veritasium in this video, none of those crucial questions are asked. Instead, as in the case of Waymo vehicles requiring highly detailed, human-verified maps of any roads that they drive on and that of the taxis being geofenced into a small area of Phoenix, the sponsorship deal with Waymo ensures that the video declines the opportunity to properly educate us about this technology in favour of leaving out any information which shows the company's vehicles to be anything less than perfect. Perhaps the most frustrating thing about the multitude of emissions and misrepresentations contained within this video is that admitting that the technology still has limits wouldn't make it much less impressive. While Müller hams up his enjoyment of being in the Waymo vehicle a bit, I can't imagine it would be anything but really, really cool to ride in one of these cars, they are an impressive feat of engineering. That being said, Müller rounds his video up by predicting some of the ways in which driverless cars might change the world. As I bring this video to a close, as well as wrapping up my points about the devastating effect corporate sponsorships have the potential to have on educational YouTube, I want to ask a few questions about whether driverless cars would really have the impact that Müller claims or whether there might be better alternatives to these problems already in existence. Throughout the videos sponsored by Waymo as part of their PR campaign, but particularly those by Veritasium, Snazzy Labs and Jason Silver, there's an interesting assumption which goes completely unacknowledged. It's the assumption that self-driving cars are the future of transport, with the only uncertainty being when they will become a viable option for replacing human-driven cars as the dominant mode of transit in the global north. In his 2018 book Winners Take All, Anand Chiridharadas suggests that, in recent years, technology companies have often used the circulation of such limited visions of the future as a key rhetorical tactic. He writes that, in Silicon Valley, prediction has become a popular way of fighting for a particular future while claiming merely to be describing what has yet to occur. The advantages of doing so are evident throughout this Veritasium video. By painting driverless cars as the only and inevitable future, you can portray anyone who is even mildly sceptical as simply a ratchety old fuddy-duddy who is standing in the way of progress. Even assuming that the present flaws in autonomous vehicle technology can be ironed out and there is nothing to say that they can't be, it's highly unlikely that they would solve many of the problems that Muller suggests they would. The idea that driverless cars would reduce congestion is a complete non-starter. Assuming people otherwise maintain the same habits, a car driven by a machine takes up the same amount of road space as one driven by a person. The suggestion that we could reclaim the wasted value, residing in the 95% of time that the average car spends parked is another excellent example of lying with statistics. It ignores the fact that much of that 95% is the night time or the middle of the day when people are working. For lots of people, the 5% of the time in which they need their cars is the same 5% of the time that everyone else is using their cars. Finally, whether autonomous cars would make getting around cheaper is just complete guesswork. Whilst the lack of a driver might reduce costs for taxi companies such as Waymo, there's nothing to say that they would pass those savings on to customers. The argument that Veritasium makes for driverless cars here is then pretty poor. If we take off the Waymo-sponsored blinkers which consider autonomous vehicles to be the only possible future of transportation for a moment, however, we find that the problems highlighted make a fantastic argument for another solution. Public transport. These problems of congestion, of the wasted value, both of the time that people spend driving and of everyone having their own personal vehicle that they only use 5% of the time, and finally of cost, these are all problems which would be much better addressed by well-funded, publicly-owned integrated mass transit systems. The vehicles could even be autonomous if you really want them to be. But I couldn't find a single sponsored video similar to those paid for by Waymo that making the case for the introduction of more usable public transport points us towards the larger problem that the existence of videos like this one by Veritasium highlights. On the one hand, what we have here is simply a bad educational video. At every opportunity, Veritasium chooses making Waymo look good over actually teaching us anything useful about driverless cars. In fact, in its multitude of misrepresentations and omissions of vital details, I think it's more than fair to call this misinformation. As I said at the very beginning of this video, it is a perfect example of why we should be highly sceptical of creators who are willing to hand over their platforms to corporate sponsors in this way. Nevertheless, it's also worth thinking about what effect these practices, particularly by supposedly educational channels, might have on our public discourse more broadly. Rightly or wrongly, YouTube has become a platform to which people flock not only for entertainment but for education and to seek out potential responses to the various social and political challenges facing our world. As is the case with this set of videos sponsored by Waymo, companies, corporate lobby groups and billionaires are increasingly using sponsorship deals to ensure that the answers that people find on the platform are amenable to their interests. Actual solutions which serve everyone, such as in this case public transport, tend not to have anyone willing to bankroll sponsored videos on their behalf. We might not be able to change that, but we can at least become attuned to recognising and critiquing these corporate propaganda pieces.

You'd think it's an almost impossible number. I feel like you're about to hit me with some truth bomb. I mean, if you're trying to create controversy and you're trying to confuse people, you're gonna succeed. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha. There are a bunch of YouTube videos about it, but I find all of them either incorrect or incomplete. So in this video, I'm going to dive deeper and explain it fully. Here is the setup. Say there are 100 prisoners numbered one to 100. Slips of paper containing each of their numbers are randomly placed in 100 boxes in a sealed room. One at a time, each prisoner is allowed to enter the room and open any 50 of the 100 boxes, searching for their number. And afterwards, they must leave the room exactly as they found it, and they can't communicate in any way with the other prisoners. If all 100 prisoners find their own number during their turn in the room, they will all be freed. But if even one of them fails to find their number, they will all be executed. The prisoners are allowed to strategize before any of them goes into the room. So what is their best strategy? If they each search for their own number randomly, then each prisoner has a 50% chance of finding it. So the probability that all 100 prisoners find their numbers is 1 half times 1 half times 1 half 100 times, or 1 half to the power of 100. This is equal to.0000000030 zeros and then an 8. To put this probability into perspective, two people have a better chance of picking out the same grain of sand from all the beaches and deserts on Earth than by escaping this way. But what if I told you that with the right strategy, there's a way to raise their chances to nearly 1 in 3? It improves their odds over random chance by nearly 30 orders of magnitude. That's like taking a millimeter and scaling it up to the diameter of the observable universe. But they can only coordinate this strategy beforehand. Correct. Is this true? Yes. Teach me. This is not a trick question. The solution just involves an incredible feature of math. So what is this mathematical strategy? Well, if you don't already know the answer, feel free to pause the video here and try it for yourself. And if you don't come up with a solution, don't worry, you're in good company. Even the person who came up with this riddle, computer scientist Peter Brow-Milterson, he didn't even think of this strategy until a colleague pointed it out. Milterson ultimately published this problem in a paper where he generously left the solution as an exercise for the reader. So here is the solution. Pretend you are one of the prisoners. When you go into the room, open the box with your number on it. The number on the slip inside probably won't be yours, but that's okay. Go to the box with that number on it. Look at the number inside, then go to the box with that number on it, and so on. Keep doing this until you find the slip with your number. If you find your number, that essentially tells you to go back to the box where you started. It closes the loop of numbers you've been following. But if you've found your number, then you're done. You can stop and leave the room. This simple strategy gives over a 30% chance that all the prisoners will find their number. The entire pool has a 30. Everyone can find their number 31% of the time. What? But how does it work? The first thing to notice is that all boxes become part of a closed loop. The simplest loop would be a box that contains its own number. If you're a prisoner, number one and you go to box one, it contains slip one, then you're done. Your number was part of a loop of one. But you could also have a loop of two. Say box one points to box seven and box seven points back to box one. Or you could have a loop of three, or four, or five, or any length all the way up to 100. The longest loop you could have would connect all the numbers in a single loop. But more generally, any random arrangement of the slips in these boxes will result in a mixture of some shorter and some longer loops. When you start with a box labeled with your number, you are guaranteed to be on the loop that includes your slip. So the thing that determines whether or not you find your slip is the length of the loop. If your number is part of a loop that is shorter than 50, then you will definitely find your slip. But if your number is part of a loop that is shorter than 50, part of a loop that is 51 or longer, you're in trouble. You won't find it before you've exhausted the 50 boxes you're allowed to search. When you open the box labeled with your number, you are, in fact, starting at the farthest point on the loop from your slip. You want to know, where is the slip that points to this box? But to find it, you have to follow the loop of numbers all the way around to the end. That means if the prisoners follow this strategy and the longest loop is 51, not just one or two prisoners will fail to find their number, but all 51 on this loop won't make it. They make it to the box just before the box with their slip, but they have to stop searching there. So the probability that all of the prisoners succeed is just the probability that a random arrangement of 100 numbers contains no loops longer than 50. Now, I promised that this probability would come out to around one and three, but how do we calculate it? Well, imagine writing down all the different ways that you could connect 100 boxes to form a loop of length 100. So you could have box one points to box two, box two points to box three, to box four, and so on, all the way to 100, and then box 100 would point back to box one. Or you could have something random, box five points to box 99, to box 17, and so on, and let's pick the last one, is 63, and box 63 points back to box five. So how many different arrangements of these 100 boxes or permutations could you have? Well, for the first box, I have 100 different boxes that I could choose from. For the second box, because I've already used one, I can only pick from 99 boxes, and the next one I can pick from 98 boxes, and so on, down to the very last box, I don't really have a choice. There's only one box left I could put in the last position. So the total number of different permutations would be 100 times 99, times 98, times 97, all the way down to one. That is just 100 factorial. There are 100 factorial different ways that you could create a loop of 100 boxes. But what we can't forget is that these are not just lines of numbers, they are loops. So some of these lines that look different are actually the same loop. For example, two, three, four, five, and so on, up to 100 and then one, is the same thing as one, two, three, four, five, to 100. You can rearrange the way you write these numbers 100 different ways, but they all represent the same loop. So the total number of unique loops of length 100 is 100 factorial divided by 100. So what is the probability that any random arrangement of 100 boxes will contain a loop of length 100? Well, it's just equal to the number of unique such loops that we just calculated, 100 factorial over 100, divided by the total number of ways that you could put 100 slips in 100 boxes, which is 100 factorial. So the answer is 1 over 100. So there is a 1% chance that a random arrangement of slips results in a loop of length 100. And this is a general result. The probability that you get a loop of length 99 is 1 over 99. The probability that you get a loop of length 98 is 1 over 98. So the probability that there is a loop longer than 50 is 1 over 51 plus 1 over 52 plus 1 over 53, et cetera. Add all these up and it equals 0.69. There is a 69% chance of failure for the prisoners, meaning a 31% chance of success, where the longest loop is 50 or shorter. I still find it difficult to believe. This feels a bit like magic. Using the loop strategy, all the prisoners are more likely to find their numbers than even just two prisoners choosing at random. So using the loop strategy, what is the probability that each prisoner alone finds their number? It is still 50%. Each prisoner can still only open half the boxes, so their individual chance is still one half. But these probabilities are no longer independent of each other. Imagine running this experiment a thousand times over. If everyone is guessing randomly, you'd expect that on most runs around 50 prisoners would find their number. On lucky runs, the number would be a bit higher. On unlucky runs, a bit lower. But using the loop strategy, all of the prisoners would find their numbers 31% of the time. And 69% of the time, fewer than 50 find their number. The prisoners all win together, or the majority loses together. That's how this strategy works. Why are you assuming that your number will always be on the loop that you're on? I feel like- I understand that. This is a key question, right? Because I feel like it's possible to start and go on a complete loop and not come back to your own number because you got on the wrong loop and then you'd have to get on another loop. So I don't know that I buy this. Right, right, right, right, right, right. Now the big question everyone asks is, how do you know that if you start with a box with your number on it, you are guaranteed to be on the loop that contains your slip? Well, if you think about it, the slip that says 73, if anyone sees that, they will definitely go to the box with the number 73. So the slip and box with the same number essentially form a unit. They're like a little Lego brick. And then every slip is hidden inside another box. So as I start laying out slips and boxes randomly, you can see that there's no way that we can end up with a dead end. It's not like you can just get to a box and then stop because every box contains a slip and that points at another box. So the only way for you to see only boxes when you walk into the room is for every slip to be contained within a box. And that necessarily will mean that we are forming loops. So when I start with box 73, I must eventually find slip 73 because then and only then will I be directed to go back to box 73, which closes the loop. Who is the warden to this prison? What kind of sadistic mathematical warden are you dealing with here? This is awful. Now, what if there is a sympathetic prison guard who sneaks into the room before any of the prisoners go in? Well, then they can guarantee success for the prisoners by swapping the contents of just two boxes. That's because there can be at most one loop that is longer than 50 and you can break it in half just by swapping the contents of two boxes. And now I have two separate loops that are each shorter than 50. But what if there was a malicious guard who figured out that the prisoners were going to use this loop strategy? Well, then they could put the numbers in boxes to ensure they formed a loop longer than 50. In this case, are the prisoners doomed? Surprisingly, no. They can counter by arbitrarily renumbering the boxes. They could, for example, add five to each box number. The loops are set both by the locations of the slips and by the box numbers. Renumbering the boxes is essentially the same as redistributing the slips. So the problem is back to a random arrangement of loops, meaning the prisoners are back to their 31% chance of survival. Now, what happens if you increase the number of prisoners? Fun fact, nobody knows if, as you have more and more prisoners, it's going towards a limit or if it will eventually go down to zero or what. That is my friend, Matt Parker. And I think what he meant to say is we know exactly what happens as you increase the number of prisoners. With 1,000 prisoners, each allowed to check 500 boxes, you might expect their chance of success to drop dramatically. But you can calculate it like we did before and it comes out to 30.74%. Only half a percentage point lower than for 100 prisoners. For 1 million prisoners, the probability of success is 30.685%, which is only a little higher than for 1 billion. Of course, their bigger problem would be the time it takes to open all the boxes. So your probability of winning this game does indeed approach a limit. So what is that limit? The formula we've been using is one minus the chance of failure, which is the series 1 over 51 plus 1 over 52 and so on up to 1 over 100. We can depict this series as the sum of areas of rectangles. And there is a curve that follows the heights of these blocks. That curve is 1 over X. The area under that curve from 50 to 100 approximates the area of all the rectangles. And as the number of prisoners goes to infinity, it becomes a better and better approximation. So to find the probability of failure, we can just take the integral of 1 over X from N to 2N and we find that it's equal to the natural logarithm of two. This gives a probability of success of one minus the natural log of two, which is about 30.7%. The bottom line is that no matter how many prisoners you have, you'll always end up with above a 30% chance of escaping using this strategy. And that feels really wrong. I mean, at first it seemed essentially impossible for all 100 prisoners to find their numbers. But now we're seeing that you could have 100, a million, or any arbitrarily large number of prisoners with at least a 30% chance that they all find their numbers. The beauty of the loop strategy is linking everyone's outcomes together. Instead of each prisoner walking in with their own 50-50 shot, following the same loops means that they have the exact same chance of finding their number as everyone else in their loop. And once the boxes and slips are arranged, that chance is set at either 100% or 0%. With this strategy, you can't ever get close to winning with only a few people missing their numbers. You can only fail hard or succeed completely. Now, if you like solving puzzles, even outside of life-threatening prison situations, well, you'll love Brilliant, the sponsor of this video.

They're numbered 1, 2, 3, 4, and so on forever. This is the Hilbert Hotel, and you are the manager. Now, it might seem like you could accommodate anyone who ever shows up, but there is a limit. A way to exceed even the infinity of rooms at the Hilbert Hotel. To start, let's say only one person is allowed in each room, and all the rooms are full. There are an infinite number of people in an infinite number of rooms. Then, someone new shows up, and they want a room. But all the rooms are occupied, so what should you do? Well, a lesser manager might turn them away, but you know about infinity, so you get on the PA and you tell all the guests to move down a room. The person in room 1 moves to room 2, the one in room 2 moves to room 3, and so on down the line. And now, you can put the new guest in room 1. If a bus shows up with 100 people, you know exactly what to do. Just move everyone down 100 rooms and put the new guests in their vacated rooms. But now, say a bus shows up that is infinitely long, and it's carrying infinitely many people. You knew what to do with a finite number of people, but what do you do with infinite people? You think about it for a minute, and then come up with a plan. You tell each of your existing guests to move to the room with double their room number. So, the person in room 1 moves to room 2, room 2 moves to room 4, room 3 to room 6, and so on. And now, all of the odd-numbered rooms are available. And you know there are an infinite number of odd numbers, so you can give each person on the infinite bus a unique odd-numbered room. This hotel is really starting to feel like it can fit everybody, and that's the beauty of infinity. It goes on forever. And then, all of a sudden, more infinite buses show up. Not just one or two, but an infinite number of infinite buses. So, what can you do? Well, you pull out an infinite spreadsheet, of course. You make a row for each bus, bus 1, bus 2, bus 3, and so on, and a row at the top for all the people who are already in the hotel. The columns are for the position each person occupies. So, you've got hotel room 1, hotel room 2, hotel room 3, etc. And then, bus 1, seat 1, bus 1, seat 2, bus 1, seat 3, and so on. So, each person gets a unique identifier, which is a combination of their vehicle and their position in it. So, how do you assign the rooms? Well, start in the top left corner and draw a line that zigzags back and forth across the spreadsheet, going over each unique ID exactly once. Then, imagine you pull on the opposite ends of this line, straightening it out. So, we've gone from an infinite-by-infinite grid to a single infinite line. It's then pretty simple just to line up each person on that line with a unique room in the hotel. So, everyone fits, no problem. But now, a big bus pulls up, an infinite party bus with no seats. Instead, everyone on board is identified by their unique name, which is kind of strange. So, their names all consist of only two letters, A and B, but each name is infinitely long. So, someone is named A, B, B, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, A, and so on forever. Someone else is named A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, etc. On this bus, there's a person with every possible infinite sequence of these two letters. Now, A, B, B, A, A, A, A, A, I'll call him Abba for short. He comes into the hotel to arrange the rooms, but you tell him, sorry, there's no way we can fit all of you in the hotel. And he's like, what do you mean? There's an infinite number of us, and you have an infinite number of rooms. Why won't this work? So, you show him. You pull out your infinite spreadsheet again and start assigning rooms to people on the bus. So, you have room 1, assign it to Abba, and then room 2 to A, B, A, B, A, B, A, B, repeating. And you keep going, putting a different string of As and Bs beside each room number. Now, here's the problem, you tell Abba, let's say we have a complete infinite list. I can still write down the name of a person who doesn't yet have a room. The way you do it is you take the first letter of the first name and flip it from an A to a B. Then take the second letter of the second name and flip it from a B to an A. And you keep doing this all the way down the list, and the name you write down is guaranteed to appear nowhere on that list. Because it won't match the first letter of the first name, or the second letter of the second name, or the third letter of the third name. It will be different from every name on the list by at least one character, the letter on the diagonal. The number of rooms in the Hilbert Hotel is infinite, sure, but it is countably infinite. Meaning there are as many rooms as there are positive integers 1 to infinity. By contrast, the number of people on the bus is uncountably infinite. If you try to match up each one with an integer, you will still have people left over. Some infinities are bigger than others. So there's a limit to the people that you can fit in the Hilbert Hotel. This is mind-blowing enough, but what's even crazier is that the discovery of different sized infinities sparked a line of inquiry that led directly to the invention of the device you're watching this on right now. But that's a story for another time.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1052\n","\n","Link  320 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/5eW6Eagr9XA\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/5eW6Eagr9XA\n","[youtube] 5eW6Eagr9XA: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] 5eW6Eagr9XA: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 16.64MiB in 04:47\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Do you bring this trick out at parties? Oh no, it's a terrible party trick. Here we go. 3.141592653589793... This is Grant Guzman. He watched an old video of mine about how we think that there are two systems of thought. System 2 is the conscious, slow, effortful system. And system 1 is subconscious, fast and automatic. To explore how these systems work in his own head, Grant decided to memorize a hundred digits of pi. 3, 8, 4, 4, 6, 7... Then, he just kept going. He has now memorized 23,000 digits of pi in preparation to challenge the North American record. 3, 4, 5, 4, 9, 3, 0, 3, 8, 1, 9, 6. That's 200. Ha ha ha! That's amazing! I have wanted to make a video about experts for a long time. 4.1415926535897... This is Magnus Carlsen, the five-time world chess champion. He's being shown chessboards and asked to identify the game in which they occurred. This looks an awful lot like Tal Botvinnik. 4.1415926535897... Oops. This is the 24th game from Sevilla, obviously. Now I'm going to play through an opening and stop me when you recognize the game. And if you can tell me who was playing black in this one. Okay, sure. Okay. I'm sure you've seen this opening before. Okay, it's going to be Arnold. Against? Zabata. How can he do this? It seems like superhuman ability. Well, decades ago, scientists wanted to know what makes experts like chess masters special. Do they have incredibly high IQs? Much better spatial reasoning than average? Bigger short-term memory spans? Well, it turns out that as a group, chess masters are not exceptional on any of these measures. But one experiment showed how their performance was vastly superior to amateurs. In 1973, William Chase and Herbert Simon recruited three chess players. A master, an A player, who's an advanced amateur, and a beginner. A chess board was set up with around 25 pieces positioned as they might be during a game. And each player was allowed to look at the board for five seconds. Then they were asked to replicate the setup from memory on a second board in front of them. The players could take as many five-second peeks as they needed to get their board to match. From just the first look, the master could recall the positions of 16 pieces. The A player could recall 8, and the beginner only 4. The master only needed half the number of peeks as the A player to get their board perfect. But then the researchers arranged the board with pieces in random positions that would never arise in a real game. And now, the chess master performed no better than the beginner. After the first look, all players, regardless of rank, could remember the location of only three pieces. The data are clear. Chess experts don't have better memory in general, but they have better memory specifically for chess positions that could occur in a real game. The implication is, what makes chess masters special, is that they have seen lots and lots of chess games. And over that time, their brains have learned patterns. So rather than seeing individual pieces at individual positions, they see a smaller number of recognizable configurations. This is called chunking. What we have stored in long-term memory allows us to recognize complex stimuli as just one thing. For example, you recognize this as pi rather than a string of six unrelated numbers, or meaningless squiggles for that matter. There's a wonderful sequence I like a lot, which is 30173, which to me means Stephen Curry number 30, 173 games, which is the record back in 2016. So 30173. At its core, expertise is about recognition. Magnus Carlsen recognizes chess positions the same way we recognize faces. And recognition leads directly to intuition. If you see an angry face, you have a pretty good idea of what's going to come next. Chess masters recognize board positions and instinctively know the best move. Most of the time, I know what to do. I don't have to figure it out. To develop the long-term memory of an expert takes a long time. 10,000 hours is the rule of thumb popularized by Malcolm Gladwell. But 10,000 hours of practice by itself is not sufficient. There are four additional criteria that must be met. And in areas where these criteria aren't met, it's impossible to become an expert. So the first one is many repeated attempts with feedback. Tennis players hit hundreds of forehands in practice. Chess players play thousands of games before their grandmasters. And physicists solve thousands of physics problems. Each one gets feedback. The tennis player sees whether each shot clears the net and is in or out. The chess player either wins or loses the game. And the physicist gets the problem right or wrong. But some professionals don't get repeated experience with the same sorts of problems. Political scientist Philip Tetlock picked 284 people who make their living commenting or offering advice on political and economic trends. This included journalists, foreign policy specialists, economists, and intelligence analysts. Over two decades, he peppered them with questions like, would George Bush be reelected? Would apartheid in South Africa end peacefully? Would Quebec secede from Canada? And would the dot com bubble burst? In each case, the pundits rated the probability of several possible outcomes. And by the end of the study, Tetlock had quantified 82,361 predictions. So how did they do? Pretty terribly. These experts, most of whom had postgraduate degrees, performed worse than if they had just assigned equal probabilities to all the outcomes. In other words, people who spend their time and earn their living studying a particular topic produce poorer predictions than random chance. Even in the areas they knew best, experts were not significantly better than non-specialists. The problem is most of the events they have to predict are one-offs. They haven't had the experience of going through these events or very similar ones many times before. Even presidential elections only happen infrequently and each one in a slightly different environment. So we should be wary of experts who don't have repeated experience with feedback. The next requirement is a valid environment. One that contains regularities that make it at least somewhat predictable. A gambler betting at the roulette wheel, for example, may have thousands of repeated experiences with the same event. And for each one, they get clear feedback in the form of whether they win or lose. But you would rightfully not consider them an expert because the environment is low validity. A roulette wheel is essentially random, so there are no regularities to be learned. In 2006, legendary investor Warren Buffett offered to bet a million dollars that he could pick an investment that would outperform Wall Street's best hedge funds over a 10-year period. Hedge funds are pools of money that are actively managed by some of the brightest and most experienced traders on Wall Street. They use advanced techniques like short selling, leverage, and derivatives in an attempt to provide outsized returns, and consequently, they charge significant fees. One person took Buffett up on the bet. Ted Cides of Protege Partners. For his investment, he selected five hedge funds. Well, actually, five funds of hedge funds. So in total, a collection of over 200 individual funds. Warren Buffett took a very different approach. He picked the most basic, boring investment imaginable. A passive index fund that just tracks the weighted value of the 500 biggest public companies in America, the S&P 500. They started the bet on January 1st, 2008, and immediately things did not look good for Buffett. It was the start of the global financial crisis and the market tanked. But the hedge funds could change their holdings and even profit from market falls. So they lost some value, but not as much as the market average. The hedge funds stayed ahead for the next three years, but by 2011, the S&P 500 had pulled even. And from then on, it wasn't even close. The market average surged, leaving the hedge funds in the dust. After 10 years, Buffett's index fund gained 125.8% to the hedge funds 36%. Now, the market performance was not unusual over this time. At 8.5% annual growth, it nearly matches the stock market's long run average. So why did so many investment professionals with years of industry experience, research at their fingertips, and big financial incentives to perform fail to beat the market? Because stocks are a low-validity environment. Over the short term, stock price movements are almost entirely random. So the feedback, although clear and immediate, doesn't actually reflect anything about the quality of the decision making. It's closer to a roulette wheel than to chess. Over a 10-year period, around 80% of all actively managed investment funds fail to beat the market average. And if you look at longer time periods, underperformance rises to 90%. And before you say, well, that means 10% of managers have actual skill, consider that just through random chance, some people would beat the market anyway. Portfolios picked by cats or throwing darts have been shown to do just that. And in addition to luck, there are nefarious practices, from insider trading to pump and dump schemes. Now, I don't mean to say there are no expert investors. I mean, Warren Buffett himself is a clear example. But the vast majority of stock pickers and active investment managers do not demonstrate expert performance because of the low validity of their environment. Brief side note, if we know that stock picking will usually yield worse results over the long term and that what active managers charge in fees is rarely compensated for in improved performance, then why is so much money invested in individual stocks, mutual funds and hedge funds? Well, let me answer that with a story. There was an experiment carried out with rats and humans, where there's a red button and a green button that can each light up. 80% of the time, the green button lights up and 20% of the time, the red button lights up, but randomly. So you can never be sure which button will light. And the task for the subject, either rat or human, is to guess beforehand which button will light up by pressing it. For the rat, if they guess right, they get a bit of food and if they guess wrong, a mild electric shock. The rat quickly learns to press only the green button and accept the 80% win percentage. Humans on the other hand, usually press the green button, but once in a while, they try to predict when the red light will go on and as a result, they guess right only 68% of the time. We have a hard time accepting average results and we see patterns everywhere, including in randomness, so we try to beat the average by predicting the pattern. But when there is no pattern, this is a terrible strategy. Even when there are patterns, you need timely feedback in order to learn them. And YouTube knows this, which is why within the first hour after posting a video, they tell you how its performance compares to your last 10 videos. There's even confetti fireworks when the video is number one. I know it seems like a silly thing, but you have no idea how powerful a reward this is and how much YouTuber effort is spent chasing this supercharged dopamine hit. To understand the difference between immediate and delayed feedback, psychologist Daniel Kahneman contrasts the experiences of anesthesiologists and radiologists. Anesthesiologists work alongside the patient and get feedback straight away. Is the patient unconscious with stable vital signs? With this immediate feedback, it's easier for them to learn the regularities of their environment. Radiologists, on the other hand, don't get rapid feedback on their diagnoses. If they get it at all, this makes it much harder for them to improve. Radiologists typically correctly diagnose breast cancer from x-rays just 70% of the time. Delayed feedback also seems to be a problem for college admissions officers and recruitment specialists. After admitting someone to college or hiring someone at a big company, you may never or only much later find out how they did. This makes it harder to recognize the patterns in ideal candidates. In one study, Richard Melton tried to predict the grades of freshmen at the end of their first year of college. A set of 14 counselors interviewed each student for 45 minutes to an hour. They also had access to high school grades, several aptitude tests, and a four-page personal statement. For comparison, Melton created an algorithm that used as input only a fraction of the information, just high school grades and one aptitude test. Nevertheless, the formula was more accurate than 11 of the 14 counselors. Melton's study was reported alongside over a dozen similar results across a variety of other domains, from predicting who would violate parole to who'd succeed in pilot training. If you've ever been denied admission to an educational institution or turned down for a job, it feels like an expert has considered your potential and decided that you don't have what it takes to succeed. I was rejected twice from film school and twice from a drama program, so it's comforting to know that the gatekeepers at these institutions aren't great predictors of future success. So if you're in a valid environment and you get repeated experience with the same events, with clear, timely feedback for each attempt, will you definitely become an expert in 10,000 hours or so? The answer, unfortunately, is no. Because most of us want to be comfortable. For a lot of tasks in life, we can become competent in a fairly short period of time. Take driving a car, for example. Initially, it's pretty challenging. It takes up all of system two, but after 50 hours or so, it becomes automatic. System one takes over and you can do it without much conscious thought. After that, more time spent driving doesn't improve performance. If you wanted to keep improving, you would have to try driving in challenging situations like new terrain, higher speeds, or in difficult weather. Now, I have played guitar for 25 years, but I'm not an expert because I usually play the same songs. It's easier and more fun. But in order to learn, you have to be practicing at the edge of your ability, pushing beyond your comfort zone. You have to use a lot of concentration and methodically, repeatedly attempt things you aren't good at. You can practice everything exactly as it is and exactly as it's written, but at just such a speed that you have to think about and know exactly where you are and what your fingers are doing and what it feels like. This is known as deliberate practice. And in many areas, professionals don't engage in deliberate practice so their performance doesn't improve. In fact, sometimes it declines. If you're experiencing chest pain and you walk into a hospital, would you rather the doctor is a recent graduate or someone with 20 years experience? Researchers have found that diagnostic skills of medical students increase with their time in medical school, which makes sense. The more cases you've seen with feedback, the better you are at spotting patterns. But this only works up to a point. When it comes to rare diseases of the heart or lungs, doctors with 20 years experience were actually worse at diagnosing them than recent graduates. And that's because they haven't thought about those rare diseases in a long time, so they're less able to recognize the symptoms. Only after a refresher course could the doctors accurately diagnose these diseases. And you can see the same effect in chess. The best predictor of skill level is not the number of games or tournaments played, but the number of hours dedicated to serious, solitary study. Players spend thousands of hours alone learning chess theory, studying their own games and those of others. And they play through compositions, which are puzzles designed to help you recognize tactical patterns. In chess, as in other areas, it can be challenging to force yourself to practice deliberately. And this is why coaches and teachers are so valuable. They can recognize your weaknesses and assign tasks to address them. To become an expert, you have to practice for thousands of hours in the uncomfortable zone attempting the things you can't do quite yet. True expertise is amazing to watch. To me, it looks like magic, but it isn't. At its core, expertise is recognition. And recognition comes from the incredible amount of highly structured information stored in long-term memory. To build that memory requires four things. A valid environment, many repetitions, timely feedback, and thousands of hours of deliberate practice. When those criteria are met, human performance is astonishing. And when it's not, you get people we think of as experts who actually aren't. If you want to become a STEM expert, you have to actively interact with problems. That's what you can do with Brilliant, the sponsor of this video. Check out this course on computer science, where you can uncover the optimal strategy for finding a key in a room. And you quickly learn how your own strategy can be replicated in a neural network. Magic is another great course that I find challenges me mentally. You go from thinking you understand something to actually getting it. And if it feels difficult, that's a good thing. It means you're getting pushed outside your comfort zone. This is how Brilliant facilitates deliberate practice. And if you ever get stuck, a helpful hint is always close at hand. So don't fall into the trap of just getting comfortable and doing what you know how to do. Build in the habit of being uncomfortable and regularly learning something new. That is the way to lifelong learning and growth. So I invite you to check out the courses over at brilliant.org slash Veritasium. And I bet you will find something there that you want to learn.

Well, the nearest star to Earth, of course, is the Sun, and it is not going to explode. But if it had eight times the mass, then it would go supernova at the end of its life. So what would that look like? Well, as noted by XKCD, if you held up a hydrogen bomb right to your eyeball and detonated it, that explosion would still be a billion times less bright than watching the Sun go supernova from Earth. That's how insanely powerful supernova explosions are. They are the biggest explosions in the universe. When we see supernovae in other galaxies, they are brighter than the combined light of hundreds of billions of stars. So bright, in fact, that they appear to come out of nowhere. On the 8th of October, 1604, the astronomer Johannes Kepler looked up into the night sky and noticed a bright star he had never seen before. It was brighter than all the other stars in the sky, and about as bright as the planet Jupiter. On moonless nights, it was bright enough to cast a shadow. Kepler published his observations of this star in a book called De Stellanova, which means about a new star in Latin. Kepler thought he was witnessing the birth of a new star, but it was actually a star's violent death. Over the following year and a half, the light faded until it was no longer visible. But the name stuck. Even once we learned what was really happening in the 1930s, the violent final explosion for stars between about 8 and 30 solar masses has been called a supernova. But how exactly a star explodes is not what most people think. For most of a star's life, it exists in a stable balance. In its core, it fuses lighter elements together to make heavier ones, and in the process, it converts a small amount of matter into energy. This energy is really what keeps the star from collapsing in on itself. Gravity compresses the star, but that force is counteracted by the pressure generated by the movement of particles inside the star, and by the pressure of photons released by fusion. So, in effect, stars are propped up by their own light. If the rate of fusion drops at the center of the star, the temperature and the pressure decrease. Gravity starts winning, compressing the star. But this increases the temperature and pressure in the core, which increases the rate of fusion. It's a stable, self-regulating system. But there's a problem. Stars have a finite amount of fuel, which, over time, gets used up. Our sun is about 5 billion years into its 10 billion year lifespan. There are stars dozens of times more massive than the sun, which you would think would live much longer. But they actually use up their nuclear fuel faster. A star 20 times the mass of our sun has a lifespan of just 10 million years. And more massive stars burn hotter and even brighter, but for much shorter lives. For 90% the life of a star, the core is only hot enough to fuse hydrogen into helium. And when the hydrogen runs out, fusion slows, gravity compresses the core, and its temperature increases to 200 million degrees, at which point helium fuses into carbon. There's enough helium to power the star for around a million years. But as the helium runs out, the core is again compressed and heated. Carbon starts fusing into neon, which lasts about a thousand years. And then neon fuses into oxygen for a few more years, then oxygen to silicon for a few months. And at 2.5 billion degrees, silicon fuses into nickel, which decays into iron. Now at the heart of this giant star, there is an iron core building that's only a few thousand kilometers across. Iron is where this pattern stops. Instead of liberating energy as it fuses into heavier elements, it actually requires energy. Iron is the most stable element, so it actually takes energy both to fuse it into heavier elements, and to break it down into lighter ones. Both fusion and fission reactions ultimately end up at iron. The iron core grows, but the crush of gravity becomes greater and greater as the rate of fusion drops. When the iron core is about 1.4 times the mass of our Sun, which is known as the Chandrasekhar limit, the pull of gravity is so strong that something totally wild happens. Quantum mechanics takes over. Electrons run out of room to move, and they're forced into their lowest energy states. They then become absorbed by the protons in the nucleus. In this process, the protons turn into neutrons and release neutrinos. With the electrons gone, the core collapses, and fast, at about 25% the speed of light. So what used to be a ball of iron 3,000 kilometers in diameter becomes a ball of neutrons just 30 kilometers across. Essentially, it's a neutron star. With no outward pressure to hold it up, the rest of the star caves in, also falling at a quarter the speed of light. It hits the neutron star and bounces off, creating a huge pressure wave. But this kinetic energy isn't quite enough to start a supernova explosion. No, the thing that really kicks it off is the humble neutrino. Now, I normally think of neutrinos as particles that do basically nothing. I mean, they interact so rarely with matter that right now there are a hundred trillion neutrinos passing through your body per second. It would take a light year of lead just to give you a 50-50 chance of stopping a neutrino. And that's because they interact only through gravity and the weak force. But in a supernova, when the electrons are captured by the protons, an unbelievable number of neutrinos is released, around 10 to the 58. You would think they would just fly off at nearly the speed of light, but the core of a supernova is incredibly dense. About 10 trillion times more dense than lead. And as a result, it traps some of those neutrinos and captures their energy. And this is what makes a star go supernova. A particle that is millions of times less massive than an electron, that barely interacts with anything, is responsible for some of the largest explosions in the universe. In that explosion, only a hundredth of 1% of the energy is released as electromagnetic radiation, the light that we can see. Even then, supernova have enough energy to outshine a whole galaxy. About 1% of the energy is released as the kinetic energy of the exploding matter, but the vast majority of the energy is released in the form of neutrinos. And neutrinos are actually the first signal we detect from supernovae. And that's because after they're generated in the core, they can escape before the shock wave reaches the surface, where the light that we see is generated. So neutrinos can arrive on Earth hours before the photons, giving astronomers a chance to aim their telescopes at the right part of the sky. I actually used to work at a neutrino observatory back in college, and I would work the graveyard shift between midnight and 8am. So if I detected a really big increase in the neutrino flux during my shift, it was my job to call and wake up scientists so they could go look out for a supernova. Now that never actually happened, but we did have some close calls. Now I need to clarify a couple things. First, not all really massive stars explode. As they collapse, some form black holes instead, which means they do not go supernova. And second, there's another way to make a supernova. Sometimes a white dwarf star, which is incredibly dense, pulls matter off a nearby star. And when its mass reaches that Chandrasekhar limit of 1.4 solar masses, the white dwarf collapses, creating a supernova. This is actually the type of supernova that Kepler saw in 1604, a supernova 20,000 light years from Earth. Now, because the shocks are asymmetric, supernova explain neutron stars that can move really fast. There's a neutron star we've observed with a velocity of 1,600 kilometers per second. And we think that was caused by a very asymmetric supernova explosion, sent it shooting off in the other direction. Despite only recently learning about how supernovae work, humans have been observing them for thousands of years. Ancient Indian, Chinese, Arabic, and European astronomers all observed supernovae. But they are quite rare. In a galaxy like our Milky Way, consisting of 100 billion stars, there are only about one or two supernovae per century. A particularly amazing example is the supernova of 1054, when the light of a supernova 6,500 light years away reached the Earth and was recorded by Chinese astronomers. If we look to where that supernova was recorded, we see the Crab Nebula. It is a giant remnant of radioactive matter left behind by the explosion. In the thousand years since the explosion, the remnant has grown to 11 light years in diameter. Supernovas produce a lot of cosmic rays. Cosmic rays are actually particles, mainly protons and helium nuclei, and they travel out at very, very nearly the speed of light, have a tremendous amount of energy. So at what distance could a supernova cause problems for life on Earth? The closest stars to us, besides the Sun, are the three stars in Alpha Centauri. They are 4.4 light years away. But stars do move around, and on average, a star gets within one light year of Earth every 500,000 years. So what would happen if such a star went off? Yeah, so within a light year, you're easily within a danger distance from just the kinetic energy. So I think even at that distance, you're looking at possibly blowing the atmosphere off. But we would also have other problems to worry about. Supernovae create conditions that are hot enough to fuse elements heavier than iron. In the months after the explosion, these elements undergo radioactive decay, producing gamma rays and cosmic rays. Less than 0.1% of the energy produced by a supernova is emitted as gamma rays from these radioactive decays. But even this tiny percentage can be dangerous. At a few light years from a supernova, the radiation could be deadly, though most of it would be blocked by our atmosphere. Now, the Earth is protected from solar and cosmic radiation by our atmosphere, and specifically by ozone molecules, three oxygen atoms bonded together. But high-energy cosmic rays from supernovae can come down and break apart nitrogen molecules in the atmosphere. And then these bond with oxygen atoms, which can then break apart ozone. And so we can lose a lot of our ozone if there's too many cosmic rays coming from supernova events. And that can expose us to all kinds of dangerous radiation coming in from space. We actually see an increase in atmospheric NO3 concentrations coinciding with supernova explosions. A supernova within 30 light years is rare, only happening maybe once every one and a half billion years or so. But a recent article suggests supernovae could be lethal all the way out to 150 light years away. And so those would be much more common. We actually have evidence for a supernova that went off 150 light years from Earth 2.6 million years ago. It would have been seen by our early human ancestors, like Australopithecus. And we know this because there are elements present on Earth that could only have been deposited by a recent supernova. In sedimentary rocks at the bottom of the Pacific Ocean, scientists have found traces of Iron 60 in a layer that was deposited 2.6 million years ago. Iron 60 is an isotope of iron, with four more neutrons than the most common type of iron. Iron 60 is really hard to make. Our sun doesn't make it, nor is it produced basically anywhere else in the solar system. Iron 60 is made basically exclusively in supernova explosions. And iron 60 is radioactive. It has a half-life of 2.6 million years. So every 2.6 million years, half of the sample decays into cobalt 60. So all of the iron 60 that was around during the formation of the Earth 4.5 billion years ago has definitely decayed. So the iron 60 that the scientists measure is proof of a recent supernova. Scientists also measured trace amounts of manganese 53 in the same sediments, giving further evidence supporting the idea that recently there was an explosion of a nearby supernova. The supernova that happened 2.6 million years ago wasn't catastrophic for our ancestors, but some researchers hypothesized that it could be related to the mass extinction which is seen at the Pliocene-Pleistocene boundary in the fossil record around the same time. This extinction wiped out around a third of marine megafauna. The idea is that the cosmic rays from the supernova hit particles in our atmosphere, creating muons, which are charged particles like the electron only more than 200 times heavier. The muon flux for years after the supernova would have been 150 times higher than normal. And the bigger the animal, the larger the radiation dose it would have received from these muons, which is why megafauna were so disproportionately affected. And what's more, the animals that lived in shallower waters were more likely to become extinct compared to the ones that lived at depth, where the water would have protected them from muons. Further evidence for these recent nearby supernovae comes from our place in the galaxy. You know, if you look in the space between the stars in our galaxy, on average there are around a million hydrogen atoms per cubic meter. That may sound like a lot, but it's basically a perfect vacuum. But for hundreds of light years in all directions around our solar system, you find that there are a thousand times fewer hydrogen atoms. It's like they've all been blown out somewhere, and our solar system is existing in this cosmic void inside a low-density bubble. So that is evidence for maybe tens of supernovae that would have blown all this material outwards. But there are cosmic explosions that are even more deadly than normal supernovae. Gamma-ray bursts. Gamma-ray bursts were discovered by the Vela satellites, which were looking for Soviet nuclear tests. But on the 2nd of July, 1967, the satellites detected a large burst of gamma rays, which were coming from space. There are two main sources of gamma-ray bursts, mergers of neutron stars and the core collapses of gigantic stars called hypernovae. Hypernovae are caused by stars that are at least 30 solar masses and rapidly spinning. Their collapse leads to an explosion 10 times more powerful than a regular supernova, and it leaves behind a black hole. The gamma-ray bursts caused by hypernovae channel most of their energy into beams, which are just a few degrees across. If there was a gamma-ray burst within 6,000 light-years, it would decrease the ozone level enough that it could be catastrophic. To put this distance in context, a sphere with a radius of 6,000 light-years contains hundreds of millions of stars. On October 9th, 2022, astronomers detected one of the most powerful gamma-ray bursts ever measured. It was powerful enough to measurably affect how the ionosphere bounces radio waves. The effect on the ionosphere was around the same as a solar flare. But this gamma-ray burst was located in a galaxy 2.5 billion light-years away. Astronomers speculate that a gamma-ray burst could have caused the late Ordovician mass extinction, which wiped out 85% of marine species 440 million years ago. There is no direct evidence, but gamma-ray bursts are common enough that it is estimated that there has been a 50% chance that there was an ozone-removing, extinction-causing GRB in the vicinity of Earth in the last 500 million years. So if a supernova or a gamma-ray burst were to go off near the Earth now, that would be pretty catastrophic. But in an ironic twist, we kind of owe our existence to these sorts of explosions. Because 4.6 billion years ago, it was probably the shockwave from a nearby supernova, which triggered the collapse of a cloud of gas and dust that gradually coalesced to form our solar system. So the Sun, the Earth, and all of us wouldn't be here today without the explosions of nearby stars. Figuring out how supernova explode was incredibly difficult. It took a combination of astrophysics, particle physics, computer science, and mathematics.

Imagine you have a giant circuit consisting of a battery, a switch, a light bulb, and two wires which are each 300,000 kilometers long. That is the distance light travels in one second. So they would reach out halfway to the moon and then come back to be connected to the light bulb which is one meter away. Now the question is, after I close this switch, how long would it take for the bulb to light up? Is it half a second, one second, two seconds, one over C seconds, or none of the above? Now you have to make some simplifying assumptions about this circuit, like the wires have to have no resistance, otherwise this wouldn't work, and the light bulb has to turn on immediately when current passes through it. But I want you to commit to an answer and put it down in the comments so you can't say, oh yeah, I knew that was the answer when I tell you the answer later on. This question actually relates to how electrical energy gets from a power plant to your home. Unlike a battery, the electricity in the grid comes in the form of alternating current or AC, which means electrons in the power lines are just wiggling back and forth. They never actually go anywhere. So if the charges don't come from the power plant to your home, how does the electrical energy actually reach you? When I used to teach this subject, I would say that power lines are like this flexible plastic tubing, and the electrons inside are like this chain. So what a power station does is it pushes and pulls the electrons back and forth 60 times a second. Now at your house, you can plug in a device like a toaster, which essentially means allowing the electrons to run through it. So when the power station pushes and pulls the electrons, well, they encounter resistance in the toaster element, and they dissipate their energy as heat, and so you can toast your bread. Now this is a great story, I think it's easy to visualize, and I think my students understood it. The only problem is it's wrong. For one thing, there is no continuous conducting wire that runs all the way from a power station to your house. No, there are physical gaps, there are breaks in the line, like in transformers, where one coil of wire is wrapped on one side, a different coil of wire is wrapped on the other side, so electrons cannot possibly flow from one to the other. Plus, I mean, if it's the electrons that are carrying the energy from the power station to your device, then when those same electrons flow back to the power station, why are they not also carrying energy back from your house to the power station? I mean, if the flow of current is two ways, then why does energy only flow in one direction? These are the lies you were taught about electricity, that electrons themselves have potential energy, that they are pushed or pulled through a continuous conducting loop, and that they dissipate their energy in the device. My claim in this video is that all of that is false. So how does it actually work? In the 1860s and 70s, there was a huge breakthrough in our understanding of the universe. When Scottish physicist James Clerk Maxwell realized that light is made up of oscillating electric and magnetic fields. The fields are oscillating perpendicular to each other and they are in phase, meaning when one is at its maximum, so is the other wave. Now he works out the equations that govern the behavior of electric and magnetic fields and hence these waves, those are now called Maxwell's equations. But in 1883, one of Maxwell's former students, John Henry Pointing, is thinking about conservation of energy. Now, if energy is conserved locally in every tiny bit of space, well, then you should be able to trace the path that energy flows from one place to another. So think about the energy that comes to us from the sun. I mean, during those eight minutes when the light is traveling, the energy is stored and being transmitted in the electric and magnetic fields of the light. Now, Pointing works out an equation to describe energy flux. That is how much electromagnetic energy is passing through an area per second. This is known as the pointing vector and it's given the symbol S. And the formula is really pretty simple. It's just a constant, one over mu naught, which is the permeability of free space, times E cross B. Now E cross B is the cross product of the electric and magnetic fields. Now the cross product is just a particular way of multiplying two vectors together, where you multiply their perpendicular magnitudes and to find the direction, you put your fingers in the direction of the first vector, which in this case is the electric field, and curl them in the direction of the second vector, the magnetic field, then your thumb points in the direction of the resulting vector, the energy flux. So what this shows us about light is that the energy is flowing perpendicular to both the electric and the magnetic fields. And it's in the same direction as the light is traveling. So this makes a lot of sense. Light carries energy from its source out to its destination. But the kicker is this. Poinnting's equation doesn't just work for light. It works any time there are electric and magnetic fields coinciding. Anytime you have electric and magnetic fields together, there is a flow of energy and you can calculate it using Poinnting's vector. To illustrate this, let's consider a simple circuit with a battery and a light bulb. The battery by itself has an electric field, but since no charges are moving, there is no magnetic field. So the battery doesn't lose energy. When the battery is connected into the circuit, its electric field extends through the circuit at the speed of light. This electric field pushes electrons around so they accumulate on some of the surfaces of the conductors, making them negatively charged and are depleted elsewhere, leaving their surfaces positively charged. These surface charges create a small electric field inside the wires, causing electrons to drift preferentially in one direction. Note that this drift velocity is extremely slow, around a tenth of a millimeter per second. But this is current. Well, conventional current is defined to flow opposite the motion of electrons, but this is what's making it happen. The charge on the surfaces of the conductors also creates an electric field outside the wires. And the current inside the wires creates a magnetic field outside the wires. So now there is a combination of electric and magnetic fields in the space around this circuit. So according to Poynting's theory, energy should be flowing. And we can work out the direction of this energy flow using the right-hand rule. Around the battery, for example, the electric field is down and the magnetic field is into the screen. So you find the energy flux is to the right, away from the battery. In fact, all around the battery, you'll find the energy is radially outwards. Energy is going out through the sides of the battery into the fields. Along the wires, again, you can use the right-hand rule to find the energy is flowing to the right. This is true for the fields along the top wire and the bottom wire. But at the filament, the Poynting vector is directed in toward the light bulb. So the light bulb is getting energy from the field. If you do the cross product, you find the energy is coming in from all around the bulb. It takes many paths from the battery to the bulb, but in all cases, the energy is transmitted by the electric and magnetic fields. People seem to think that you're pumping electrons and that you're like buying electrons or something, which is just so wrong. For most people, and I think to this day, it's quite counterintuitive to think that the energy is flowing through the space around the conductor. But the energy, which is traveling through the field, yeah, is going quite fast. So there are a few things to notice here. Even though the electrons go two ways, away from the battery and towards it, by using the Poynting vector, you find that the energy flux only goes one way, from the battery to the bulb. This also shows it's the fields and not the electrons that carry the energy. I mean, how far do the electrons go in this little thing you're talking about? They barely move, they probably don't move at all. Now, what happens if in place of a battery, we use an alternating current source? Well then, the direction of current reverses every half cycle. But this means that both the electric and magnetic fields flip at the same time. So at any instant, the Poynting vector still points in the same direction, from the source to the bulb. So the exact same analysis we used for DC, still works for AC. And this explains how energy is able to flow from power plants to homes in power lines. Inside the wires, electrons just oscillate back and forth. Their motion is greatly exaggerated here, but they do not carry the energy. Outside the wires, oscillating electric and magnetic fields travel from the power station to your home. You can use the Poynting vector to check that the energy flux is going in one direction. You might think this is just an academic discussion, that you could see the energy as transmitted either by fields or by the current in the wire, but that is not the case. And people learned this the hard way when they started laying undersea telegraph cables. The first transatlantic cable was laid in 1858. It only worked for about a month, it never worked properly. There are all kinds of distortions when they tried to send. Enormous amounts of distortion. I mean, they could work it at a few words per minute. What they found was sending signals over such a long distance under the sea, the pulses became distorted and lengthened. It was hard to differentiate dots from dashes. To account for the failure, there was a debate among scientists. William Thompson, the future Lord Kelvin, thought electrical signals moved through submarine cables like water flowing through a rubber tube. But others like Heveside and Fitzgerald argued it was the fields around the wires that carried the energy and information. And ultimately this view proved correct. To insulate and protect the submarine cable, the central copper conductor had been coated in an insulator and then encased in an iron sheath. The iron was only meant to strengthen the cable, but as a good conductor, it interfered with the propagation of electromagnetic fields because it increased the capacitance of the line. This is why today most power lines are suspended high up. Even the damp earth acts as a conductor. So you want a large insulating gap of air to separate the wires from the ground. So what is the answer to our giant circuit light bulb question? Well, after I close the switch, the light bulb will turn on almost instantaneously in roughly one over C seconds. So the correct answer is D. I think a lot of people imagine that the electric field needs to travel from the battery all the way down the wire, which is a light second long. So it should take a second for the bulb to light up. But what we've learned in this video is it's not really what's happening in the wires that matters. It's what happens around the wires. And the electric and magnetic fields can propagate out through space to this light bulb, which is only one meter away in a few nanoseconds. And so that is the limiting factor for the light bulb turning on. Now, the bulb won't receive the entire voltage of the battery immediately. It'll be some fraction, which depends on the impedance of these lines and the impedance of the bulb. Now I asked several experts about this question and got kind of different answers, but we all agreed on these main points. So I'm gonna put their analysis in the description in case you want to learn more about this particular setup. If I get called out on it and people don't think it's real, we can definitely invest the resources and string up some lines and make our own power lines in the desert. You're gonna get called out on it. I agree, I think you're gonna get called out. You're gonna get called out. I think that's right. I think it's just kind of wild that this is one of those things that we use every day that almost nobody thinks about or knows the right answer to. These traveling electromagnetic waves around power lines are really what's delivering your power. Hey, now that you understand how electrical energy actually flows, you can think about that every time you flick on a light switch.

Using mirrors, lights, and lasers, they can illuminate the tiniest differences in air temperature and density, and track how drug powder settles in the rooms of a house, determine which person fired a gun, or spot particles escaping from a sealed package. A portion of this video was sponsored by Caseta by Lutron. Our best tool for picking up trace substances has been the same for centuries. So it turns out nature has already provided us with the best chemical detector, and that is the dog's nose. So this is Bubbles. She's a 3D printed, anatomically correct model of a female Labrador Retriever. We tried to get one of the police canines to come in here and get in front of the mirror, but dogs get hungry and cranky very quickly, and we got about four seconds of good footage. And I'm like, okay, we can do better than this. And dogs can sniff very faint scents and from far away, but they don't do it just by breathing in. What they do is breathe out and in rapidly, around five times a second. What I want you to notice is this pulsating motion by the, by the, we'll call it the doggy treat. Right? This is our doggy treat. If you notice this pulsating motion. And what allows them to detect scents from far away is the rapid and turbulent exhale. When the dog exhales, there's a turbulent air jet that comes out of each nostril. Just like when you and I exhale, you put your hand under here and just exhale out of your nose. Those are two turbulent air jets coming out of the dog's nose. But when the dog is down on the ground, those air jets are vectored back towards its rear. The dog is pushing air back and by doing that, it's pulling air from ahead of it. So imagine me, I'm blowing air this way. And when I do that, I actually reach out and pull air towards me. The dog reverses flow, inhales, right? Gets a new sample, analyzes it with an amazing chemical detector upstairs, right? It's olfactory region and does it at five times a second. The, on average, a dog when it's sniffing for something, five times a second, repetitive sine wave. So that's what makes the dog this incredible sampling system. It kind of didn't matter the breed of dog. So somehow their evolution allowed them to figure out, okay, one over five seconds is what I need before I take the next puff, the next inhale. If the dog had an infinite lung capacity and it just inhaled constantly, it has a very limited reach. But because of this in and out bellows effect, its reach goes up by roughly a factor of 18. Because we actually, we have a number of commercially available vapor detectors, okay? Some of these are really good for various explosives and drugs. Some are very good for chemical and biological hazards. But they all just inhale air. What we did is we designed and printed what are essentially nostrils that plug onto this thing and make it sniff like a dog. And then by doing a set of controlled experiments by moving your vapor source farther and farther, we were able to, on average, improve the detection capabilities of these by roughly a factor of 16 to 18. Just by making them sniff like a real dog. We're able to see this dog breath using Schlieren imaging. I've actually done a video on this before. This is an automotive headlamp. After that, I have a condenser lens. So it takes this light and focuses it down to a point. So from there, our light diverges and it comes up and it fills our mirror. Think of these light beams as arrows, okay? And there are a bunch of arrows that are coming up. They're straight as can be. But when they pass something of a different refractive index, which could be the heat from my hand or different density, which could be a gas of a different density, those light rays, they shift a little bit. They shift very slightly, okay? They refract, they bend. Then they all come back. So we're coming back here and right here we have a two-way mirror. So light can travel through the mirror this way, but when it comes back, it turns 90 degrees. And if you look right here, I have a razor blade. And what this is doing, it is positioned exactly at the focal point of that mirror. I have that razor blade edge. It's able to move in and out of the focal plane. And so what I do is I cut off those arrows of light, those beams of light that shifted a little bit, and I cut them off. I block them. As I move the knife edge out, so I'm not cutting off any light right now, so you basically have a really expensive mirror. It's not doing anything for you. But as I take this razor blade and push it in, you start to see, you know, turbulence in the air. And as I take it more and more, yeah, there you go. Get your hand in there. Whoa. Your Schlieren setup is so much better than mine. So take a look at this. So this is in a Shattograph system. So it's Schlieren's little brother, okay? It's not a Schlieren system, but it's very close. It's a Shattograph. Shattograph is not as sensitive, okay, but it's easier to build. Look, we have a flashlight and a white wall, and we're already seeing a Shattograph there. So why does this work? What's happening is we have light. It's not as focused as I would like, but the more focused the better. The light's coming up this way. It's passing through a hot flame of a different density and refractive index. And we're basically casting a shadow of that plume on the wall, which is why it's called a Shattograph. These can still be used to visualize flow patterns in detail. Just by looking at the footage of guns fired in a Shattograph, we can actually figure out the speed of the bullet and how loud the bang was. And there's our bullet whizzing off. It is supersonic because it has a very small bow shock. You see it there? Very, very small. So it's, you know, roughly Mach 1.05 maybe, just above sonic. Compare that to the infamous AK-47 assault rifle. There's two things that we can qualitatively observe here. One is if you compare these side to side, the Smith & Wesson versus the AK-47, the darkness of this line is different. This is a quieter firearm. It's not as loud. The report is not as loud. It's less pronounced. It's less pronounced. Yep. The hot gases released when the gun is fired expand outwards, creating a shockwave. Across this shock, the pressure, temperature, and density of the air changes rapidly. And the bigger that change, the darker this shows up in the Shattograph. So you can get a sense of how loud it is by how dark that shock appears. And then here we see our bullet whizzing off at about, oh gosh, Mach 2, 2.5. You could actually measure that and calculate the Mach number. Any object moving through air creates pressure waves that travel out at the speed of sound. Since this bullet is moving faster than the speed of sound, the pressure waves it creates all get compressed together into a single conical shockwave. It's like a tiny sonic boom. And you can use this to determine the speed of the bullet. The sine of the angle is the ratio of the speed of sound to the speed of the object. There is a different way to visualize flow, which is with a laser sheet. It illuminates fine particles so we can see the plumes of gunpowder residue created when the gun is fired. We call this laser light sheet. And the reason is, okay, so now our light's there. I can barely see it because I have laser safety glasses on. I can only see it in the camera. Yeah. So what's happening here is we have a laser beam and we send it, we steer it through a cylindrical glass rod. All it is is a piece of glass that's a cylinder. And what that does is it spreads that beam into a two-dimensional wall of laser light. Okay. And so the way this works is whenever particles or theatrical fog cross through this sheet, they light up because of the laser. There's a lot of effort now going into understanding gunshot residue. So gunshot residue is the kind of burned and unburned propellant that occurs whenever a firearm is discharged. Right. So what we're looking at here is using laser lights and high-speed cameras is we're looking at the plume of gunshot residue that's generated after a firing event. Looking, this is looking at ventilation inside an actual gun range. But look at all this. This is all gunshot residue that you can't see with the naked eye, but it's there. So you can imagine if you're inside a home, this is five shots in a few seconds, enormous amounts of material. A lot of this is landing on the hands of the shooter. But unfortunately, a lot of it is also being dispersed into the local environment. It goes way farther than I expected. So the question is, can we differentiate between something that's actually been done by the shooter and something, say, by a bystander that walked in two minutes later? So that this is what we're actively trying to pursue right now. So these are tools and techniques that we use here at NIST that are qualitative or sometimes semi-quantitative, but they really help illustrate what's happening. And then the public security part of this deals with trace contraband detection. We're all generating heat, right? So we all have this warm plume of air. You want to see it? I'll show you. It's kind of crazy. So you see it there. So that is called the human thermal plume. And guess what's in that plume? Water? Parts of me. Skin cells. No way. Yeah. So we're shedding skin cells at a pretty creepy rate. I forget what the number is, but it's a lot. Thousands an hour-ish. So we are shedding these skin cells constantly. And it's actually not necessarily a bad thing from a trace detection standpoint. What do you mean? Well, whenever we are talking about trace detection, whether it's drugs or explosives, it's all based on this fundamental principle. It's called low-carb exchange principle. It's in forensic science. It's that every contact leaves a trace. And what that means is when you're done in this lab, there will be parts of you left behind in this lab, whether you like it or not, right? Because we're all shedding skin cells and taking things, taking stuff with us. So if I'm a bomb maker, if I'm involved in manufacturing, you know, illegal fentanyl in my basement, I am ultimately contaminating myself with the bulk material. And this contamination comes in the form of very, very small particles. And the chemical detection systems that we have available now are so sensitive, they can detect a single particle of, say, an explosive residue. Imagine you have a bomb in a package, right? And you're at some kind of screening facility, right? You're at a facility that maybe is screening things coming in from overseas. Maybe you've got a sniffer. You've got a commercially available vapor detector. And you've got 10 seconds to sample this package. Where do you point your device? Right? These are the kinds of experiments that help us understand where you should point your device. We call this burping. We're burping the package. So we have some acetone in here. So wherever you burp it, where you squeeze it, you have acetone vapor coming out of all the gaps, right? So they're coming out in the gaps. So that gap gives you the highest chance of actually detecting what's inside, right? You don't want to go over here where there's no gaps. You don't want to go up there where there's no gap. You want to go in these corners here where stuff is actually kind of permeating through and outside of the box. This is some recent work we're doing. We are basically simulating illicit drug manufacturing. So here's some talc powder, right? The big deal, I'm going to shake it up a little bit. When I open this and squeeze, I can't see anything. But are you seeing anything in the camera? Yes. So again, to the naked eye, we'd never be able to see this. But because the laser is doing the illuminating for us, we're able to see this. Let's do a little experiment where I am taking a legal substance A and pouring it into substance B. First thing I'll do, just watch when I take the lid off of this. Take it from here. There's a little bit coming off. Oh yeah, it's still going. So just imagine you're in a basement and you're building stuff like this. And you don't realize that there's all this contamination spreading and landing on other surfaces in your room. And I can't talk about the numbers, but they're pretty startling. Like there's a lot. It spreads everywhere. There's a lot, yeah. A pool of smoke in here. You ready? Yep. What I really love about the laser sheet technique is it allows you to visualize the turbulence that's in the air. So this is a way we can see how the airflow in the room is actually being tracked. Oh, that's nice. Yep. If you look at the graph in the top right, that is actually real-time counts. Of the particles that are being generated around this person. So that plot represents basically inhalation exposure of the materials that he's working with. That's crazy if you think about it. Because if that's fentanyl and that person doesn't have a mask on, they're gone. We add fluorescent powder to this kind of stuff so we can actually visualize where the contamination goes. The other cool part of this is that we can use a quantitative method to actually visualize where the contamination goes. We can use a quantitative method of sampling surfaces in the house. We basically use swabbing. It's the same idea when you go to the airport. You ever gone there and they ask for your hands? And they take a little swab and they wipe your hands. What they're doing is they're looking for these trace amounts of explosive particles that could be on you if you were involved in the manufacture of an explosive device. But that's a drone. That's looking at a drone. The question is, because you get this cool prop wash and these four propellers that are all interacting with each other. So the question is, can we use the fluid dynamics of a drone to do the sampling for us? Here's what I mean by that. If there is a suspected manufacturing facility of something, say it's a methamphetamine or fentanyl, it's very, very expensive to get hazmat crews involved, have them come. They have to gown up, they have to go in to a potentially really dangerous situation. What if we had a drone? We just flew the drone in, right? It buzzes around and it's got some special kind of collector on the belly of the drone. And we're using the prop wash of the drone to stir up particles off of the surface and then somehow inhale them, collect them. The drone comes back to base. You run your chemical analysis. You say, OK, the house is clean or no, we found stuff. OK, now it's time to pull out the hazmat crew. So the big picture idea that I want you to keep in the back of your head the whole time is this idea of public safety and security. So that's really what happens in this lab. But underneath that kind of umbrella term, think mask research. So when the COVID pandemic hit, we kind of switched gears in here to try to address some of the issues related to masks. This thing will actually breathe as a human does. That human happens to be me. So I measured my own kind of breathing rate and then built a system, kind of engineered a pneumatic system that replicates that. But it also has a fog machine, a fog generator. So this thing basically just looks like it took a drag off of the cigarette and exhaled. What's kind of cool with this is it looks like there's nothing coming through, right? But there is millions and millions of particles trying to make it through. Some do because it's not 100 percent. So I wrote an image processing code. So you take this information, you plug it into a code, and it analyzes based on pixels and it's counting white pixels. And sure enough, if you use an N95, you put an N95 on here, you run it through an image processing code. Guess what percentage of pixels light up white? Five percent. Five percent. OK. I just want you to breathe naturally. So when you're inhaling, it gets dark and when you're exhaling, it gets lighter because the air is being warmed by your lungs and then coming back out. Like it's interesting how fast you can see the effect of the breathing in, like, like just makes it go dark. But that shows me that like this doesn't change color at all. So this is being used to seal versus filter. I noticed that color change is a lot more dramatic. With this, you know, it was it was in and out. I feel like it's a that's a thinner mask, right? Yeah. So the heat transfer through it is going to be greater. I feel like there's a lot coming out over the top. Yeah, there's a lot. If you just breathe naturally, you'll see a lot come out there. The thing with masks, right, is like initially they were like, masks don't work. Don't wear a mask. And then they were like, masks do work like and wear a cloth mask. And then they were like, no, no, cloth masks don't work. Like, I know there was a lot of confusion around masks. What we learned early on was that the communication of, you know, mask effectiveness could have been improved. Right. And so that's kind of why I did what we did with the Schlieren. The truth is, the average American is not going to sit down and read a scientific journal article. But they will sit down and watch a 90 second video of me coughing with a mask on and off. And that's that's what we did. It's kind of a unique relationship we have with other federal agencies here. So you have a three letter agency that has a specific need for something right in the security arena. What they'll often do is they'll come here to NIST and they'll say, hey, we're really interested in sampling people's shoes for explosives for whatever reason. Right. So what we do here and in this lab in particular is we figure out what are some good ways to sample shoes for explosives. What are some not so good ways? Right. What do the measurements need to look like to evaluate a shoe sampling system doesn't even exist yet. And then what do the standards need to look like that support those measurements? Right. And so we figure all this stuff out in the lab, package it up nice and neat, give it back to the sponsoring agency. And then they take it to industry and industry already has a leg up on the development of these kinds of systems because we did a lot of the heavy lifting here in the lab. Because with the success of, you know, doing the covid related visualization, we're realizing now that the application space for this kind of technology is huge. Indoor air quality. We can imagine a bigger mirror where we could look at two people interacting with each other and what that transfer looks like from one person to the other. The take home message is flow visualization is a critical tool that we use here at NIST to really help understand what's happening. Right. It's one thing to do quantitative analysis on various surfaces, but now we can see we can actually see what's happening and where these particles are generated.

And with the sponsor of this video, Caseta by Lutron, you can easily set up your own perfect lighting. You know, Caseta provides premium smart lighting control, including switches, remotes and plug in smart dimmers, which allow you to customize your home lighting from anywhere in the house. What I love about smart switches is that one switch can control many regular bulbs, so you can effectively make all your bulbs smart just by replacing the switch. And installation is easy. First, make sure you turn off power to the switch and then disconnect the existing wires and connect them to Caseta's smart switch. If you need any help, they're just a click or a call away. Then with the smart hub, you can turn your lights on and off just using your phone or you can use another device like Alexa or Google Assistant. Caseta works with more smart home brands than any other smart lighting control system. Plus, their switches don't rely on Wi-Fi, so they always stay connected and you always have control over your lights. I personally like setting timers in my house. For example, the lights in my office turn on by themselves in the evening. And this gives me peace of mind that my family will always come home to a well-lit house. And the best part of it all is if I'm already in bed, I can just check which lights are still on and turn them off without having to run around the house.

This video is about a pattern people thought was impossible, and a material that wasn't supposed to exist. The story begins over 400 years ago in Prague. I'm now in Prague, in the Czech Republic, which is perhaps my favorite European city that I've visited so far. I'm going to visit the Kepler Museum, because he's one of the most famous scientists who lived and worked around Prague. I want to tell you five things about Johannes Kepler that are essential to our story. Number one. Kepler is most famous for figuring out that the shapes of planetary orbits are ellipses. But before he came to this realization, he invented a model of the solar system in which the planets were on nested spheres, separated by the platonic solids. What are the platonic solids? Well, they are objects where all of the faces are identical, and all of the vertices are identical. Which means you can rotate them through some angle, and they look the same as they did before. So the cube is an obvious example. Then you also have the tetrahedron, the octahedron, the dodecahedron, which has 12 pentagonal sides, and the icosahedron, which has 20 sides. And that's it. There are just five platonic solids. Which was convenient for Kepler because in his day they only knew about six planets. So this allowed him to put a unique platonic solid between each of the planetary spheres. Essentially, he used them as spacers. He carefully selected the order of the platonic solids so that the distances between planets would match astronomical observations as closely as possible. He had this deep abiding belief that there was some geometric regularity in the universe. And of course there is, just not this. Two. Kepler's attraction to geometry extended to more practical questions like, how do you stack cannonballs so they take up the least space on a ship's deck? By 1611, Kepler had an answer. Hexagonal close packing and the face-centered cubic arrangement are both equivalently and optimally efficient with cannonballs occupying about 74% of the volume they take up. Now this might seem like the obvious way to stack spheres. I mean, it is the way that oranges are stacked in the supermarket. But Kepler hadn't proved it. He just stated it as fact, which is why this became known as Kepler's conjecture. Now it turns out he was right. But it took around 400 years to prove it. The formal proof was only published in the journal Form of Mathematics in 2017. Three. Kepler published his conjecture in a pamphlet called Deneva Sixangula, on the six-cornered snowflake, in which he wondered, there must be a definite cause why, whenever snow begins to fall, its initial formations invariably display the shape of a six-cornered starlet. For if it happens by chance, why do they not fall just as well with five corners or with seven? Why always with six? In Kepler's day, there was no real theory of atoms or molecules or how they self-arrange into crystals. But Kepler seemed to be on the verge of understanding this. I mean, he speculates about the smallest natural unit of a liquid like water, essentially a water molecule, and how these tiny units could stack together mechanically to form the hexagonal crystal. Not unlike the hexagonal close-packed cannonballs. Four. Kepler knew that regular hexagons can cover a flat surface perfectly, with no gaps. In mathematical jargon, we say the hexagon tiles the plane periodically. You know that a tiling is periodic if you can duplicate a portion of it and continue the pattern only through translation, with no rotations or reflections. Periodic tilings can also have rotational symmetry. A rhombus pattern has twofold symmetry because if you rotate it 180 degrees, one half turn, the pattern looks the same as it did before. Equilateral triangles have threefold symmetry. Squares have fourfold symmetry. And hexagons have sixfold symmetry. But those are the only symmetries you can have. Two, three, four, and six. There is no fivefold symmetry. Regular pentagons do not tile the plane. But that didn't stop Kepler from trying. See this pattern right here? He published it in his book Harmonikis Mundi, or Harmony of the World. It has a certain fivefold symmetry. But not exactly. And it's not entirely clear how you would continue this pattern to tile the whole plane. There are an infinite number of shapes that can tile the plane periodically. The regular hexagon can only tile the plane periodically. There are also an infinite number of shapes that can tile the plane periodically or non-periodically. For example, isosceles triangles can tile the plane periodically, but if you rotate a pair of triangles, well then the pattern is no longer perfectly periodic. A Sphinx tile can join with another, rotate it at 180 degrees, and tile the plane periodically. But a different arrangement of these same tiles is non-periodic. This raises the question, are there some tiles that can only tile the plane non-periodically? Well, in 1961, Hao Wang was studying multicolored square tiles. The rules were touching edges must be the same color, and you can't rotate or reflect tiles, only slide them around. Now the question was, if you're given a set of these tiles, can you tell if they will tile the plane? Wang's conjecture was that if they can tile the plane, well they can do so periodically. But it turned out Wang's conjecture was false. His student Robert Berger found a set of 20,426 tiles that could tile the plane, but only non-periodically. Think about that for a second. Here we have a finite set of tiles, okay it's a large number, but it's finite, and it can tile all the way out to infinity without ever repeating the same pattern. There's no way even to force them to tile periodically. And a set of tiles like this that can only tile the plane non-periodically is called an aperiodic tiling. And mathematicians wanted to know, were there aperiodic tilings that required fewer tiles? Well Robert Berger himself found a set with only 104. Donald Knuth got the number down to 92. And then in 1969 you had Raphael Robinson who came up with six tiles, just six, that could tile the entire plane without ever repeating. Then along came Roger Penrose, who would ultimately get the number down to two. Penrose started with a pentagon. He added other pentagons around it and of course noticed the gaps. But this new shape could fit within a larger pentagon, which gave Penrose an idea. What if he took the original pentagons and broke them into smaller pentagons? Some of the gaps start connecting up into rhombus shapes, other gaps have three spikes. But Penrose didn't stop there, he subdivided the pentagons again. Now some of the gaps are large enough that you can use pentagons to fill in part of them. And the remaining holes you're left with are just rhombuses, stars, and a fraction of a star that Penrose calls a justice cap. You can keep subdividing indefinitely and you will only ever find these shapes. So with just these pieces you can tile the plane aperiodically with an almost five-fold symmetry. The fifth thing about Johannes Kepler is that if you take his pentagon pattern and you overlay it on top of Penrose's, the two match up perfectly. Once Penrose had his pattern, he found ways to simplify the tiles. He distilled the geometry down to just two tiles, a thick rhombus and a thin rhombus. The rules for how they can come together can be enforced by bumps and notches or by matching colors. The rules ensure that these two single tiles can only tile the plane non-periodically. Just two tiles go all the way out to infinity without ever repeating. Now one way to see this is to print up two copies of the same Penrose pattern and one on a transparency and overlay them on top of each other. Now the resulting interference you get is called a moire pattern. Where it is dark, the patterns are not aligned. But you can see there are also some light spots and that's where the patterns do match up. And as I rotate around, you can see the light spots move in and get smaller and then at a certain point they move out and get bigger. And what I want to do is try to enlarge one of these bright spots and see how big of a matching section I can find. Oh yes! Yes! It's like all of a sudden everything is illuminated. I love it! So these patterns are perfectly matching up here, here, here, here, and here, but not along these radial lines. And that is why they look dark. So what this shows us is that you can't ever match any section perfectly to one beneath it. There will always be some difference. So my favorite Penrose pattern is actually made out of these two shapes which are called kites and darts. And they have these very particular angles. The way they are meant to match up is based on these two curves. You can see there is a curve on each piece and so you have to connect them so that the curves are continuous. And that's the rule that allows you to build an aperiodic tiling from these two pieces. So I laser cut thousands of these pieces and I'm going to try to put them together and make a huge Penrose tiling. Oh man. Come on. If you stare at a pattern of kites and darts, you'll start to notice all kinds of regularities like stars and suns. But look closer and they don't quite repeat in the way you'd expect them to. These two tiles create an ever-changing pattern that extends out to infinity without repeating. Does this mean there is only one pattern of kites and darts and every picture that we see is just a portion of that overall singular pattern? Well the answer is no. There are actually an uncountably infinite number of different patterns of kites and darts that tile the entire plane. And it gets weirder. If you were on any of those tilings, you wouldn't be able to tell which one it is. I mean you might try to look further and further out, gather more and more data, but it's futile because any finite region of one of these tilings appears infinitely many times in all of the other versions of those tilings. I mean don't get me wrong, those tilings are also different in an infinite number of ways, but it's impossible to tell that unless you could see the whole pattern, which is impossible. There's this kind of paradox to Penrose tilings where there's an uncountable infinity of different versions, but just by looking at them, you could never tell them apart. Now, what if we count up all the kites and darts in this pattern? Well I get 440 kites and 272 darts. Does that ratio ring any bells? Well if you divide one by the other, you get 1.618. That is the golden ratio. So why does the golden ratio appear in this pattern? Well as you know, it contains a kind of five-fold symmetry, and of all the irrational constants, the golden ratio phi is the most five-ish of the constants. I mean you can express the golden ratio as 0.5 plus 5 to the power of 0.5 times 0.5. The golden ratio is also heavily associated with pentagons. I mean the ratio of the diagonal to an edge is the golden ratio, and the kite and dart pieces themselves are actually sections of pentagons, same with the rhombuses. So they actually have the golden ratio built right into their construction. The fact that the ratio of kites to darts approaches the golden ratio, an irrational number, provides evidence that the pattern can't possibly be periodic. If the pattern were periodic, then the ratio of kites to darts could be expressed as a ratio of two whole numbers, the number of kites to darts in each periodic segment. And it goes deeper. If you draw on the tiles, not curves, but these particular straight lines, well now when you put the pattern together, you see something interesting. They all connect up perfectly into straight lines. There are five sets of parallel lines. This is a kind of proof of the five-fold symmetry of the pattern. But it is not perfectly regular. Take a look at any one set of parallel lines. You'll notice there are two different spacings, call them long and short. From the bottom we have long, short, long, short, long, long. Wait, that breaks the pattern. These gaps don't follow a periodic pattern either. But count up the number of longs and shorts in any section. Here I get 13 shorts and 21 longs. And you have the Fibonacci sequence, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, and so on. And the ratio of one Fibonacci number to the previous one approaches the golden ratio. Now the question Penrose faced from other scientists was, could there be a physical analog for these patterns? Do they occur in nature, perhaps in crystal structure? Penrose thought that was unlikely. The very nature of a crystal is that it is made up of repeating units. Just as the fundamental symmetries of the shapes that tile the plane had been worked out much earlier, the basic unit cells that compose all crystals were well established. There are 14 of them, and no one had ever seen a crystal that failed to fit one of these patterns. And there was another problem. Crystals are built by putting atoms and molecules together locally. Whereas Penrose tilings, well, they seem to require some sort of long range coordination. Take this pattern, for example. You could put a dart over here and continue to tile out to infinity, no problems. Or you could put a kite over here on the other side, again, no problems. But if you place the kite and dart in here simultaneously, well, then this pattern will not work. I mean, you can keep tiling for a while, but when you get to somewhere around here, well, it's not going to work. You can put a dart in there, which completes the pattern nicely. But then you get this really awkward shape there, which is actually the shape of another dart. But if you put that one in there, then the lines don't match up. The pattern doesn't work. So how could this work as a crystal? I mean, both of these tiles obey the local rules, but in the long term, they just don't work. In the early 1980s, Paul Steinhardt and his students were using computers to model how atoms come together into condensed matter, that is essentially solid material at the smallest scales. And he found that locally, they like to form icosahedrons. But this was known to be the most forbidden shape because it is full of fivefold symmetries. So the question they posed was, how big can these icosahedrons get? They thought maybe 10 atoms or 100 atoms. But inspired by Penrose tilings, they designed a new kind of structure, a 3D analog of Penrose tilings now known as a quasicrystal. And they simulated how X-rays would diffract off such a structure, and they found a pattern with rings of 10 points reflecting the fivefold symmetry. Just a few hundred kilometers away, completely unaware of their work, another scientist, Dan Schectman, created this flaky material from aluminum and manganese. And when he scattered electrons off his material, this is the picture he got. It almost perfectly matches the one made by Steinhardt. So if Penrose tilings require long-range coordination, then how do you possibly make quasicrystals? Well, I was talking to Paul Steinhardt about this, and he told me if you just use the matching rules on the edges, those rules are not strong enough. And if you apply them locally, you run into problems like this. You misplace tiles. But he said if you have rules for the vertices, the way the vertices can connect with each other, those rules are strong enough locally so that you never make a mistake and the pattern can go on to infinity. One of the seminal papers on quasicrystals was called Deneva quinquangula on the pentagonal snowflake in a shout out to Kepler. Now, not everyone was delighted at the announcement of quasicrystals, a material that up until then people thought totally defied the laws of nature. Double Nobel Prize winner Linus Pauling famously remarked, there are no quasicrystals, only quasi-scientists. Burr. But Schectman got the last laugh. He was awarded the Nobel Prize for chemistry in 2011. And quasicrystals have since been grown with beautiful dodecahedral shapes. They are currently being explored for applications from non-stick electrical insulation and cookware to ultra-durable steel. And the thing about this whole story that fascinates me the most is what exists that we just can't perceive because it's considered impossible? I mean, the symmetries of regular geometric shapes seemed so obvious and certain that no one thought to look beyond them. That is, until Penrose. And what we found are patterns that are both beautiful and counterintuitive, and materials that existed all along that we just couldn't see for what they really are.

For 2,000 years the most successful method was painstakingly slow and tedious. But then Isaac Newton came along and changed the game. You could say he speed ran pie, and I'm going to show you how he did it. But first, pie with pizzas. Cut the crust off a pizza and lay it across identical pizzas. And you'll find that it goes across three and a bit pizzas. This is pie. The circumference of a circle is roughly 3.14 times its diameter. But pie is also related to a circle's area. Area is just pi r squared. But why is it pi r squared? Well, cut a pizza into really thin slices and then form these slices into a rectangle. Now the area of this rectangle is just length times width. The length of the rectangle is half the circumference, because there's half the crust on one side and half on the other. So the length is pi r. And then the width is just the length of a piece of pizza, which is the radius of the original circle. So area is pi r times r. Area is pi r squared. So the area of a unit circle then is just pi. Keep that in mind because it'll come in handy later. So what was the ridiculous way we used to calculate pi? Well, it's sort of the most obvious way. It's easy to show that pi must be between three and four. Take a circle and draw a hexagon inside it with sides of length one. A regular hexagon can be divided into six equilateral triangles. So the diameter of the circle is two. Now the perimeter of the hexagon is one. Now the perimeter of the hexagon is six. And the circumference of the circle must be larger than this. So pi must be greater than six over two. So pi is greater than three. Now draw a square around the circle. The perimeter of the square is eight, which is bigger than the circle's circumference. So pi must be less than eight over two. So pi is less than four. This was actually known for thousands of years. And then in 250 BC, Archimedes improved on the method. So first he starts with the hexagon just like you did. And then he bisects the hexagon to a dodecagon. So that's a 12-sided, regular 12-sided shape. And he calculates its perimeter. The ratio of that perimeter to the diameter will be less than pi. He does the same thing for a circumscribed 12-gon and finds an upper bound for pi. The calculations now become a lot more tricky because he has to extract square roots and square roots of square roots and turn all these into fractions. But he works out the 12-gon and then the 24-gon, 48-gon. And by the time he gets to the 96-gon, he's sort of had enough. But he gets, in the end, he gets pi to between 3.1408 and 3.1429. So for over 2000 years ago, that's not too bad. Yeah, that seems like all the precision you'd need in pi. Right, so this goes way beyond precision for any practical purpose. This is now a matter of flexing your muscles. You know, this is showing off just how much mathematical power you have that you can work out a constant like pi to very high precision. So for the next 2000 years, this is how everyone carried on. Bissecting polygons to dizzying heights. As pi passed through Chinese, Indian, Persian, and Arab mathematicians, each contributed to these bounds along Archimedes' line. And in the late 16th century, Frenchman François Viet doubled a dozen more times than Archimedes, computing the perimeter of a polygon with 393,216 sides. Only to be outdone at the turn of the 17th century by the Dutch Ludolf van Koehlen. He spent 25 years on the effort, computing to high accuracy the perimeter of a polygon with 2 to the 62 sides. That is 4 quintillion, 611 quadrillion, 686 trillion, 18 billion, 427 million, 387,904 sides. What was the reward for all of that hard work? Just 35 correct decimal places of pi. He had these digits inscribed on his tombstone. 20 years later, his record was surpassed by Christoph Grienberger, who got 38 correct decimal places. But he was the last to do it like this? Pretty much, yeah. Because shortly thereafter, we get Sir Isaac Newton on the scene. And once Newton introduces his method, nobody is bisecting n-gons ever again. The year was 1666, and Newton was just 23 years old. He was quarantining at home due to an outbreak of bubonic plague. Newton was playing around with simple expressions like 1 plus x all squared. You can multiply it out and get 1 plus 2x plus x squared. Or what about 1 plus x all cubed? Well again, you can multiply out all the terms and get 1 plus 3x plus 3x squared plus x cubed. And you could do the same for 1 plus x to the 4 or 1 plus x to the 5 and so on. But Newton knew there was a pattern that allowed him to skip all the tedious arithmetic and go straight to the answer. If you look at the numbers in these equations, the coefficients on x and x squared and so on, well, they're actually just the numbers in Pascal's Triangle. The power that 1 plus x was raised to corresponds to the row of the triangle. Right, and Pascal's Triangle is really easy to make. It's something that's been known from ancient Greeks and Indian mythology. Ancient Greeks and Indians and Chinese, Persians, a lot of different cultures discovered this. All you do is whenever you have a row, you just add the two neighbors and that gives you the value of the row below it. So that's a really quick, easy thing. You can compute the coefficients for 1 plus x to the 10 in a second instead of sitting there doing all the algebra. The thing that fascinated me when I started looking at those old documents was how even, like I don't speak those languages, I don't know those number systems. And yet it is obvious, it is clear as day that they are all writing down the same thing, which today in the Western world we call Pascal's Triangle. That's the beauty of mathematics. It transcends culture, it transcends time, it transcends humanity. It's going to be around well after we're gone and ancient civilizations, alien civilizations will know Pascal's Triangle. Over time, people worked out a general formula for the numbers in Pascal's Triangle. So you can calculate the numbers in any row without having to calculate all the rows before it. For any expression 1 plus x to the n, it is equal to 1 plus n times x plus n times n minus 1 x squared on 2 factorial plus n times n minus 1 times n minus 2 times x cubed on 3 factorial and so on. And that's the binomial theorem. So binomial because there's only two terms, 1 and x, by is 2, there's two nomials. And a theorem is that this is a theorem that you can rigorously prove that this formula is exactly what you'll see as the coefficients in Pascal's Triangle. So all of this was known in Newton's day already. Yeah, exactly. Everybody knew this, everybody saw this formula. And yet nobody thought to do with it the thing that Newton did with it, which is to break the formula. The standard binomial theorem insists that you apply it only when n is a positive integer, which makes sense, right? This whole thing is about working out 1 plus x times itself a certain number of times. But Newton says, screw that, just apply the theorem. I mean, math is about finding patterns and then extending them and trying to find out where they break. So he tries 1 plus x to the negative 1. So that's 1 over 1 plus x. What happens if I just blindly plug in n equals negative 1 for the right hand side of the formula? And what you get is the terms alternate back and forth, plus 1 minus 1, plus 1 minus 1, and so on forever. So that's 1 minus x, the next term will be a plus x squared, the next term will be a minus x cubed, plus x to the fourth, minus x to the fifth, so that's just alternating series with plus and minus signs as the coefficients. So it becomes an infinite series. Yeah, that's right. If you don't have a positive integer, the Newton's binomial theorem will give you an infinite sum. But how do you understand that? Like for all positive integers, it was just a finite set of terms, and now we've got an infinite set of terms. Yeah, so what happens is if you have a positive integer, you remember that formula, the coefficient looks like n times n minus 1 times n minus 2 and so on. When you get to n minus n, if n is a positive integer, you will eventually get there, and n minus n is 0. So that coefficient and all the coefficients after it are all 0, and that's why it's just a finite sum, it's a finite triangle. But once you get outside of the triangle with positive integers, you never hit n minus n because n is not a positive integer. So you get this infinite series. So I think the big question is, does this actually work? Does Newton's infinite series actually give you the value of 1 over 1 plus x? Right, and it might be nonsense. There's lots of math formulas that break completely when you do this, right? We have rules for a reason, but we should always know the extent to which the rules have a chance of working farther. If you take that whole series and you multiply it by 1 plus x, and you multiply all that out, you'll see all the terms cancel except that leading 1. And so that big series times 1 plus x is 1. In other words, that big series is 1 over 1 plus x. That's how Newton justified to himself that it makes sense to apply the formula where it shouldn't be applicable. So Newton is convinced the binomial theorem works even for negative values of n, which means there's more to Pascal's triangle. Above the 0th row, you could add a 0 and a 1 that add to make that first 1, and then that row would continue minus 1, plus 1, minus 1, plus 1, all the way out to infinity. And you know, outside the standard triangle, the implied value everywhere is 0. And this fits with that. The alternating plus and minus 1s add to make 0 everywhere in the row beneath them. And you can extend the pattern for all negative integers, either using the binomial theorem or just looking at what numbers would add together to make the numbers underneath. And here's something amazing. If you ignore the negative signs for a minute, these are the exact same numbers arranged in the same pattern as in the main triangle. The whole thing has just been rotated on its side. But Newton doesn't stop with the integers. Next, he tries fractional powers like 1 plus x to the half. So now what does it mean you take 1 plus x to the one half? Well, that's the same thing as square root of 1 plus x. And he wants to understand, does that have the same expansion? Putting n equals a half into the binomial theorem, he gets an infinite series. That makes me think that we could actually go into Pascal's triangle, blow it up, and add fractions in between the rows that we're familiar with. Exactly. There's even a continuum of Pascal's triangles. Between 0 and 1, there's this, you know, a continuum of numbers that you could put in for powers. You can think of each fraction, like a half, a quarter, a third, as existing in its own plane, where in each plane, pairs of numbers add to make the number beneath them. N doesn't have to be a positive integer anymore. Doesn't have to be a positive integer, doesn't have to be a negative integer, doesn't have to be an integer. So now we're going to take n to be a half, and he works this thing out, and then he could do all kinds of things. For example, he could work out the square root of 3 very quickly and efficiently, because the square root of 3, we can write 3 as 4 minus 1, and if we pull out a 4, then we get a square root of 4, which is just 2, times the square root of 1 minus a quarter. If you put in minus a quarter for x in this series, you'll get a very rapidly converging series expansion that will quickly give you square root of 3 to high accuracy. Now Newton is particularly interested in n equals a half, because the equation for a unit circle is x squared plus y squared equals 1. And if you solve for y, well, the top part of the circle is equal to 1 minus x squared to the half. This is basically the same expression he's been looking at. He just has to replace x by minus x squared, which adds in some minus signs and doubles the power of x on each term. But now he's got an equation for a circle where each term is just a rational number times x raised to some power. Now we have two different ways of representing the same thing. And whenever you have something like that, magic is about to happen. Fireworks is about to go off. But how does he use this to calculate pi? Well, luckily for us, he had just invented calculus, or what he called the theory of fluxions. He realizes that if you integrate under that curve as x goes from 0 to 1, you're getting the area under the curve, which is a quarter circle. And he knows that the area of a unit circle is exactly pi r squared, except r is 1, so the area is pi. And we want just a quarter, so the area is pi over 4. On the other side, he has this nice series, and he knows how to integrate x to some power. You just increase each power of x by 1 and divide by the new power. And now you have an infinite series of terms which just involve simple arithmetic with fractions. You put in x equals 1, and you can calculate pi to an arbitrarily high precision. But Newton goes even further, adding one final tweak. A not good math paper has zero ideas. It's just pushing through things that everybody already knows, but nobody bothered to do. Then there are good math papers that have like one new idea that's like really shockingly new. Newton's on new idea number four at this point, and he's about to have new idea number five. And new idea number five is instead of integrating from 0 to 1, he's going to integrate just from 0 to a half. You know, when you have an infinite series, you want the terms to decrease in size as fast as possible. That way you don't have to calculate as many of them to get a pretty good answer. And Newton sees if he integrates not from 0 to 1, but from 0 to a half, then when he subs in a half for x, each term will shrink in size by an additional factor of x squared, which in this case is a quarter. But if you only integrate to a half, what is the area under the curve that you're computing? Well, it is this part of a circle, which you can break into a 30 degree sector of the circle, which has an area of pi on 12, plus a right triangle with a base of a half and a height of root three on two. So that integral should come out to this expression and rearranging for pi, you get the following. Now, if you evaluate only the first five terms, you get pi equals 3.14161. That's off by just two parts in a hundred thousand. And to match the computational power of Van Koehlen's four quintillion sided polygon, you would only need to compute 50 terms in Newton's series. What before took years now would take only days. So no one was bisecting polygons to find pi ever again. Why would you? Yeah, do you do all that work and somebody comes along and beats you in a second? It's sort of like, you know, once someone builds a crane and then somebody else is still climbing up on a ladder to put a brick on a house. Like, that's just not how you build houses anymore. We have new technology. Are you out of your mind? You're going to, you know, we're going to build a hundred story house. You're going to build a five story thing that's going to fall over. You see it in New York City. You see literally where technology came along. There's like rows and rows of five story buildings. And all of a sudden, here's a 20 story and here's a 30 story and here's a 90 story. So it's all about who has the technology. For me, this is a story about how the obvious way of doing things is not always the best way. And that it's often a good idea to play around with patterns and push them beyond the bounds where you expect them to work. Because a little bit of insight and mathematics can go a very long way.

Then came a problem considered impossible. The secret to solving it was to separate math from the real world, to split algebra from geometry, and to invent new numbers so fanciful they are called imaginary. Ironically, 400 years later, these very numbers turn up in the heart of our best physical theory of the universe. Only by abandoning math's connection to reality could we discover reality's true nature. In 1494, Luca Pacioli, who is Leonardo da Vinci's math teacher, publishes Summa de Arithmetica, a comprehensive summary of all mathematics known in Renaissance Italy at the time. In it, there is a section on the cubic, any equation which today we would write as ax cubed plus bx squared plus cx plus d equals zero. People have been trying to find a general solution to the cubic for at least 4,000 years, but each ancient civilization that encountered it, the Babylonians, Greeks, Chinese, Indians, Egyptians, and Persians, they all came up empty-handed. Pacioli's conclusion is that a solution to the cubic equation is impossible. Now this should be at least a little surprising, since without the x cubed term, the equation is simply a quadratic. And many ancient civilizations had solved quadratics thousands of years earlier. Today, anyone who's passed eighth grade knows the general solution. It's minus b plus minus root b squared minus 4ac all over 2a. But most people just plug and chug into this formula completely oblivious to the geometry that ancient mathematicians used to derive it. You know, back in those days, mathematics wasn't written down in equations. It was written with words and pictures. Take, for example, the equation x squared plus 26x equals 27. Ancient mathematicians would think of the x squared term like a literal square with sides of length x. And then 26x, well, that would be a rectangle with one side of length 26 and the other side of length x. And these two areas together add to 27. So how do we figure out what x is? Well, we can take this 26x rectangle and cut it in half. So now I have two 13x rectangles and I can position them so the new shape I create is almost a square. It's just missing this section down here. But I know the dimensions of this section. It's just 13 by 13. So I can complete the square by adding in a 13 by 13 square. Now, since I've added 13 squared or 169 to the left-hand side of the equation, I also have to add 169 to the right-hand side of the equation to maintain the equality. So now I have this larger square with sides of length x plus 13 and it is equal to 196. Now, the square root of 196 is 14. So I know that the sides of this square have length 14, which means x is equal to 1. Now, this is a great visual way to solve a quadratic equation, but it isn't complete. I mean, if you look at our original equation, x equals 1 is a solution, but so is negative 27. For thousands of years, mathematicians were oblivious to the negative solutions to their equations because they were dealing with things in the real world, lengths and areas and volumes. I mean, what would it mean to have a square with sides of length negative 27? That just doesn't make any sense. So for those mathematicians, negative numbers didn't exist. You could subtract, that is, find the difference between two positive quantities, but you couldn't have a negative answer or negative coefficients. Mathematicians were so averse to negative numbers that there was no single quadratic equation. Instead, there were six different versions arranged so that the coefficients were always positive. The same approach was taken with the cubic. In the 11th century, Persian mathematician Omar Khayyam identified 19 different cubic equations, again keeping all coefficients positive. He found numerical solutions to some of them by considering the intersections of shapes like hyperbolas and circles. But he fell short of his ultimate goal, a general solution to the cubic. He wrote, maybe one of those who will come after us will succeed in finding it. 400 years later and 4,000 kilometers away, the solution begins to take shape. Scipione del Faro is a mathematics professor at the University of Bologna. Sometime around 1510, he finds a method to reliably solve depressed cubics. These are a subset of cubic equations with no x squared term. So what does he do after solving a problem that has stumped mathematicians for millennia? When considered impossible by Leonardo da Vinci's math teacher, he tells no one. See, being a mathematician in the 1500s is hard. Your job is constantly under threat from other mathematicians who can show up at any time and challenge you for your position. You can think of it like a math duel. Each participant submits a set of questions to the other and the person who solves the most questions correctly gets the job. While the loser suffers public humiliation. As far as del Faro knows, no one else in the world can solve the depressed cubic. So by keeping his solution secret, he guarantees his own job security. For nearly two decades, del Faro keeps his secret. Only on his deathbed in 1526 does he let it slip to his student, Antonio Fior. Fior is not as talented a mathematician as his mentor, but he is young and ambitious. And after del Faro's death, he boasts about his own mathematical prowess and specifically his ability to solve the depressed cubic. On February 12, 1535, Fior challenges mathematician Niccolo Fontana Tartaglia, who has recently moved to Fior's hometown of Venice. Niccolo Fontana is no stranger to adversity. As a kid, his face was cut open by a French soldier, leaving him with a stutter. That's why he's known as Tartaglia, which means stutterer in Italian. Growing up in poverty, Tartaglia is largely self-taught. He claws his way up through Italian society to become a respected mathematician. Now, all of that is at stake. As is the custom in the challenge, Tartaglia gives a varied assortment of 30 problems to Fior. Fior gives 30 problems to Tartaglia, all of which are depressed cubics. Each mathematician has 40 days to solve the 30 problems they've been given. Fior can't solve a single problem. Tartaglia solves all 30 of Fior's depressed cubics in just two hours. It seems Fior's boastfulness was his undoing. Before the challenge came, Tartaglia learns of Fior's claim to have solved the depressed cubic, but he's skeptical. I did not deem him capable of finding such a rule on his own, Tartaglia writes. But word was that a great mathematician had revealed the secret to Fior, which seems more plausible. So with the knowledge that a solution to the cubic is possible, and with his livelihood on the line, Tartaglia sets about solving the depressed cubic himself. To do it, he extends the idea of completing the square into three dimensions. Take the equation x cubed plus 9x equals 26. You can think of x cubed as the volume of a cube with sides of length x. And if you add a volume of 9x, you get 26. So just like with completing the square, we need to add onto the cube to increase its volume by 9x. Imagine extending three sides of this cube out a distance y, creating a new larger cube with sides of length, call it z. z is just x plus y. The original cube has been padded out, and we can break up the additional volume into seven shapes. There are three rectangular prisms with dimensions of x by x by y, and another three narrower prisms with dimensions of x by y by y. Plus there's a cube with a volume y cubed. Tartaglia rearranges the six rectangular prisms into one block. One side has length 3y, the other has a length x plus y, which is z, and the height is x. So the volume of this shape is its base, 3yz, times its height, x. And Tartaglia realizes this volume can perfectly represent the 9x term in the equation if its base is equal to 9. So he sets 3yz equals 9. Putting the cube back together, you find we're missing the one small y cubed block. So we can complete the cube by adding y cubed to both sides of the equation. Now we have z cubed, the complete larger cube, equals 26 plus y cubed. We have two equations and two unknowns. Solving the first equation for z and substituting into the second, we get y to the 6 plus 26y cubed equals 27. At first glance, it seems like we're now worse off than when we started. The variable is now raised to the power of 6 instead of just 3. However, if you think of y cubed as a new variable, the equation is actually a quadratic. The same quadratic that we solved by completing the square. So we know y cubed equals 1, which means y equals 1. And z equals 3 over y, so z is 3. And since x plus y equals z, x must be equal to 2. Which is indeed a solution to the original equation. And with that, Tartaglia becomes the second human on the planet to solve the depressed cubic. To save himself the work of going through the geometry for each new cubic he encounters, Tartaglia summarizes his method in an algorithm, a set of instructions. He writes this down not as a set of equations like we would today. Modern algebraic notation wouldn't exist for another hundred years, but instead as a poem. Tartaglia's victory makes him something of a celebrity. Mathematicians are desperate to learn how he solved the cubic, especially Gerolamo Cardano, a polymath based in Milan. As you can guess, Tartaglia will have none of it. He refuses to reveal even a single question from the competition. But Cardano is persistent. He writes a series of letters that alternate between flattery and aggressive attacks. Eventually, with the promise of an introduction to his wealthy benefactor, Cardano manages to lure Tartaglia to Milan. And there, on March 25th, 1539, Tartaglia reveals his method. But only after forcing Cardano to swear a solemn oath, not to tell anyone the method, not to publish it, and to write it only in cipher, quote, so that after my death, no one shall be able to understand it. Cardano is delighted and immediately starts playing around with Tartaglia's algorithm. But he has a loftier goal in mind, a solution to the full cubic equation including the x squared term. And amazingly, he discovers it. If you substitute for x, x minus b over 3a, then all the x squared terms cancel out. This is the way to turn any general cubic equation into a depressed cubic, which can then be solved by Tartaglia's formula. Cardano is so excited to have solved the problem that stumped the best mathematicians for thousands of years, he wants to publish it. Unlike his peers, Cardano has no need to keep the solution a secret. He makes his living not as a mathematician, but as a physician and famous intellectual. For him, the credit is more valuable than the secret. The only problem is the oath he swore to Tartaglia, who won't let him break it. And you might think this would be the end of it. But in 1542, Cardano travels to Bologna and there he visits a mathematician who just happens to be the son-in-law of one Scipione del Faro, the man who, on his deathbed, gave the solution to the depressed cubic to Antonio Fior. Cardano finds this solution in del Faro's old notebook, which is shared with him during the visit. This solution predates Tartaglia's by decades. So now, as Cardano sees it, he can publish the full solution to the cubic without violating his oath to Tartaglia. Three years later, Cardano publishes Ars Magna, the great art, an updated compendium of mathematics, written in five years, may it last for 500. Cardano writes a chapter with a unique geometric proof for each of the 13 arrangements of the cubic equation. Although he acknowledges the contributions of Tartaglia, del Faro, and Fior, Tartaglia is displeased, to say the least. He writes insulting letters to Cardano and CCs a good fraction of the mathematics community. And he has a point. To this day, the general solution to the cubic is often called Cardano's method. But Ars Magna is a phenomenal achievement. It pushes geometrical reasoning to its very breaking point, literally. While Cardano is writing Ars Magna, he comes across some cubic equations that can't easily be solved in the usual way, like X cubed equals 15X plus four. Plugging this into the algorithm yields a solution that contains the square roots of negative numbers. Cardano asks Tartaglia about the case, but he evades and implies Cardano is just not clever enough to use his formula properly. The reality is, Tartaglia has no idea what to do either. Cardano walks back through the geometric derivation of a similar problem to see exactly what goes wrong. While the 3D cube slicing and rearrangement works just fine, the final quadratic completing the square step leads to a geometric paradox. Cardano finds part of a square that must have an area of 30, but also sides of length five. Since the full square has an area of 25, to complete the square, Cardano has to somehow add negative area. That is where the square roots of negatives come from, the idea of negative area. Now, this isn't the first time square roots of negatives show up in mathematics. In fact, earlier in Ars Magna is this problem. Find two numbers that add to 10 and multiply to 40. You can combine these equations into the quadratic x squared plus 40 equals 10x. But if you plug this into the quadratic formula, the solutions contain the square roots of negatives. The obvious conclusion is that a solution doesn't exist, which you can verify by looking at the original problem. There are no two real numbers which add to 10 and multiply to 40. So mathematicians understood square roots of negative numbers were math's way of telling you there is no solution. But this cubic equation is different. With a little guessing and checking, you can find that x equals four is a solution. So why doesn't the approach that works for all other cubics find the perfectly reasonable solution to this one? Unable to see a way forward, Cardano avoids this case in Ars Magna, saying the idea of the square root of negatives is as subtle as it is useless. But around 10 years later, the Italian engineer, Rafael Bombelli, picks up where Cardano left off. Undeterred by the square roots of negatives and the impossible geometry they imply, he wants to find a way through the mess to the solution. Observing that the square root of a negative cannot be called either positive or negative, he lets it be its own new type of number. Bombelli assumes the two terms in Cardano's solution can be represented as some combination of an ordinary number and this new type of number, which involves the square root of negative one. And this way, Bombelli figures out that the two cube roots in Cardano's equation are equivalent to two plus or minus the square root of negative one. So when he takes the final step and adds them together, the square roots cancel out, leaving the correct answer four. This feels nothing short of miraculous. Cardano's method does work, but you have to abandon the geometric proof that generated it in the first place. Negative areas, which make no sense in reality, must exist as an intermediate step on the way to the solution. Over the next hundred years, modern mathematics takes shape. In the 1600s, Francois Viette introduces the modern symbolic notation for algebra, ending the millennia-long tradition of math problems as drawings and wordy descriptions. Geometry is no longer the source of truth. René Descartes makes heavy use of the square roots of negatives, popularizing them as a result. And while he recognizes their utility, he calls them imaginary numbers, a name that sticks, which is why Euler later introduces the letter I to represent the square root of negative one. When combined with regular numbers, they form complex numbers. The cubic led to the invention of these new numbers and liberated algebra from geometry. By letting go of what seems like the best description of reality, the geometry you can see and touch, you get a much more powerful and complete mathematics that can solve real problems. And it turns out the cubic is just the beginning. In 1925, Erwin Schrödinger is searching for a wave equation that governs the behavior of quantum particles, building on de Broglie's insight that matter consists of waves. He comes up with one of the most important and famous equations in all of physics, the Schrödinger equation. And featured prominently within it is I, the square root of negative one. While mathematicians have grown accustomed to imaginary numbers, physicists have not and are uncomfortable seeing it show up in such a fundamental theory. Schrödinger himself writes, what is unpleasant here and indeed directly to be objected to is the use of complex numbers. The wave function psi is surely fundamentally a real function. This seems like a fair objection. So why does an imaginary number that first appeared in the solution to the cubic turn up in fundamental physics? Well, it's because of some unique properties of imaginary numbers. Imaginary numbers exist on a dimension perpendicular to the real number line. Together, they form the complex plane. Watch what happens when we repeatedly multiply by I. Starting with one, one times I is I. I times I is negative one by definition. Negative one times I is negative I and negative I times I is one. We've come back to where we started and if we keep multiplying by I, the point will keep rotating around. So when you're multiplying by I, what you're really doing is rotating by 90 degrees in a complex plane. Now there is a function that repeatedly multiplies by I as you go down the x-axis and that is e to the ix. It creates a spiral by essentially spreading out these rotations all along the x-axis. If you look at the real part of the spiral, it's a cosine wave. And if you look at the imaginary part, it's a sine wave. The two quintessential functions that describe waves are both contained in e to the ix. So when Schrödinger goes to write down a wave equation, he naturally assumes that the solutions to his equation will look something like e to the ix, specifically e to the ikx minus omega t. You might wonder why he would use that formulation and not just a simple sine wave, but the exponential has some useful properties. If you take the derivative with respect to position or time, that derivative is proportional to the original function itself. And that's not true if you use the sine function whose derivative is cosine. Plus, since the Schrödinger equation is linear, you can add together an arbitrary number of solutions of this form, creating any sort of wave shape you like, and it too will be a solution to Schrödinger's equation. The physicist Freeman Dyson later writes, Schrödinger put the square root of minus one into the equation, and suddenly it made sense. Suddenly, it became a wave equation instead of a heat conduction equation. And Schrödinger found to his delight that the equation has solutions corresponding to the quantized orbits in the Bohr model of the atom. It turns out that the Schrödinger equation describes correctly everything we know about the behavior of atoms. It is the basis of all of chemistry and most of physics. And that square root of minus one means that nature works with complex numbers and not with real numbers. This discovery came as a complete surprise to Schrödinger as well as to everybody else. So imaginary numbers discovered as a quirky intermediate step on the way to solving the cubic turn out to be fundamental to our description of reality. Only by giving up maths connection to reality could it guide us to a deeper truth about the way the universe works.

Simply touching it may cause you to overdose, so what exactly does it do to your brain and body? Fentanyl is an opioid that can inhibit pain signals in multiple pathways along the brain and spinal cord. This is why it was initially prescribed for pain relief. It also causes your brain to make extra dopamine, creating sensations of intense euphoria and relaxation. Essentially, fentanyl hijacks your body's built-in system of endorphins by binding to your opioid receptors much in the same way your endorphins do, but at a significantly stronger level. This might sound fun, but activating these receptors can also suppress your brain's ability to detect CO2 levels in the body, potentially causing a person to stop breathing. On top of this, side effects include dizziness, chills, vomiting, fainting, difficulty urinating, and extreme constipation. In addition, fentanyl is much stronger than other opioids, 100 times stronger than morphine and 50 times stronger than heroin. For many drugs to work, they need to pass the blood-brain barrier. This barrier allows small fat-soluble substances to pass and water-loving molecules to be inhibited. Both morphine and heroin are lipid-soluble, but they have polar, water-loving groups that make them pass the barrier much more slowly, whereas fentanyl is extremely non-polar and fat-soluble, entering the brain within seconds. This means you only need tiny amounts to get high. And that's where, in part, the danger lies. A lethal dose of fentanyl can be around 2 milligrams, in a test tube that looks like two grains of salt. And since a high level of precision is needed to dose it effectively, it's very easy to overdose. In fact, there are some reported incidents of first responders OD-ing from simply touching fentanyl powder or inhaling its dust. Though some toxicologists doubt the accuracy of these cases. If it can be administered in time, an injection of naloxone can be given to a person which works to stop an overdose by blocking opioid receptors. But the science cannot keep up with the rate of new fentanyl analogs being produced, like carfentanil, which is 10,000 times more powerful than morphine and has been cited for its possible use in chemical warfare. Today, drug overdose deaths in America are rising faster than ever, with 65,000 deaths in 2016 compared to 59,000 in 2015, and opioid use is the crux of the problem. For context, this is higher than the peak gun deaths, peak HIV deaths, and peak car crash deaths. All evidence points towards the problem worsening by the end of 2017. The reason? Research points to widespread prescription of opioids for pain, which leads to addiction. There's also an ease of access for non-prescribers causing millions of tablets to fall into the wrong hands. As the danger became more clear, doctors decreased prescriptions of opioids, but this didn't change the fact that thousands of people were addicted, causing them to seek out illegal markets. With an increase in demand, illicit drug markets turned to cheaper production solutions. Unlike heroin, which is synthesized from poppies, fentanyl is entirely synthetic and can be made anywhere for cheap. China has become a heavyweight in manufacturing fentanyl, and North American law is working to seize supply. However, the UN urges that solutions to the crisis will lie in persuading people not to use opioids, as blocking China's market may simply cause production to move to another nation. Several experts are calling for government support for safe consumption sites where people suffering addiction can be supervised, minimizing risk of overdose, and be supported with counselling and anti-withdrawal drugs that can help people stop using.

You may have heard people arguing over electric vehicles versus gas vehicles, but now the debate has come into the kitchen with gas stoves versus electric stoves. Some recent research has called into question the safety of gas stoves and their detrimental impact on human health, as well as the environment. And as a result, it has led to a lot of headlines and political battles. But considering I have one in my very own home, I just wanted to know how bad is it actually for my health and the environment and what can I or you do about it? For the sake of clarity, I'm not going to be comparing which version of a stove heats or cooks your food the best or most efficient or is the cheapest. Number one, because I'm a terrible cook and none of those things are going to save me. And number two, while those things are interesting and can be scientific, I'm mostly concerned with the health and environmental impacts and don't want to get lost in too many different variables here. So around 35 to 40 percent of US households actually use gas stoves. And there are basically two ways that they can pollute your home. The first is obvious. When your gas stove is on, it's literally burning gas. And there's no smoke-free combustion. The heat that is created can cause nitrogen and oxygen to bond, creating nitric oxide and nitrogen dioxide, both of which are considered toxic gases and lung irritants and can aggravate existing conditions, particularly in children. But it can also emit carbon monoxide, methane, formaldehyde and particulate matter, which decades of research have shown negatively affect our respiratory and cardiovascular systems. The level of these toxic compounds is so bad, in fact, that the EPA or Environmental Protection Agency would consider it illegal if it was outside. Let me restate that clearly. The emissions that can be produced in your home from your gas stove are so high that if those levels were recorded outside, the EPA would consider it illegal. The outdoor safety standards are exceeded within minutes of your gas stove being on. And while there are regulations in place to lower nitrogen dioxide levels outside, there are no such regulations or any oversight on indoor appliances. Meaning the pollution in your home can be several times worse than if you were standing right beside a highway with tons of car traffic or near heavy industry. And outdoors, at least, the fumes disperse and are not so concentrated or confined in your home. And these fumes and their impact can linger well after your stove is turned off. But the second way that gas stoves impact our health is actually a little scarier. Because even when your gas stove isn't running, research has shown that they can still emit toxic compounds like benzene, which is a carcinogen, and trace quantities of 21 other chemicals considered hazardous. And we're not talking about insignificant amounts. So the latest research has found that simply having a gas stove in your home that's off can leave levels of benzene as high as if you had a smoker in your home. In other words, your gas stove is potentially releasing just as much benzene as a cigarette, making them akin to secondhand smoke. And that's when the stove is off. In fact, the newest research shows that nearly 13% of all current cases of childhood asthma in the US are due to the use of gas stoves, which is comparable to secondhand smoke. If America didn't have gas stoves, 13% of childhood asthma cases would be prevented. Now, some people might be saying, what about electric stoves? Don't they also release pollutants? And the truth is, yes, some particulate matter does come from electric stoves, but they're not combusting methane, which means you're not getting products like nitrogen dioxide. And what about your gas-powered furnaces or water heaters? Well, they typically vent pollution directly outside. But the stove being right in the middle of your kitchen often isn't even properly vented, which we'll get to in a minute, along with what you can actually do to minimize these impacts. Before that, I just want to talk about the environmental impact of gas stoves. After all, you are using a fossil fuel to heat or cook your food. Researchers found that the methane emissions from gas stoves in the US alone are equal to adding 500,000 cars to the road each year. Gas combustion in buildings added up is about 12% of total greenhouse gas emissions for the US. But it's important to remember that this number includes things like gas furnaces and boilers, basically all gas usage in buildings. Ultimately, cooking is a fraction of these methane emissions. But many municipalities are working towards banning or preventing gas lines being created into new buildings and helping to subsidize the change from gas appliances and utilities to electric. Because it's not just your stove that can leak gas. The gas supply chain leaks methane from start to finish. Piping in the walls can have leaks, and even on its way to your house, it can leak into the atmosphere, contributing to methane emissions which are rising globally. Of course, methane is a way more potent greenhouse gas than carbon dioxide, even though it doesn't stay in the atmosphere as long. And if we want to minimize the impacts of climate change, scientists say we need to leave the majority of fossil fuels, including gas reserves, in the ground. Now, depending where you live, if you have an electric stove, the energy for cooking may still come from fossil fuels either way. But the combustion at least happens at a power plant far away from your lungs. And the hope is, over the coming years, more and more power grids will be supported and powered by renewable and emissions-free energy. So now we come back here and to you wondering, what the f*** do I do? Trust me, I feel you, as this news and research was being released, I started feeling freaked out to just be in my own home. So what can you actually do if you have a gas stove? First, you should definitely be using a ventilation system while the gas is going, and a little while after, which a lot of people, including myself, don't do. The vent will help usher the air pollution outside, which doesn't do much for the environmental problem, but at least protects your lungs. But one major problem is that not all vent hoods are created equal. In fact, some are actually not connected to the outside, and instead the fan's just recirculating the air indoors, which isn't doing much good. And some of you may not even have a vent or a range hood, in which case, your best option is to open a window or a door to get the air circulating. Even better, get a fan pushing the indoor air out. Ultimately, the best solution to this problem is not having a gas stove to begin with, which sucks to say because most people are not in the position to get a new appliance. But it is something that I am seriously considering right now. When it comes to electric, you have a choice between standard and induction, both of which will create a safer environment indoors and have a lower impact on the environment. At the end of the day, it's a bit of a risk calculation. If you're healthy and have a quality ventilation system or a big kitchen, it may not be your biggest concern, though it will still impact the environment. But if you have kids in the home or somebody with a compromised respiratory or cardiovascular system, it may not be worth having a direct source of pollution in the middle of your home, especially if you can afford the change or are in the market for a new stove. I hope this video was helpful and not too scary. At the end of the day, I think it's important we know the reality of the up-to-date research in science and from there we can start to make educated decisions about our own personal health and the collective health of those around us, including the environment.

Do you feel tired all the time? If you're anything like me, you've spent years of your life either waking up tired every single day or just generally feeling drained all the time. It sucks. Except I honestly don't feel that way anymore. I spent the past few years obsessing over sleep research and my own habits to figure out how to feel less tired and be more energized, and that's what I'm going to share today. The top research and expert back tips that I followed to not only feel more alert and alive, but it'll also help you fall asleep way faster for those who struggle with that too. Consider this the ultimate guide to feeling less tired that you and I can reference back to whenever we're hitting those slumps in life. First up, we have to get two obvious things out of the way. Number one, are you getting enough sleep? I know this hardly feels like a tip worth sharing. Hmm, maybe you should sleep more if you're tired. But a lot of people don't know how much sleep their brain and body actually needs. Like how many hours should you be asleep for? The answer is seven to eight hours consistently is the most optimal, but over 50% of people are getting less than six hours a night. And countless studies have shown that getting less than six hours on a regular basis is equivalent to being cognitively drunk and under four hours a night is obviously even worse. There's a very small genetic minority that can handle really low hours, but chances are you and I are not it, especially if you clicked on this video. So if you're struggling with energy and being tired, the first place to look is the sheer number of hours you're getting. Do whatever you can to regularly get as close to eight hours as possible. And if you aren't already, you'll likely feel a huge difference. And number two, just before we jump into the changes you can actually make today, an important question to ask yourself is what is your chronotype? Are you an early bird or a night owl? These might just seem like cute terms, but we can actually see genetic differences that make some people more prone to get up early and others to stay up late. And it's not simply a matter of making yourself go to bed at a different time. If you're naturally a night owl, but you're trying to make yourself fall asleep early, you won't be getting good quality sleep because it doesn't match your innate circadian rhythm. It's part of the reason teenagers are so desperately exhausted in school because their chronotype naturally shifts to later at night as they go through puberty, meaning early mornings are exceptionally hard. Your start times at school increased class attendance, decreased behavioral and psychological problems and decreased substance and alcohol abuse in teens. I know your schedule isn't always your choice, but if you have the flexibility to match your chronotype, you'll be going a long way to feeling less tired. Also know that your chronotype can change throughout your life. All right. So I thought the easiest way to break down these science back tips would be chronologically, starting from the moment you wake up and going through your day all the way to your bedtime and sleeping habits. But before we do that, I want to take a quick moment to thank today's sponsor, Google career certificates for sponsoring this portion of the video.

Head to grow.google slash certificates to start learning job ready skills that will help you in job applications and interviews. Thanks again to Google career certificates for sponsoring this portion of the video. And now back to more tiredness tips. All right. What are the first moments of your day likely include an alarm? It's maybe time to change your alarm sound. Studies have shown that melodic alarms like those that play music, not only reduce perceived sleep inertia and tiredness in the morning, but actually improve psycho motor abilities and reduce attention issues compared to neutral alarms. Personally, I love an alarm that starts quiet and slowly builds over time so that I'm not jarred out of sleep, but ultimately you just want to choose something that's melodic like music. Don't hit snooze. Your body goes through multiple sleep cycles every night from light sleep to deep sleep to REM sleep and then back to light sleep. And this repeats over and over. And if your alarm goes off in the middle of deep sleep, you're way more likely to feel sleep inertia and groggy when woken up. Now the problem with the snooze button is when you're getting close to your natural waking time, the body starts preparing itself by releasing hormones and increasing body temperature, but alarms often cut this process short, which is why you feel tired, especially when sleep deprived. But by hitting the snooze button, you're basically telling your body to restart another sleep cycle and head back towards deep sleep. This means you'll have the same problem when the alarm goes off again and may feel even more tired. Obviously you're much better off getting that extra 10 or 20 minutes of sleep time than setting your alarm early and just snoozing it a bunch. Move around when you wake up. Recent evidence has shown that as little as 30 seconds of physical activity can improve perceived alertness in the morning. This may be because of an increased cortisol awakening response. Important to note that while participants felt more alert, they actually didn't perform any better on tests with morning exercise. But hey, sometimes you just want to feel better. Expose yourself to bright light in the morning. Bright exposure is key to regulating your sleep patterns. Of course, sunlight is the best way to trigger this, but studies have even found that bright artificial light in the morning can help stimulate wakefulness. Even beyond just the morning, make sure you're being exposed to daylight. Try to get outside in natural sunlight for at least 30 minutes a day. And if you have problems falling asleep, experts recommend one hour of morning daylight exposure and to turn down the lights before bedtime. Hydration. First thing in the morning when your body hasn't taken in any fluids for a while can be super helpful. Studies have shown that not only are alertness and concentration improved with hydration, but so are cognitive abilities and your mood. Caffeine. We all know her, we all love her. I mean, obviously caffeine is like a secret cheat code for feeling less tired. Your brain naturally accumulates adenosine through the day, making you feel tired, but caffeine binds to these same receptors, blocking them from making you feel tired. And that's a great temporary solution. Except with chronic caffeine use, your brain actually creates more receptors, meaning you need more caffeine to block that adenosine accumulation. For the most part, people can have a perfectly healthy relationship with caffeine. The bigger problem seems to be how close to bedtime you're drinking it. Since the half life of coffee is around six hours, that means if you have a coffee at six PM, by midnight there would still be 50% of it in your body. And this caffeine has a direct impact on sleep quality. Ultimately, trying to contain your caffeine intake to the morning or midday will not only make it easier to fall asleep, but it will actually improve your sleep quality through the night. Now, if you're consuming, let's talk about diet. Now, anecdotally, I personally feel a huge difference when I'm eating healthy consistently. And so this has become a major focus area for me. I can immediately feel energy changes when I'm not eating well, but the science behind this area is tricky because there's so many different diets and everybody's body reacts differently to food. There are some studies that show correlations between whole food diets and higher energy levels or that higher levels of processed foods make people feel more tired. Further research has found that high sugar and low fiber diets also impact non-REM sleep quality and result in more awakenings at night. Without trying to give you diet advice, I'll just say that for me, my food intake has personally played a huge role in my energy levels. But the hardest part was that it wasn't an immediate thing. It's been sort of over a long term habit change that I could really see those differences. I still obviously let myself indulge, but now I can immediately feel the difference when I've eaten really unwell. We all have a general idea of what healthy eating is, so do what feels right for you within those guidelines. Similar to coffee though, you don't want to be eating too close to bed because that can cause indigestion, which impacts your sleep. Exercise. This one has been the other game changer for me, which I know is so annoying to hear. I used to hate exercising, but I started by just adding more walks in my day and have slowly worked my way up to proper resistance training and cardio. I'm actually really proud of how far I've come. Like, look at me lifting those weights. Sleep studies show that exercise increases total sleep time, especially non-REM and increases the overall quality of sleep. On average, subjective alertness improves, and the time it takes participants to fall asleep decreases with fewer waking times across the night. But an interesting takeaway from these studies is that the relationship between exercise and sleep isn't always consistent on a day to day basis. So just because you worked out hard today doesn't mean you'll see or feel those benefits tonight. Much like diet, it's the long term changes that seem to make a bigger difference. Ironically, studies also find that while exercise improves sleep, sleep can improve your exercise capacity, so it's a nice little positive reinforcement circle going on there. I know it's impossible to untangle the tips I've already shared and the ones I've still yet to share, but I feel like exercise has had one of the biggest impacts on my life. I spend a lot of the day sitting on a chair looking at a computer, and the days where I go without moving, I can physically feel my energy levels lower. It's the weirdest phenomenon that moving and using energy gives you more energy, but personally that is what I have found. Ultimately, it's pretty clear from the research that a sedentary lifestyle not only impacts sleep quality, but life quality. The only time to avoid exercise is, you guessed it, right before bed. Body temperature can remain high for an hour or two, so too close to bed makes it harder for your body to drop its temperature in preparation for sleep. Napping. My favorite thing. 20 to 30 minute naps have been shown to increase productivity, cognitive function, memory, creativity, and make people feel less tired. Just remember though, under 30 minutes and you're not likely to go into deep sleep. If you want to go longer, I suggest sleeping a full sleep cycle, which is around 1.5 hours for most people. To me, this is a sleep and not a nap, but you're way more likely to wake up out of light sleep and experience less sleep inertia. Finally, try not to nap after 3pm, because that can affect your ability to fall asleep later. Alcohol. It's ironic that we tend to drink in the evenings, because alcohol is sleep's worst enemy. You might think a nightcap relaxes you or helps you fall asleep better, but the truth is it robs you of REM sleep and keeps you in the lighter stages of sleep. It can contribute to impaired breathing through the night, and you're more likely to wake up in the middle of the night when the effects have worn off. And of course, being hungover won't make you feel any more energetic tomorrow, or look any better for that matter. Now, when it comes to bedtime, have a warm shower or bath before bed. Once you get out of the warmth, your body will radiate the heat and start working to cool down. And this is actually one of the natural processes that happens as you fall asleep. Your body temperature drops. So by creating an environment where that can happen naturally, your body and brain will begin to feel sleepy. Not to mention the natural relaxation that a calming bath can provide. Sleep in a dark, cool environment. For a similar reason, having a cool environment helps promote sleep. And darkness plays a major role in not stimulating your brain, so remove any gadgets or bright clocks that might be super visible. In fact, if you have a clock, it's better to turn it away from you so you won't worry about the time while you're trying to fall asleep. Put away your gadgets. I know it's tempting, if not literally impossible, not to sit in bed and use your phone, and I even used to use mine as my alarm. But not only does pre-bedtime phone use stimulate your brain with activity and shine light directly into your eyes, tricking your brain into thinking the time might be different, but simply having the phone in your room and being able to see it can occupy your mind. So if you can bear it, put the phone and any other gadgets outside your bedroom. Don't lie awake in bed. If you can't fall asleep for over 30 minutes, it's often better to get up and try and do a relaxing activity until you feel sleepy. It's so easy to feel anxious when your eyes are closed and nothing's happening and you know you have to be up early in the morning. That only makes things worse. So get up for a bit and do what you can to just chill and relax. If you wake up in the middle of the night, don't check the clock. Checking the time in the middle of the night can cause anxiety and a cortisol spike, which will only make it harder to go back to sleep. Individuals who have insomnia often watch the clock, causing a similar effect. And while you're up, try and avoid any bright lights like a bathroom light. Again, your body's circadian rhythm responds to light, so the darker you can keep it, the better. Night lights aren't just for kids. Now, before I go over the final and most important tip, it's worth mentioning that there are obviously health issues and medical conditions that can affect not only your sleep, but your energy levels. So if you seem to be trying everything and nothing's working, it's definitely worth talking to your healthcare professional. And perhaps the most important tip of all, develop a sleep schedule. This along with exercise and sleep has easily had the biggest impact on my energy levels. You want to try and go to bed and wake up at the same time every day. If you can't follow any other tips, I suggest this one in conjunction with getting enough sleep. This routine will set up your body to work like literal clockwork. Anytime my sleep schedule gets moved around, whether we're traveling or it was the weekend and I was out, I can always tell how badly it impacts my life over the next few days. So the more you can keep a consistent schedule, the more your body knows the game, when to fall asleep immediately, when it should start its morning routine, and when you need your most energy. I'm telling you, commit to a schedule and even when you get bumped off of it, which is inevitable, just take your time and get back on track. For me, that's going to bed at midnight and waking up at 8 a.m. every day that I possibly can. For you, that might be shifted to a different time. And when I'm in a good swing of it, I rarely need my alarm because my body just naturally wakes up. At the end of the day, I'll say it again, for me, I think sleep schedule, exercise and diet have had the biggest role in my energy levels. Yes, I fall off course and sometimes have bad days or weeks in a row where I'm exhausted. But thinking back on who I used to be before I implemented all these practices, I was literally tired every day. I would say to myself, I'm always exhausted and I actually don't feel that way anymore. Yes, I still have tired days, but me as a whole, I'm a person with way more energy. So my fingers are crossed that this list is useful to you and helps you become a more well rested, energized person. If you have your own personal anecdotes or other studies you know of, feel free to comment. Many people will be looking for any little extra tip they can do to optimize their sleep and energy.

First we're going to look at your emotional intelligence. One of the most common tests involves identifying emotions in people's faces. For example, what is this expression? Do you think it's embarrassment, sadness, amusement or shame? If you guessed embarrassment, you're correct. This test is used to help measure your ability to empathize and communicate effectively with others. So let's look at a more ubiquitous test for intelligence. The IQ test, also known as the intelligence quotient. It's a standardized test that assesses both verbal and nonverbal abilities. Study this geometrical pattern sequence right now. Now of the six tiles below, which tile would you choose to complete the pattern? I'll give you a couple seconds, but pause the video if you need more time. If you picked number five, you're correct. Basically, each row has a diamond, a square and a triangle, as well as a solid bar, a lined bar and an empty bar. Since this bottom row has a triangle and a diamond, we know the next one's a square. And it also has a lined and an empty bar, so we know we need a solid bar. The direction of the bar is also the same in each line. Though IQ tests are common, other ways to test if you're smart do exist. There's now a prominent theory of multiple intelligences, such as musical rhythmic intelligence. Let's test your pitch. Which of these songs sounds off to you? Song one? Song two? Or song three? If you guessed clip three, you have a good sense of pitch. Though not fully understood, you could be tone deaf and still have perfect hearing, but how your brain interprets the sound may make it difficult to interpret pitch. Now, what about your visual intelligence? I'm going to show you a picture of these six shapes for ten seconds. Try to remember them as best as you can. Okay, now which of these three did you already see? If you guessed C, you're correct. This task needed to use ziggurans, novel objects that don't exist in real life, in order to accurately test you. If you're good at the zigguran task, you may have higher visual intelligence, which is not the same as IQ. But it could mean that you'll excel at tasks like matching fingerprints, interpreting medical x-rays, or keeping track of aircraft on radar displays. Now, not all intelligences can be measured. For example, bodily kinesthetic intelligence, the capacity to handle objects skillfully, is difficult to tease apart. A study of four-year-olds at a ballet class couldn't assess rhythm effectively, because some had already taken classes before or danced at home creating predisposed knowledge. As well, many tests require a combination of many types of intelligences, so it's hard to study just one. What all this research underscores is that there are so many ways to be smart, and it's not just about taking an IQ test.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 508\n","\n","Link  334 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/vPszR0-vTqc\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/vPszR0-vTqc\n","[youtube] vPszR0-vTqc: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] vPszR0-vTqc: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 3.50MiB in 00:42\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  We all know to stay away from poisons, like mercury, where ingesting a 200mg dose would kill you, or polonium, which only requires 1g of vaporized substance to wipe out 50 million people. But did you know that 70 cups of coffee contains enough caffeine to kill a 70kg person? This amount of caffeine can trigger heart palpitations or even cardiac arrest. Prefer alcohol as your beverage of choice? 13 consecutive shots could be lethal too. Because alcohol is a depressant, the area in the brain controlling basic life functions like breathing and heart rate begin to shut down. Too much liquid in general can be dangerous as well. Though it takes a lot, water intoxication from around 6L causes brain cells to swell, leading to headaches, seizures, comas, and even death in extreme cases. But if you stop drinking water or consume too much salt, your cells will start to shrink, leading to the condition known as hypernatremia. 48 teaspoons of your favorite seasoning at once is enough to trigger this reaction, also leading to seizures, coma, or even death. Stick your head under water or simply hold your breath and it takes around 4 minutes without oxygen to cause severe brain injury and at 6 minutes you could die. However in extreme cases, some free divers have been able to hold their breath for over 20 minutes. Cherries can also deprive you of oxygen. Say what? If you ever swallow a cherry pit, you shouldn't worry too much. Just don't bite into one. One or two ground cherry pits contains enough cyanide to take you down. And these cyanide ions inhibit the enzyme cytochrome C oxidase, causing your cells to be unable to use oxygen. Speaking of a lack of oxygen, it's at around 8000 feet above sea level that our bodies can no longer acclimatize to the limited oxygen. This is known as the death zone in mountaineering. Simply being too tall can also kill you. In the 1930s Robert Pershing Wadlow reached 8 feet 11 inches. This height put severe stress on his circulatory system and structural pressure on his bones and he died at the young age of 22. Researchers have hypothesized that every inch above 5 feet takes 1.3 years off your life. If you're worried about your pets life, you may have heard not to give them chocolate. The same chemical, theobromine, can kill us too. Our bodies metabolize theobromine more effectively though, with 1000 mg per kilogram being lethal to humans, which is the equivalent of 85 full sized chocolate bars at once. You may want that many chocolate bars after getting high, however you would need to eat 22kg of marijuana to be at risk of death. Smoke it and the amount required to overdose is comically high. Approximately 680kg of pot within 15 minutes would induce a lethal response, which may explain why there has never been a single documented death directly linked to consuming too much marijuana. Blasting some amazing music may be fun as well, just don't go above 185 decibels. The amount of air pressure from this could burst your lungs or alternatively create an embolism that travels to your heart. It may also keep your neighbours up all night, and while it's uncertain how long the body can survive without sleep, studies on rats who underwent continuous sleep deprivation lasted around 2 weeks before dying. The world record in humans is just over 11 days, but surprisingly no long term effects were documented after he caught up on his sleep. Got a burning question you want answered?

You know, the thing so many of us crave but can never seem to get enough of. The book makes it clear that a lack of sleep can affect everything from your mental health, cognitive abilities, immune system, and basically every aspect of your life. But the irony is that we don't fully understand why we or any animal for that matter sleeps. We just know that without it, most species slowly deteriorate. This is one scenario that honestly happens to me all the time, and I'm sure happens to you as well. You're getting ready for your day. You shower, you polish your pearls, you get your coffee, and you do whatever else it takes to get your brain and body moving, only to have the first person you encounter say, oh honey, you look tired. Which got us wondering about the idea of beauty sleep. Like, does sleep deprivation play an intrinsic role in the way that we look? So we are going to stay awake for the next 36 hours and document and take progress pictures of every stage. Here are the rules of our experiment. We'll take photos every six hours. We've set up a dark corner in our house so we can control the lighting as best as possible. No makeup or facial touch-ups though. No napping, which is honestly going to be really hard for us. And finally, we're allowed to have our normal morning coffee, but after that, absolutely zero caffeine. And at the end of the 36 hours awake, we are going to see just how messed up we look. We have this set up to help us measure exactly where we go. So we can have the same photo each time. No expressions so that we can match it evenly. A little fact about me. The last time I pulled an all-nighter, the second I went to bed, I pissed the bed. I was 18 years old. You were 18? I was old. Woke up, peed the bed, was so embarrassed that I took all my sheets and I threw it into a backyard somewhere I never told my parents. And they were like, did I put sheets down? I was like, no. So obviously the first 14 hours or so were pretty standard. We woke up at 8 a.m. and then just had to go on living our normal lives while taking pictures every six hours. But for whatever reason, because we knew we had to be up all night, we were feeling way more tired than normal. I'm so tired. How are you so tired? Because I nap in the afternoon. Wait, what time is it now? Six. You're so tired. I don't think I can do this. Did you know that 386 billion square feet of cardboard is made each year? Doesn't that seem absurd? To kill some time and keep busy, we took the dog for a walk and then went to the office for some science. You know, scientists actually don't really know why we look so messed up when we don't sleep, but there are two specific theories that evolutionary biologists have. And we are going to explain them today using tired 3D printed Greg. It doesn't stick. Oh no, it ran out of tape. Oh my god. Okay, wait, I can do this. So this is tired Greg. Boo, he's ugly. And this is not tired Mitch. The first theory is that since Greg is sleep deprived, he is more prone to accidents. Ow, grape lady. And tired Greg also has a weakened immune system. Cough cough. Thankfully, Greg's face is perceived as less attractive and less socially appealing. Therefore, untired, happy, happy Mitch, knows to avoid Greg at all costs. The second theory is that tired Greg is likely less optimistic and less good at showing emotions, which makes sense because his face is frozen. In this tired state, his busted face is signaling for Mitch to stay away so that he can be alone and not piss people off and get some sleep until he looks better and is finally able to talk to people again. Yay! These lights are helping. Fasting. But now I just shut my eyes and now I'm ready to go to sleep. Okay Mitch, what did you read it? Wait. We just finished recording a podcast. We decided we needed something to keep us busy. What was the podcast about? Oh, the podcast is about sleep deprivation. Oh! What do you know? It was insane. Our brains are completely shut off. We did talk about some cool other studies. So if you want to listen to the podcast, I'll put a link in the description. I feel like I'm going crazy because now that they were done the podcast, my brain's slowly melting. We're not usually up this late. Another six hours had passed so we came home to take some photos. Okay, so it is currently 4 15 a.m. I actually don't feel so, so tired, but what I am noticing is that my cognitive ability is definitely slowing down. We wanted to acknowledge the fact that my memories are not actually being formed properly. So I had this beautiful brain here. The fact is when you're sleep deprived, any time you're trying to learn or remember something, this is a lot harder to do than I thought because I had learned this, but now I am having a hard time recalling it and saying it. And there's a lot of things happening at once. I don't usually have it in a science video. So anytime you're trying to learn something, an area in your brain called the hippocampus is really active. It's basically like taking in all the information and processing it for you. But when they look at brain scans of people who are sleep deprived, the hippocampus is basically off. On top of that, the proteins that are actually required to build connections between neurons are no longer available when you're overtired. And so effectively, it's really hard to even make a memory physically. Studies have actually found that people who are sleep deprived are around 40% less efficient at remembering things. That's like the difference between literally acing an exam or failing it miserably. So if you're watching this video and perhaps you're cramming for an exam procrastinating, I'm begging you. It's really worth it for you to go to sleep because you really aren't making any solid memories right now. How do you feel? Um, I'm so tired. It's just like kind of fuzzy. Yeah. I can't stop looking the wrong way. I made this mold in an art class and I made it to make an art piece about how my obsession with celebrities is a way that I cope with my fear of death. Some things never change. Should be in the moment. Then things got a little weird. I discovered TikTok. How do you have text on top of it? I wanted to be homo sapiens, a homo neanderthalensis. Oh my God, Greg, you're insane. And then it happened. The sunlight is beaming through the room. Sunrise. I literally can't even think properly right now. I am having a second wind. Oh yeah, actually? Or third wind or fourth wind. I don't know. I'm awake. I feel good. I'm happy to see the sun. Hey there, bed. You bring all life to us on earth. The world's coming alive. Literally the second we came out here, there was planes going over, there's alarms going off. We're in the city. Oh man. What am I talking about again? So both Greg and I at this point in the morning are actually kind of feeling a little bit energized. Like I'm still tired and cloudy, but we really have a second wind and it goes with some interesting science. One of the main reasons that you get really tired is because something in your body is building up called adenosine over time. And the only way to really get rid of it is by either drinking coffee because it blocks the adenosine receptors in your brain or by going to sleep. Obviously we have not gone to sleep, so we have a lot of adenosine building up. But the other main factor is your sleep cycle and your circadian rhythm. So as the sun comes up, your body actually just starts to produce hormones that are in sync with the daylight, which wakes your body up. So in this case, even though our adenosine levels are high, as the sun's coming up, our bodies are actually waking up a bit. And as a result, we have sort of like a little up moment, but we are probably going to crash really hard later on as that cycle kind of phases out in the afternoon for us. Okay. Okay. Oh, you're going to get it. As our morning hormones that were acting as uppers began to wear off, we had to take another photo. And then it was the home stretch. This is awful. I need to go back to bed. Yeah, this is really, really bad. This is the worst. I don't know that I've ever really made it this far before without like having some serious thing I had to push for and then immediately crashing after. I haven't had any visual hallucinations, which is a good thing. No, not at all. I definitely have had just like major lapses though where we're talking. Oh, look at that butterfly. Imagine. Oh, that's like- I'm getting visual hallucinations that you would get. Wow. I can't even speak to visual hallucinations that you, oh my God, that you would just be like fuzzy little lines. It wouldn't be a butterfly. I don't think we'll reach that. Oh my gosh. That was too scary. The only thing that could help us get through at this point was mindless, but active video games as well as scrolling social media. I can't help but notice you're looking awfully cozy over here. I need to sit up. You're right. I shut my eyes for literally three seconds. You literally look so tired to me. Go look at yourself in the mirror. No, that's so weird. Don't look at yourself. Oh my God. If I saw me right now, I would be like, you're sick. Oh my God, we did it. Oh my God. Okay, don't look at me. I'm feeling better. I'm freaking out. This better have been worth it. We finally took the last photos and then went straight to bed. So we've had a chance to rest. And now we have the photos ready for us to see how bad we look. It kind of feels like the whole thing was like a dream. I honestly don't really remember the whole thing. So we'll know it once we've rewatched. But now I feel refreshed. That's why we look so snatched. Ready? Oh my God. Oh no. I look like I'm crying. Yeah, you do. Like your eyes are so much smaller. And you can see that your eyes are red, I think. I literally look like I have just been crying. Or I just saw that everyone I love has died. I'm actually more pale in the right one, which is rare for me. I have a very red face. Oh my God. I look so sad. My whole face is inflamed. Actually. I look literally busted. But also the one on the left looks really mean. You do have kind of an intense straight face. I 100% would stay away from the person on the right. I really would. I look absolutely pissed off in the more dark side. Yeah, you look sad. Even in my forehead, you can see I'm kind of like wrinkling my eyes. Probably because I'm like trying really hard to keep them up. Yeah, they say they're supposed to from not sleep get wrinkles around their eyes. That's maybe what they mean. I didn't know what they meant by that. To be honest, you don't look that bad. Like you're an attractive person. I think anyone would be able to say that's a tired person and that's not. Yes, and I would way rather hang out with the person on the left. And on the left you look hot and on the right I think you look hot. But I'm also just like a little bit worried like about you. A good takeaway from all of this for you is that yes, if you want to look good for your wedding, for a date, for one of those photo shoots where you like hug a pumpkin, it's important to get a good night's sleep. And as some people might say, you do need to get your beauty sleep. Thank you guys for watching. We actually haven't posted a video in about three months or so. Took a bit of a break and we've been thinking about trying different formats of videos and stuff. So hopefully you enjoyed this one. And we also just released a podcast about sleep deprivation with a lot more studies. It was filmed, will sleep deprived. So it's kind of messy, but it's very entertaining.

Your phone changes your brain, as the average American touches their phone 2,600 times per day. And this constant scrolling has altered your brain's neurology, so what would happen to your brain and body if you tried to quit your phone? After one hour of quitting, you have likely tried to pick up your phone three to four times, because the average person picks up their phone 52 times per day. After 12 hours of quitting, you may start to feel anxious, as not checking your phone actually releases the stress hormone cortisol. This is due to how your phone changes these three neural pathways in your brain. They are activated when anticipating or experiencing a reward. Your phone's TikTok notifications, text messages, or Instagram story updates all act as many rewards to your brain and physically change how these pathways work. In the new absence of your phone, cortisol is released because when you're endlessly scrolling or using social media, the positive social interactions reward the brain and cause constant firing. This causes a release of dopamine along these pathways in response to your phone's constant stimulus. Every ding notification, every thotty, sexy photo of someone on Instagram, a text message from a friend, acts as a mini reward that you now associate with picking up your phone. And these little associations become stronger and stronger in the noggin until you're just constantly picking up your phone, you know what I mean? Sometimes you're on the phone with your mom, for example, and looking for your phone because you're like, wait, where's my phone? It's usually in my hand this way, not on the phone. And then you realize that we're all in the crisis of the cell phone age. So after 12 hours of quitting, you are no longer checking your phone. This lack of stimulus that you're used to in your brain causes a stress response and you start to feel anxious. I hate this thing, but I secretly love it more than anything in the world. After 24 hours of quitting and one survey found that people began to experience FOMO, the fear of missing out, which led to increased heart rate, increased blood pressure, and more anxiety. Other people had increased anxiety, but they couldn't exactly explain why. It wasn't just because of FOMO, for example. But it is likely due to the fact that these tech companies have actually hijacked our brains using their reward prediction error encoding of our noggins. Tech companies have studied these neuronal concepts in order to keep you using their products. If you look at this dopamine activity and reward chart, you see that you learn behaviors when you get a reward without a cue. You keep behaviors when you anticipate a reward and it gets, mm, satisfied. And you change a behavior when you anticipate a good reward, but it's worse than expected, so you don't want to do it again. This is all linked to our human evolution ability to survive. We predict a yummy, yummy food. The yummy, yummy food gives us health. We learn the behavior. We continue to eat. But when applying this to our phone, we often can't predict what is going to happen when we check our phone. And with notifications, likes, and communication, we are mostly always rewarded by checking it, making us learn to constantly check our phone. Also, since checking your phone is such a low-cost effort, you expect small rewards and are mostly satisfied so you continue the behavior of checking your phone. The hijacking of these neuronal pathways means you have strong incentives to check your phone over and over and over. And again, now that you've quit your phone, the stimulus is removed, and that actually leads to increased anxiety. Day three of quitting is when most people start to feel the phantom vibration or phantom ringing of their cell phone that is no longer there. This is when quitting your phone starts to feel like a horror movie. You'll literally start to feel your phone buzzing in your leg even though it's not there, like a goddamn ghost of your old phone. But day three of quitting is when some good things start to happen because you may begin to be rewarded by your friends, your family, your lover, because you're actually now paying attention to them. You are no longer fubbing, which is snubbing your loved ones for your phone. Oh, loved one, please stop talking. I must snub thee, for I am looking at hot man lifting weight topless on Instagram. One study had participants view an animation pretending to be with a sexual partner. One animation checked their phone throughout, the other did not. The participants perceived the people who didn't check their phone as having a better quality of communication and increased relationship satisfaction. After three days of quitting your phone, you may start to notice that your relationships are improving. After day five of quitting your phone and your attention span may increase, you may even start noticing that you're doing better at work and school. A small study of college students who actively use their phones found they now focus on subjects for only 65 seconds. Another study of office workers who use their phones at work found they can only focus for three minutes at a time. But a study at the Carnegie Mellon University's Human-Computer Interaction Lab took 136 students and got them to sit a test. Some of them had to have their phone switched off and the others had their phones on and received intermittent text messages. The students who received text messages performed on average 20% worse than those who had their phones off. This is because your conscious brain can only produce one or two thoughts at once. Every time you open a text message or check a notification, your brain has to switch from task to task, creating the switch cost effect, making it harder for you to concentrate. But since you've quit your phone, you are switching tasks less often and you may start to notice your attention span increasing and your ability to do better work at school or even at the end job. After five to seven days of quitting and your cognition will continue to improve. A study of 660 people examined the analytical cognitive styles of its participants. On average, participants with stronger cognitive skills spent less time using their smartphones. The study went as far to say there may be a potential link between heavy smartphone use and decreased intelligence. Reading that study was a blow to the ego because I am known for using my phone a lot more than a lot of other people and therefore, yes, it's a bit of proof that I am dumb. After one week, a long-term study found that reducing cell phone use caused improved sleep. Some scientists argue that it is the psychological arousal of the phone that affects our sleep. Others argue it's the light from the screen. You know, you've heard all about the blue light, like, oh, it's burning my retinas, I can't sleep. There isn't any hard evidence as to why these cell phones are making you sleep less, just some surveys and large studies about people who use their cell phones less, getting better sleep. Do with that as you will. After 14 days of no phone, anxiety has decreased. Some studies even hint that you may have decreased depression. This is because studies have found that phone use may be associated with depression, although it is hard to say whether your phone causes depression. But one study found that teens who spend five hours daily on their mobile devices are 71% more likely to develop risk factors for depression compared to those who only use their phone for an hour. After two weeks, you will also have reduced neck and wrist pain. One study found that the longer you used your phone, the more likely you were to have neck pain. People who overuse their phone could also affect their hand strength. This is because of an increased size in your median nerve and decreased grip strength due to using your phone. The median nerve starts from your shoulder down to all your fingers, except your pinky on the palm side. This increase in size of the nerve from using your phone means that you have a higher risk of getting carpal tunnel syndrome, which is defined by numbness, tingling, and weakness in your hand. So after two weeks of not using your phone, you're potentially healing not just your brain, but your body too. Ah. Thank you to Fabulous for sponsoring this video because it is the only app that actually helps me with my phone addiction and other aspects of my life. By using science-backed daily routines to build better habits and achieve goals, Fabulous has helped me actually get things done in me dang life. It's a beautifully designed little app, and when I first started, I was nervous, so all I got it to do was help me wake up first thing and drink water, an easy habit that then spiraled into a bunch of other habits I now do from this app. Now it helps me with my writing routines, my evening routines that involve turning off my phone at 7 p.m. every day, sitting there chewing me nails, staring at a wall, not sure what to do, but this Fabulous app keeps me accountable. You can make it more self-guided, as I have to design plans for me to paint more, or you can have it be more guided through the app, and it can take you through a series of journeys that include nighttime mindfulness exercises or the creation of habits that the app decides for you based on simple surveys. It's a gorgeous little app, sometimes it even makes you reach out to friends in vulnerable ways, which is really cool. My friends are like, wait, why are you texting me nice things? I'm like, I don't know, this app told me to. And unlike my other apps, it doesn't waste my time, it actually helps me gain back time, improve my mental and physical health, and hopefully change my behavior to become a better person. Ding!

After an exhausting day, you brush your teeth, get into your Zelda-themed pajamas, snuggle up in bed, turn the lights off, and then... nothing. No, not the good kind of nothing. The literally 10 seconds ago I felt like I would die if I didn't get into my bed, and now I'm perfectly awake kind of nothing. So you try to squeeze your eyes tighter, or maybe I'm just not in a comfortable position? Yeah, that'll solve it. But no. The clock ticks, and you become increasingly more aware of every waking second of sleep time that you're losing and how increasingly bad tomorrow will be. If only you could have just slept at school or work. It was so easy then. But now, in the solitude of night, all you have is your deepest, darkest thoughts, and that damn clock that- Oh my god, it's been three hours? If this sounds familiar to you, then this video is for you. Because we've compiled some of the best advice and practices to increase your odds of falling asleep in minutes. And while we're going to start off with the stuff you should do before hitting your bed, we also have a technique used by the US Navy to fall asleep in two minutes when you're stuck there lying awake. So let's start with seven things you should do before you sleep. Number one is to sleep in a colder environment. Your thermal environment, especially surrounding your head and body, is perhaps the most underappreciated factor determining not only the ease with which you'll fall asleep tonight, but also your sleep quality. Whether you're overheating because of heavy blankets, pajamas, or just a hot room, it's been shown to decrease slow-wave sleep and REM sleep. Even just to initiate sleep, your body has to drop 2 to 3 degrees Fahrenheit or 1.5 degrees Celsius. And so being colder actually helps bring your temperature down faster. It might shock you, but the recommended temperature is around 65 degrees Fahrenheit or 18.3 degrees Celsius for your room. Going too cold isn't great either, but it doesn't have the same disruptive effects on falling asleep or your sleep quality as a hot room does. Number two is to take a hot shower or bath before bed. You might think being all warm and fuzzy is what makes you sleep, but it's actually kind of the opposite. When you're exposed to hot temperature, the body can't hold onto the heat and sends blood to the surface of your skin, giving you that flushed red appearance. Once you step out of the warmth, the dilated blood vessels radiate out the inner heat to your environment and your core body temperature plummets. This triggers the body and brain to think it's sleepy time. Number three is to put away the clock. Simply having the ability to look at and see the time and find out how much you haven't slept is not helpful and will honestly only stress you out. In fact, time monitoring is strongly linked to stress and waking arousal. Four, you should minimize or avoid caffeine and nicotine. Coffee, colas, some tea, and even chocolate can take as long as eight hours to wear out fully, and nicotine is a stimulant, so avoid them too late in the day. It's also worth avoiding eating too close to bed. While some studies show avoiding diets that are excessively biased towards carbs will help, it's better to just avoid being too hungry or too full before bed. Number five, exercising and being physically tired can help you fall asleep faster, but working out two to three hours before bed can keep you up longer. So earlier in the day is better, and same goes with naps actually. They're great, but don't take them after 3 p.m. or it'll be harder to fall asleep at night. Number six is to make sure you're actually relaxing before bed. If you try to sleep and you're wired or on, your brain just won't be ready. A relaxing activity within the hour before bed like reading is the perfect ritual to put you in the right mindset. And finally, number seven is to make sure you're getting sun exposure during the day and minimizing your light exposure during the evening. You've probably been told not to use your screen before bed, which is true, but it's equally as important to get natural sunlight for at least 30 minutes a day if you have problems falling asleep. This helps to condition your body's schedule and trigger tiredness at the right times. So now that we've set up some conditions for optimizing your experience of falling asleep, you're still awake. In fact, maybe you've already done those things and you're lying in bed right now, desperately looking up how to fall asleep faster on YouTube, which led you to this very video. Don't lie. In which case, you have broken rule seven of not looking at your phone, but I'll forgive you if it was in pure desperation. I mean, I won't complain about the extra view, but in all seriousness, if you're laying in bed after all that, there's a technique that the Navy allegedly used that, if practiced, can literally have you falling asleep in two minutes no matter where you are. I say allegedly because the studies are not publicly available, but they claim they were used on fighter pilots who would often make avoidable mistakes as a result of stress and ultimately sleeplessness. In fact, they were designed to allow them to fall asleep even while sitting up. And after six weeks, they claim that 96% of the pilots could fall asleep in less than two minutes. It goes like this. First, you need to systematically relax each part of your body. Take a deep breath, close your eyes and begin to focus on your face. Picture every muscle slowly relaxing. If you need help, squish and squint your face first and then let it relax. Breathe out as you feel your cheeks, tongue, mouth and jaw relax, even imagining your eyes sinking into their sockets. Then slowly make your way down your body and do the same thing to each muscle group. Tighten and then relax your shoulders, then arms, from forearms to fingers, chest and legs, and finally your feet, all while breathing deeply and focusing on the relaxation. Once you've gone through the whole body, focus on clearing your mind into a meditative state. As thoughts about your day or images pop into your mind, try not to dwell on them and let them pass. Simply thinking through motions can stimulate your muscles to involuntarily contract. Much like meditation, don't let the thoughts consume you. Try to focus on breathing in and out. Or you can visualize yourself in a calming location, like on a warm summer's day in a hammock swaying slowly back and forth. If you can't stop your thoughts, they suggest repeating don't think, don't think, don't think for 10 seconds. It may sound silly or fairly simple, but it's the practice that makes perfect. And anecdotally, online people have found it to work after dedicating time to it. But the key, like most things, is to consistently practice each night. It won't be a simple solution on your first night, but weeks in you'll be much more likely to fall asleep instantly, assuming you don't have a sleep disorder or other condition. Now, there is one more suggestion that is considered the single most important tip to falling asleep immediately, and if you can't follow any others, follow this. Go to bed and wake up at the same time of day, no matter what. Even the weekends. I know, it sucks, but we're creatures of habit and if you want to be able to fall asleep immediately, getting in a good routine will set up your body to literally work like clockwork. And after all that, if you still can't fall asleep, don't lie awake in bed. Studies show that not falling asleep for an extended period of time causes anxiety and only makes things worse. So just get up and do a relaxing or slightly boring activity until you feel sleepy. Thank you guys for watching. We played around with the animation style a little bit in this video.

So how are these popular gadgets changing your body and brain? If you're looking down at your phone right now, your spine angle is equivalent to that of an 8 year old child sitting on your neck, which is fairly significant considering people spend an average of 4.7 hours a day looking at their phone. This combined with the length of time spent in front of computers has led to an increase in the prevalence of myopia or nearsightedness in North America. In the 1970s, about one quarter of the population had myopia, where today nearly half do, and in some parts of Asia, 80-90% of the population is now nearsighted. And it can be hard to put your phone down. Take for example the game Candy Crush. As you play the game, you achieve small goals, causing your brain to be rewarded with little bursts of dopamine, and eventually you're rewarded in the game with new content. This novelty also gives little bursts of dopamine and together create what is known as a compulsion loop, which just happens to be the same loop responsible for the behaviors associated with nicotine or cocaine. Our brains are hardwired to make us novelty seeking, and this is why apps on our phones are designed to constantly provide us with new content, making them hard to put down. As a result, 93% of young people aged 18-29 report using their smartphone as a tool to avoid boredom, as opposed to other activities like reading a book or engaging with people around them. This has created a new term, nomophobia, the fear or anxiety of being without your phone. We also see a change in brain patterns. Alpha rhythms are commonly associated with wakeful relaxation, like when your mind wanders off, whereas gamma waves are associated with conscious attentiveness. And experiments have shown that when a cell phone is transmitting, say during a phone call, the power of these alpha waves is significantly boosted, meaning phone transmissions can literally change the way your brain functions. Your smartphone can also disrupt your sleep. The screen emits a blue light, which has been shown to alter our circadian rhythms, diminishing the time spent in deep sleep, which is linked to the development of diabetes, cancer, and obesity. Studies have shown that people who read on their smartphone at night have a harder time falling asleep and produce less melatonin, a hormone responsible for the regulation of sleep-wake cycles. Harvard Medical School advises the last two to three hours before bed be technology-free, so pick up a book before bed instead. Of course, smartphones also completely change our ability to access information, most notably in poor and minority populations. Seven percent of Americans are entirely dependent on smartphones for their access to the internet. A 2014 study found that the majority of smartphone owners use their phone for online banking, to look up medical information, and searching for jobs. So while phones are in no way exclusively bad and have been part of a positive change in the world, there's no denying that they are changing us. But many successful people have now decided to take smartphone vacations in order to increase productivity. In our new ASAP Thought video, we break down the top six reasons you should take a smartphone vacation and how it could benefit your life right now.

Do you ever wonder how your brain stacks up to those around you? Well, if you're standing tall beside them, you might be smarter. Researchers have already uncovered that tall people are often higher earners, which was hypothesized to be linked to self-esteem, social dominance, or discrimination against shorter people. However, a 2009 study revealed that taller children have higher average cognitive test scores. Or maybe you're the oldest sibling. A study of 250,000 Norwegian military personnel found that the first born had an average IQ 2.3 points higher than younger siblings. This wasn't genetically based, but rather the benefits of full parental attention. When you were a baby, were you breastfed or bottle-fed? A Brazilian study tracked over 3,000 babies to the age of 30. Researchers found that breastfeeding duration and amount was positively associated with IQ, education, and income. Speaking of drinking, alcohol is bad for your brain, right? Maybe so, but the intelligent among us are more drawn to booze. A study found that intelligent children in both the UK and US were more likely to grow up to consume more alcohol. Similarly, a study that assessed the IQ of 6,713 11-year-olds and then followed them up to age 42 found the same thing to be true for drug use like cannabis, cocaine, amphetamines, and magic mushrooms. Why would smart people seek substances that could harm them? Known as the Savannah IQ interaction hypothesis, it suggests that more intelligent people have evolved novel values and preferences. For example, while the majority of us function best during the daytime, the novel environment is the nighttime. Therefore, the hypothesis predicts that night owls are more intelligent. An analysis of the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health confirmed this prediction. If you find this information worrying, you're likely pretty bright. A sample of 126 undergraduate students found verbal intelligence was a unique positive predictor of worry and rumination. However, people who didn't worry scored higher on tests of nonverbal intelligence. Like daydreaming, a new study has found that daydreamers may be more intelligent, suggesting that people with efficient brains may have too much brain capacity to stop their minds from wandering. Are you a lefty? A study of 96 left-handed and 96 right-handed individuals found that lefties scored greater creativity as well as measures of divergent thinking, the ability to generate new ideas from a single principle. You have little control over being a lefty or a righty, but if you want to take your intelligence into your own hands, consider a music lesson. After only 20 days of music training, a study found that 90% of the preschool-aged children showed improvements in verbal intelligence. While you're at it, quit smoking. Unlike other risky behaviors, a study of 20,000 18-year-old males serving in the Israeli army found IQ scores are lower in male smokers than non-smokers. Maybe abstinence is key? A study that assessed 12,000 teens from grades 7 to 12 found that high schoolers with a higher IQ are more likely to be a virgin. A separate study found this extends into later years as well. By age 19, 80% of US males and 75% of females have lost their virginity and 87% of college undergraduates have lost theirs. However, when assessing elite colleges, this number becomes much lower. 56% of Princeton undergraduates have had sex, 59% at Harvard, and 51% at MIT. Also, do you find this picture funny? Congratulations! Your dark sense of humor is positively associated with intelligence regardless of age and gender. It's important to remember correlation doesn't equal causation, but it is interesting to investigate the variables related to intellect. So, how many categories did you fit into?

Since 2007, prescriptions have doubled in the US, and even those who don't have a prescription are using. An estimated 30% of university students use Adderall at some point as a study enhancer. But what happens to your brain on Adderall? Adderall is a combination of amphetamine salts, and therefore is, yuck, a close relative of methamphetamine, commonly known as meth. When Adderall is ingested, it takes effect on the brain within an hour of use. Adderall affects narrow receptors in the central nervous system, increasing the effect of serotonin and dopamine. In patients with ADHD, genetic studies have indicated that these individuals may have dysfunctional dopamine release. Because of the lack of dopamine, it is theorized that the brain is constantly seeking out stimulants, resulting in the distractibility commonly seen in ADHD patients. And dopamine and serotonin released by Adderall overcomes this deficit in ADHD patients, causing increased focus and making you feel less distracted. Adderall also causes the release of norepinephrine, which activates the sympathetic nervous system, initiating your fight or flight response. This results in your body moving blood and energy towards the major organs and away from your limbs and digestion, which essentially increases alertness. But in non-ADHD users, can it help you get better grades? To investigate this, researchers had 32 people without ADHD perform four cognitive tests. In one instance, they were given 10 milligrams of Adderall and was told it was Adderall. In the second, they were given a placebo, but was told it was Adderall. In the third round, they were given 10 milligrams of Adderall, but was told it was a placebo. And finally, they were given a placebo and were indeed told it was a placebo. The two groups that did the best were those who thought they had taken Adderall, regardless of whether they had or not. In fact, the group that did the worst were those who took Adderall but was told it was placebo. This is because although some studies have found that Adderall can increase repetitive learning tasks, it does not make a difference when it comes to most cognitive tasks or complex learning techniques like those needed for an exam. Any increase in studying skills may be from the fact that the drug gives you energy and can help keep you awake for a night of studying because, as we said earlier, it is similar in chemical structure to meth. The benefits of Adderall in academic circles is still up for debate, but the long-term detrimental effects of Adderall abuse are clear. Consistent release of serotonin and dopamine causes the brain to stop producing them naturally over time. Therefore, you need to keep taking more and more Adderall to get the same effect, making it highly addictive. Long-term users of Adderall developed an inability to feel pleasure without a chemical stimulant, and these effects can linger even after you stop taking Adderall. Adderall is a growing problem. So much so that millennials have been referred to as Generation Adderall. The abuse of Adderall in our culture is following a similar pattern to the current opioid crisis, which means, as a society, we need to put measures in place to protect people. Thanks to Sel, our editor, for narrating this video, and wow, turns out Adderall is pretty intense. But if you do need help with your exams or school, we have some scientific study tips and other advice over in a bunch of videos we've made. We'll put some there and in the description below.

One, there wasn't yet a way to make red pigment that wouldn't fade. And two, red is way harder to see at night. You see, your eye has three types of cones that detect color, red, green, and blue cones. But at night, there isn't enough light to activate these cones in your retina. And so your eyes rely on rods, which are much better at perceiving low light. And if we look at the wavelength sensitivity of rods, you'll notice they actually don't even pick up red wavelengths. When we see red at night, it can only be picked up by cones. And as a result, red is the hardest color to see in low light. So while a traffic light shining red is one thing, a lowly lit red sign is completely different. On top of this, even in daylight, our eyes are actually most sensitive to a yellow-greenish color. This is because it's right in the overlap between our red and green cone sensitivity, peaking at about 550 nanometers, making it a perfect option for visibility, but not exactly one for consistency with red meaning stop. So when did the switch to red signs happen, and how did we overcome this hurdle? It's actually one of the most ingenious and coolest inventions to ever come about, retro reflection. I'm here at 3M's Innovation Theater, the home of the retro reflector where it was invented, created, and first implemented, and we're gonna talk about what they are and how they work. I have a little laser light here, but to not blind you, we understand if a light comes into the mirror, it's gonna reflect back into this lens or your eye. But if you point a laser at an angle to a mirror, it exits at the equal angle the other way. So you can see over there, I have that laser pointer on the shelf, and that's not very useful if you're trying to get light reflecting back to someone on a sign, so we need a better solution. And 3M came up with that many decades ago. They first used these glass beads. Now, when light enters glass, it's a different refractive index, so it actually bends the light. If we put this down here, with the white surface that's reflective behind it, and I shine this laser through it, you can see that laser comes back to me now. Instead of bouncing out the other direction, it's actually shooting back at my stomach. A little faint, but still there. But 3M took that principle even further with a full cube retro reflector. If we take this and just talk about these first two mirrors here, if I shine a laser in one side of that mirror, it will bounce out at the equal and opposite angle, and then do it again, and you can see on me, this laser looks basically just as strong as it did going in as it does on me. So that's really useful that it's reflecting back to the source where it's coming from. And when you think about signage, you want the light to hit it, even if it's at a weird angle, and come back to you so you can see the thing. By adding a third mirror down here, we can now basically point anywhere on here, and we're gonna have reflection that ends up back towards me. You can see it here as well, even though I'm pointing on the bottom. And that is a basic 101 of how a retro reflector works. Now the question is, how do we go from the principle of retro reflection to getting it on a huge variety of surfaces, like not only signs, but moldable plastics, the lines on the road, and even clothing? Walk me through what the heck you are moving around here. These are our reflective sheeting. What we have here, different type of reflective sheeting. So these are all basically full of retro reflectors, right? Correct. This is full of retro reflectors. Basically each of these little squares has 6,000 retro reflectors per square centimeter. Yes, you did your homework. That's pretty good, then you got it. This though is like a metal backing of which these retro reflective sheets are put onto. Totally correct. The most important sign of the road is stop signs with over materials. I wasn't about to leave 3M without a sign of my own, so I made sure to ask specifically how the signs get put together. We're gonna start with the retro reflective sheeting. So we'll cut it to size. And our retro reflective sheeting is basically a big sticker. So there's a liner and adhesive on the back. So once you apply it on here, you get kind of this lip, this overhang. So we have to trim that off. And then separately, we'll take the electro cut overlay film or ECOP, as some people call it, and we'll put it through a friction fed plotter. We wrote ASAP science here. Yes, I hope I get to keep this. You just kind of grab the edge and just push it, and then you can just lift the letter off. Whoa. You can't go over it. Okay, there we go, all right. Some letters like the A will actually have a little floating piece, right? Like the middle. And so applying this pre-space allows you to keep everything in place and remove the liner. And essentially, you end up with something like this. So you remove the liner, the green is stuck to the white retro reflective sheeting, it's on aluminum. And the last thing to do is to remove this pre-space, which you want to give it a shot? I would love to. Are we ready? Oops. Wow. Beautiful. Hold on. Look at that. ASAP science. Almost every street name sign is made like this before digital printing. That's crazy. And another way to manufacture signs is using digital printing. So digital printing's been around for about 10, 15 years from 3M. So this is printing on retro reflective sheeting. Exactly. This specific printer uses HP latex inks, so it's water-based. So it's similar to like your printer at home, where it's just laying down ink. All right, can we see a little something, something? Absolutely. It's more ASAP science signs. That's so cool. Boom. Okay, we're outside in the dark and we're gonna do a little experiment with the sign now to see it in action. So if I shine this flashlight on the ground, my immediate surroundings are pretty visible, but become increasingly less visible as you go further out. And that's because light scatters in all directions and less photons are actually making it back to the camera lens. But if I shine this light now over towards Greg, holding our fancy retro reflecting sign and put the light right beside the camera lens, you'll see just how much brighter the sign is than almost anything else the light is touching, even though it's all the way over there. Now, of course, if I move the light away from the lens, the sign becomes less bright. Even here, I'm about six inches, go a little further about a foot, you can see how much darker the sign is. And that's because the camera lens or you are no longer the source. And instead, the majority of the light is bouncing back over here. Over here where I'm holding the light, I see the sign just as bright, but you don't. And that's because the light is always reflecting back to the source. You've likely seen this while driving at night when there are minimal overhead lights. Signs super far in the distance are extremely bright while things closer are completely dark. Even the metal post seems invisible here. Now, what about when it's raining outside? Sure, in the broad daylight, you can still see the lines on the road, but I think we're all familiar with that scary problem of lines disappearing at night. The problem here is that the water actually changes the refraction of light. So where the retroreflectors act ideally under dry conditions, as soon as water is on top of them, their refractive index is lowered by a ratio of 1.33. And so the light leaves at a different angle, sending less back to the source. And this is incredibly important because while only 25% of driving occurs at night, 55% of deaths from car accidents happen when it's dark, with rain being disproportionately dangerous at low light conditions compared to the day. To combat this rain visibility problem, 3M actually developed these elements, which are retroreflectors that have different refractive indices. So on this side, we have elements that have a refractive index of 1.9, and they work well in dry conditions. And on this side, we have elements that have a 2.4 refractive index and work better in wet conditions. And on top, they're both in air, and on the bottom, they're both submerged in water. And I'm gonna show you what happens when we're in the dark and shine a light on both of these. You can see that the one on the left at the top is optimized for dry conditions because it's flashing back more light. And then the one at the bottom on the right is optimized for water and is sending more light back to us, even though it's submerged in water. Now, of course, the best solution is to include a mix of these elements in the product, whether it's the layer put on top of painted lines or directly into taped lines so that people can see them in either weather condition. If it's dry, the 1.9 will send the light back, while the 2.4 won't, and when it's wet, the opposite occurs. So behind me, we have a variety of painted lines. Some have the regular glass beads on them, and other ones have the 3M elements on them with the 1.9 refractive index or the 2.4 refractive index or a combination of those. And we're gonna see what happens in the dark when they get rained on. Here's the setup in the dark before the rain machine has been turned on. And you can see all the lines are equally visible. But as the rain begins to run, some of the lines slowly start to become obscured and harder and harder to see. It's only the few stripes on this right-hand side that remain visible as they have varying amounts of the water reflective elements. And here's the difference in the real world. On the left is a wet line with out water reflective elements, and on the right, you can see it with these elements. And as a result, you can actually see that line even in the rain. So there you have it. Road signs are officially way cooler than you probably thought, or at least are a lot cooler than I ever realized they were before making this video. And hopefully I've convinced you of that too. I wanna send a huge thank you to 3M for having me at their facility and to JC and Gus for showing me around and teaching me and especially making me multiple signs that I could bring home back here to the ASAP Science headquarters. I will cherish it forever. Thank you so much for watching. Make sure you like the video, subscribe if you haven't already, and we'll see you next time for some more science.

Are boys smarter than girls? Early studies showed that male brains are 8-13% larger in volume than female brains, however this has since been attributed to differences in body size. Women's brains have more gyrification or brain folding and as a result a greater cortical surface area. Besides, bigger isn't always better. Berm whales, elephants and dolphins all have larger brains than humans and while they are smart their cognitive abilities are less than our own. There are other structural differences though, like males having more connections within hemispheres while women have more connections between hemispheres, but overall MRI brain imaging shows significant overlap in the physical structure between the sexes. After studying 1,400 brains and comparing the sexes, researchers found that mostly all men and women show a mosaic of female and male typical structures in the brain. This study also evaluated gender stereotypical behaviours, like how video games are often considered male behaviour while scrapbooking is female, and the results found only 0.1% of test subjects displayed only male or only female typical behaviours. Tests on intelligence find similar results with major IQ studies showing negligible or no sex differences in general intelligence, but do show women having stronger verbal abilities while men show stronger visual spatial abilities. Interestingly, studies show more male variance in tests with their scores being both the worst and the best. One meta-analysis of 22 studies did find men to be 3.3 to 5.5 IQ points above women, but this study has been called into question by academics who found the methodology flawed. In academic performance of language, math and science, women consistently receive better grades in 70% of nations. On SAT testing in the US, men score 33 points higher in math and science. Other tests, like the Programme for International Student Assessment, show both sexes performing equally in several countries, with girls performing better in some, like Iceland, suggesting cultural and environmental differences and not necessarily biological differences at play. But researchers found that stereotypes about women's performance actually impact how well they do. When told that a particular math test had significant gender differences, women performed significantly worse than their male peers, while women who were told there was no difference scored the same. This phenomenon is known as the stereotype threat. Even Google search data shows that parents are 2.5 times more likely to search, is my son gifted than is my daughter gifted, despite 11% more girls in gifted programs in America. And girls pick up on these biases as early as 6 years old. When told a story at age 5 about a person who is really, really smart, both boys and girls associate intelligence with their own gender, but by age 6 both girls and boys picked a male character as the smartest. In a similar experiment, kids were asked if they wanted to play a game for people who are really, really smart, and again at age 5 both sexes wanted to play, but by age 6 girls had decided these games weren't for them. And though women do strive to work in STEM fields, studies show they face barriers. In a double blind study, science faculty from research universities rated applications for a lab manager position. What they didn't know is that the applications were randomly assigned either male or female names. As a result, faculty perceived the male applicant names to be significantly more competent, hireable and deserving of mentoring, even though the applications with female names were identical. Males were also offered higher starting salaries, an average of 30,000 versus the females 26,000. Though these studies present a sobering reality, research does point to greater equality between the sexes with passing decades and education. And in spite of these barriers, women continue to contribute to our collective scientific knowledge. Rosalind Franklin allowed us to understand our own DNA, Catherine Johnson helped Apollo 11 land on the moon, and this year Miriam Mirzakhani is the first woman to win a Nobel Prize for Mathematics. Fellow mathematician Isabella Laba said, Mirzakhani's selection does exactly nothing to convince me that women are capable of doing mathematical research at the same level as men. I have never had any doubt about that in the first place. What I take from it instead is that we as a society, men and women alike, are becoming better at encouraging and nurturing mathematical talent in women, and more capable of recognizing excellence in women's work. To learn more, we ask the women at ASAP Science to speak personally about their experiences growing up and give insight into how they navigate the societal pressures of being a woman.

Let me get your diagnosis. Just as you're half the man I am and all your raps are necrosis. Yeah, I'm so perfectly perfect in all my careful divisions, creating identical versions while you're all in so different. Don't talk to me, you've been around the block too many times, and your duplicate splitting is constantly spitting out four-dot or neat, me I? Cause I'm sexy and I got two sets of phases. I like to mix DNA up when I'm entering my pro-phase stages. You're like your parents, kid. Just like a clone. You see, this chromosomal genetic combination's my own. I'm independent, my chromosomes don't need any pairs. At the end there's only 23 so your mom and dad can share and make life. Yeah, I'm the one that gives you your offspring, though my genetic variants can create arrogance. DNA's changed from New York to Beijing. Sure, if it weren't for you I wouldn't have kids, but if I wasn't here then you wouldn't exist. And those babies you keep bringing up, aw, real cute. I'm the one that makes them grow, so you can stop cleaning their peeves. You're like telophase, the only thing worth admiring is your cleavage. I don't want to give half of my chromosomes up, but I built them and nucleus is my achievement. I'm like telophase too, I like to kick back and unwind. But I'm secretly anaphase, pulling you apart from inside. I repair the whole body to make you grow big and strong. If I wanted set cells, I would just ask your mom. Hey, here's a question, maybe you have the answer. Did you know you're the main cause for a whole bunch of cancers? Yeah, your errors cause a lot of conditions. Ouch, did that burn bitter call the physician? Sorry, can't feel your burns as I can recur skin. I'll repair tissue, build membranes to never let you in. Whatever, I have meiosis 1 and of course meiosis 2. A way more complex process, making me way better than you. Two or six sets of divisions, four perfect daughter cells. Each one ends up haploid, is that your testes thanking me as well? And I was discovered first, in 1876 to be exact. So I'm older and wiser than you and that is a fact. My overabundance of detailed parts makes me a bit more complex. So my discovery required a lot more context. I come from Walter Fleming's genius mind, observations. Look at this cutie's beard, he'd give anyone stimulation. Well one of my forefathers had the hippest glasses and peach fuzz. Gertwig was a hipster before everybody was. You see it's me that makes the gametes so all of humanity can reproduce. Gotta strive for diversity and progress so we don't end up like you, a douche. Hey, hey, hey, both our chromosomes line up at the equator and we're mostly stuck in intervades. Let's try not to be haters. We're agreeing one thing we have at least is that both our epic journeys end inside of kinesis. We should hang out sometime. Yeah bro. Hey! Hey! We really hope that you like this song. We're gonna put a link in the description so you can get it on iTunes and Bandcamp and listen to it over and over and study the differences between mitosis and meiosis.

No seriously, if you close your left eye, stare at this crosshair with your right eye, and slowly move your head towards or away from the screen, the dot will disappear, revealing the exact location of your blind spot. The cells at the back of your eye transform light into signals that are sent to your brain, but they are missing right here because this is where nerves and blood vessels connect to the eye. So anything at that point in your vision you can't see, aka your blind spot. If we add a line through the image and you try again, you'll notice that your brain fills in information and makes you think the line is continuous instead of there being a hole in your vision. You also can't see all 12 of these black dots at once for a similar reason. Go ahead and try, chances are you'll only see a fraction of them at once. The exact point your eye looks at is focused, but your peripheral vision isn't great and so your brain often makes assumptions for what's there. Because of the consistent gray line pattern, your brain assumes the rest of the image is just like that and misses the black dots until you look directly at them. These two rectangles are flashing out of phase with each other, right? How about now? For most, the rectangles will now seem to be flashing at the same time in phase, but they aren't at all. And yet if we move these shapes beside them just a few pixels, you'll begin to see them out of phase again. The surrounding area has a direct impact on how you see and perceive things, even if the result isn't correct. Not convinced? Look at these flashing squares. Except what you might not have seen is that the middle square isn't flashing at all. If we remove the outer square, we see it for what it is, a solid color. Now try reading the sentence inside it. Did you catch the extra word? Your brain doesn't always notice mistakes like these because it doesn't affect your comprehension of the sentence and your brain would prefer to act quickly rather than to be perfectly accurate. Try staring at the middle dot in this illusion. When the picture isn't moving, the colors are clearly changing quickly, yet when the image starts rotating, the color change either seems non-existent or much slower. Our eyes and brain have evolved to see, but our vision makes assumptions based on learning, memory and expectation, and all of these illusions take advantage of this adaptation. It's an advantage to have rapid information processing, so instead of taking in every bit of detail to be one-off, so instead of taking in every bit of detail to be 100% accurate, which would cause a brain overload, your brain makes assumptions. This faster perception allows for faster reflexes and faster conscious and unconscious decisions, an integral aspect of human nature. Much like this halo, if you stare at the center dot for long enough, the brain will simply make it disappear. It makes an assumption that the information is unchanging or unimportant, and as a result, you can't see it. Love tricking your brain with illusions?

An estimated 87.2 billion dollars. Not to mention, traffic is just plain annoying. But is there a solution to your traffic woes? Traffic is often due to construction, an accident, or bottlenecks created by on-ramps and tunnels. But do you ever feel like congestion just seems to appear for no reason? You aren't imagining it. In a 2008 experiment, drivers were instructed to drive along a circular road, following the car in front of them while trying to maintain a constant speed. As the participants drove, they started to have fluctuations in the speed. These fluctuations increased, eventually causing cars to stop completely, which broke the free flow and led to traffic jams without any added factors. Researchers compare traffic jams to the particles in a liquid and a solid. Moving cars are like the free-flowing particles in a liquid, but can undergo a phase transition to that of a compacted solid. Once the particles, or cars, reach a critical density, gridlock happens. One of the key reasons gridlock happens is our inability to maintain a constant speed. When a traffic break happens, most accelerate to catch up to the vehicle ahead, resulting in eventual braking that forces the drivers behind to slow down, only causing the jam to grow. When you're in a traffic jam, you're part of the problem. Studies show that 80-90% of drivers think they're better than the average driver, which is impossible. Additionally, as humans, our attention is selective, and we tend to forget that other drivers are people too. Kind of like commenting online, we can dehumanize other drivers in ways we wouldn't face to face. This leads to jerks on the road, following too closely or constantly changing lanes, which contributes directly to the congestion that creates traffic jams. Thankfully, as the good driver you are, you can make a difference. Pay attention to the car ahead and behind you to keep a buffer of space around you. This way, if the driver in front of you breaks, you have room to slow down and won't pass the braking tension along the chain of traffic. Drive slower. Set your car to cruise control to try driving at a consistent speed. In Belgium and the Netherlands, there's a technique implemented at times of high volume known as block driving, where a chain of cars drive at a consistent speed to help others keep pace. Police have also used this strategy for 15 years, driving at an appropriate pace in groups to keep the flow of traffic moving. Of course, the advent of autonomous self-driving cars will see automobiles that are able to connect and communicate with one another vehicle to vehicle, and is expected to reduce traffic jams significantly. Additionally, researchers are using biologically inspired algorithms to reduce travel times. In one study, researchers applied a model based on ant travel behaviour as a way to route traffic. Changes in infrastructure work too. Recently, Los Angeles became the first city to synchronize every street light causing lights to make automatic adjustments based on flow, which has reduced travel time by 14%. Traffic aside, another solution is taking public transit when possible. An MIT study of Boston traffic found that if 1% of current drivers took transit, everyone's commute would be reduced by 18%. Of course, companies like Toyota, who supported this episode, are finding new ways to address mobility challenges, developing future technologies to interconnect drivers and vehicles with road infrastructure. Toyota is launching their new Corolla IM Hatchback with the Toyota Safety Sense technologies like Pre-Collision Systems, Automatic High Beams, and Lane Departure Alert, all of which will be standard and launching across Canada this September. They also have a goal to produce vehicles with zero emissions by 2050, which is something we really support.

Maybe some week we'll do riddles for dummies, but for now, are you ready for a new portion of mind-blowing riddles to solve which you'll need to apply all your logic and detective skills? That's a tough challenge, but if you're up to it, let's start! After each riddle, you'll have 20 seconds to find a solution. However, if you need more time, don't be too shy, simply pause the video! Alright, riddle number 1. Your task is the following. Empty one jar of milk and one jar of water into a bowl. Oh wait, you couldn't think this would be that simple! There are several conditions. You must be able to differentiate between the milk and the water. You can separate the milk from the water. And finally, you aren't allowed to use any kinds of dividers to keep these two liquids apart. Wow, that's a task even Cinderella didn't have to deal with! Will you be able to figure out how to separate the inseparable? 20 seconds for you to do this! In fact, all you need to do is to pour the water into the bowl first and freeze it. Then after that, just add the milk. And then you have milk on the rocks! Riddle number 2. There's a magician famous for the tricks he performs. One of such tricks is staying under the water for 10 minutes. However, one day John Smart challenges the magician, saying that he will stay under the water for 2 minutes longer. To say that the magician is surprised is to say nothing. He accepts the bet and promises John to give him $5,000 if he does beat the record. All in all, John wins and gets his money. How does he manage to do this? Do you think that John could be practicing not to breathe underwater since childhood? Or perhaps he's an amphibian? What's your idea? You have 20 seconds to make up your mind! To tell you the truth, John was cheating just a bit. He took a glass, filled it with water, and held it over his head for 12 minutes. Yep, always read the fine print on the contracts you sign. Riddle number 3. Sam Princeton is so unhappy with his life, so frustrated with his boss picking at him, and so angry with himself for being too weak to leave his job and start a new life, that he shoots himself right between his eyes in the bathroom. The bullets are real, the revolver is real as well. However, in just a second, Sam goes out of the bathroom alive and unharmed. How is it possible? Hmm, that's not a piece of cake. Or perhaps you've already figured it out. If not, you still have 20 seconds to use. The thing is that Sam didn't shoot at his real self, he shot his reflection in the mirror. Riddle number 4. In the city where people are keen on brain teasers and riddles, 4% of people don't list their phone numbers. So if we select 40 random people from the phone directory, how many of them will have unlisted numbers? Oops, seems you'll have to apply some knowledge of mathematics here. 20 seconds to refresh everything you've ever learned. The answer may make you indignant – you've opened your math school books after all, but it's 0%. If the numbers of these 40 people are in the phone directory, they are already listed by default. Riddle number 5. You have 7 guests at your birthday party, and you've got to figure out how to cut your round birthday cake only 3 times to make 8 equal-sized slices – 7 for your guests and 1 for you, of course. Time's a-ticking, and your guests are waiting for their cake, so get going! Answer? First off, you have to cut vertically right down the middle of the cake to make 2 equal pieces. Do the same thing but this time horizontally to make 4 slices. Your third and final cut should be laterally across the cake, which will quickly turn your 4 slices into 8. So how'd you do on this one? No worries, we still got tons more! Riddle number 6. A blind man had been dreaming of being able to see again for many years. This had been his biggest wish. After some time, his doctor confirmed that he could have an operation that would solve his problem. The man couldn't be happier. The surgery went well, and the man took the train to go home. The doctor allowed him to take his bandages off 3 hours after the operation. So the man was so impatient that he did this while still on the train. But as soon as he finished, he committed a suicide jumping off the train. His operation was successful, so why did he do this? 20 seconds for you to solve this mystery! Why could a man whose dream has come true kill himself? In fact, it was a tragic coincidence. When the man opened his bandages, the train was going through a dark tunnel. That's why the man thought he was still blind and killed himself. Riddle number 7. Your friend asks you for a favor and gives you $5 asking you to buy something to eat, something to drink, something to feed his cow with, and something to plant in his garden. At the same time, you're allowed to buy just one thing. What are you going to buy? To eat, to drink, to feed the cow, and to plant? Wow! Doesn't your friend think that's a little bit too much? Do you know the solution to his riddle? If not yet, you still have 20 seconds. You can go and buy a watermelon. You can eat it, you can drink it, you can feed the cow with the rinds, and as for the watermelon seeds, you can easily plant them in the garden. Riddle number 8. Once a king sentenced a man to death for a crime he had committed. However, the king was a kind man, so he allowed the man to choose the way he would prefer to die. But the man was clever and managed to say something that saved him from the capital punishment. Which death did he choose? You have only 20 seconds to figure it out, but if you need more time, don't forget, you can pause the video. Being a clever man, the culprit chose to die of old age. Riddle number 9. Two men are standing on the edge of an abyss on a wood board. One of them is holding a gun and wants to shoot the other one. But if the second guy falls down, the first one will fall into the abyss. Is there a possible way for one of them to survive? Who will actually die? 20 seconds for you to solve this dilemma. In fact, the thing is that the answers to this riddle are too diverse and everyone just thinks differently. So, what is your idea?

It looks like common sense isn't so common, because according to research, 90% of adults get these questions wrong, yet kids do just fine. That's because grown-ups overcomplicate things while children use their common sense and don't overthink. So follow their lead and let's start. Which word would you use if you needed to describe a person who doesn't have all their fingers on one hand? You have 10 seconds to come up with the correct adjective. You should just call this person normal. I don't know about you, but I have all 10 of my fingers divided onto two hands with 5 on each. 2. Alright we tested your anatomy, now some geography. If a plane crashes right on the border between Canada and the United States, where should they bury the survivors? Woah, are you supposed to know international aviation laws or something? Well take 10 seconds to figure it out. Have you made up your mind? Canada? USA? Hmm… but are you 100% sure they bury the survivors? 3. Ok, how about this one? Imagine that you just entered a pitch black room. There's an oil lamp, a newspaper and some kindling wood inside the room. But you only have one match. You have to make a tough choice. What will you light first? The oil lamp is definitely a good choice, but still incorrect. First of all, you'll need to light the match. 4. Mrs. Brownie, despite her name, loves the color pink. Her bungalow is decorated entirely in the bubblegum color. Pink carpet, furniture, curtains, even the walls are pink. So what color do you imagine the stairs are? Perhaps, if there were stairs, they would most likely be pink, but bungalows just have one floor. No stairs needed. 5. One day a man got caught in the pouring rain. Unfortunately, he had no umbrella or hat or anything else he could use to stay dry. Yet not a single hair on his head got wet. How so? The answer is so simple you'll want to slap yourself for not thinking of it. The man was bald. 6. How can it be that every single person in a plane crash died, but two people survived? This is a straight up paradox, and you have only 10 seconds to explain it. The thing is that those two survivors were married. Every single person. Ah, I see what they did there. 7. Time for a tricky one, so be very attentive. What do you sleep on, sit on, and brush your teeth with? A bed, a chair, and a toothbrush. Common sense, remember? Don't over complicate things. 8. In some months there are 31 days, in others there are 30, but how many months have 28 days? Come on, you know this one. You've got 10 seconds to remember. So, is it just one? February, right? Nope. The answer is actually 12. All 12 months have 28 days. Press the like button if you got that one. 9. A man dressed in all black from head to toe was walking in the middle of the road. All of a sudden, a huge black car with its headlights off came around the corner and screeched to a halt not to hit him. How on earth did the driver of the car see the man in black? And 10 seconds on the clock. If you need more time, just pause the video. Well, it's kinda hard not to notice a man dressed completely in black during the daytime. 10. There were three highly important rooms in the house of an extremely important man. One room was filled with valuable secret documents, the second one was full of money, and in the third room, the man kept expensive jewelry. But one day, an arsonist set the house on fire and all the highly important rooms burst into flames. Which of the rooms did the police start to extinguish the fire first and foremost? You can debate the philosophical stuff later, but let's get one thing straight, the police don't put out fires, that's what firefighters do. 11. What's the biggest problem with snow boots? That's a pretty random question. Still, take 10 seconds to think of your complaints about this winter weather must have. Snow boots melt as soon as you take them home or spring comes. Oh, because these ones are made of snow. Gotcha. 12. How do you put a giraffe in a refrigerator? So here's exactly how you do it. You open the fridge and put the giraffe inside. Then it's better to close the door so you won't let the cold out. This question in particular shows if you tend to overcomplicate things. 13. Now how do you put an elephant in a fridge? Alright listen carefully. Open the fridge. Take the poor frozen giraffe out. Put the elephant in and close the door. If you remember the giraffe, you're good at thinking about repercussions of your actions. 14. Noah builds one more ark and invites all the world's animals to join him. Every single animal gets on board, except for one. One animal doesn't board the ark. It's the elephant of course. It's still in the fridge, poor thing. If you got this one right, your memory is razor sharp. Very nice. 15. You're hiking in the wilderness when you come upon a river. You have to cross it, but you know that crocodiles dwell in rivers there. How can you reach the opposite side without becoming a crocodile's dinner? Don't worry. Just swim across the river. There's no danger. All the crocodiles are on Noah's ark. Did you figure this one out? If so, it shows you can quickly learn from your mistakes. Which question baffled you more than the others?

And I have met some crazy intelligent people or super successful people with zero common sense. So I get an abundance of emails and the topics range from everything to how to handle man boobs to, well, a lot of relationship issues. And now, don't get me wrong, a lot of the questions are great and they are super sound questions and I can see why the individual is having trouble with it. But most of the questions that I get leave me scratching my head and thinking to myself, go ask the third grader down the street. Because the answer is that apparent and doesn't take a degree in nuclear physics to figure it out. Have you ever heard the saying, if it looks like a duck, walks like a duck and quacks, then it's a kangaroo. What you see is what you get. Well, this is what common sense refers to, knowing the outcome based on some simple facts. So I'm dating this amazing woman and she is my soulmate. The only issue is that she has a husband and five kids, but you know what I really need to know, how should I handle this? Dude, I'm killing it at the gym. I just started like two weeks ago. Three times a week I'm going in there and I'm banging it out for about an hour. I have not changed my diet at all. I'm at 34% body fat, but I want to see my abs. Do you think I should do more crunches? But it's not just simple little meaningless things like this, it's big topics and subjects. I look around and I see that our society is losing its mind. Common sense is being tossed right out the window. Everything from like, I don't know, police brutality. I'm not, hey, and not to say that there aren't some horrible cops out there who shouldn't be cops, but hey, you don't want to get beat up by the police? Have you thought about not resisting arrest, running or reaching for their gun? What? That's crazy. Common sense has been a critical component of our survival as a species since the time of cavemen. Like, I guarantee that there was some cavemen who left his club in his cave. All of a sudden he sees a saber-toothed tiger walk in. It's dark, he can't see the tiger, his club is in there. Does he go in? No, because he realizes common sense tells him, I'm going to be a saber-toothed tiger dorderve. Now we may not have to deal with saber-toothed tigers anymore, but we still need common sense in order to survive. And so today we're going over some common sense improvement tips. Common sense improvement tip number one is try to remove yourself from the situation. Think about it like this. How much easier is it to give your friends, family members, coworkers, everybody else advice on things that they should do, could do? Sounds solid advice, right? It's easy when you don't have a horse in the race. But when it comes to us, we have a tougher time letting common sense lead the way in terms of making proper decisions. Gentlemen, remove yourself as much as possible. You will make better decisions if you can take emotion out of the equation. Tip number two is don't overcomplicate things. Keep it simple, stupid. That old acronym, KISS. Keep it simple, stupid. It applies. When you tend to overthink, overanalyze, and start bringing different things, well, they might have, but don't, uh-uh, no, no, stop. Keep it simple, stupid. It doesn't take a nuclear degree in order to calculate the potential outcome. Tip number three is trust yourself. You've got to trust yourself. That gut feeling, yeah, it's not going to steer you wrong. What happens is we feel that gut feeling. It might not be what we want to hear, what we want to do, or think, or say, or whatever, and then we start like, well, I don't know, maybe I'm wrong. I'm totally overthinking. You're not wrong. Listen to yourself. Trust yourself. Tip number four is divorce yourself from your reality. Understand that your reality might not actually be the real reality. We tend to, as, at least me, I sort of start to think things or do things as it relates to me and my little world and my preconceived notions and realities when I actually stop and think about it. A lot of times I realize that it's in my head or I've built something up or it's not actually happening. And so this is sort of a little bit abstract, but I hope that you understand what I'm trying to say is that you may think something is real and it's not real. It's in your head. And being able to identify and divorcing yourself from your own preconceived notions and your own personal reality is definitely a benefit when it comes to identifying and figuring things out using common sense. And tip number five, remember, being wrong is okay. We are fallible. Have you ever been with somebody or known somebody that absolutely under no circumstances can admit that they're wrong? Well, this is a very dangerous place to be as it relates to common sense because we may be making our decisions based on just trying to reinforce the fact that we are right. And when you do this, when you don't accept the fallibility of ourselves, this is dangerous because you will basically, even if you know that you're wrong or that you shouldn't be doing something, you'll do it anyway just so you don't have to actually admit that you're wrong. This is horrible. But something a lot of us do. Common sense. Where have you gone? We used to have it to fight lions and tigers in the jungles and stuff. Now it's like we can't get out of our own way. Common sense, gentlemen. You've got to use it before you lose it.\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 1031\n","\n","Link  356 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/ikzY4NQeR1U\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikzY4NQeR1U\n","[youtube] ikzY4NQeR1U: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] ikzY4NQeR1U: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 1.82MiB in 00:36\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Balance is important for me and you and you Balance helps us stand up straight and keeps us in our shoes Sometimes with technology, balancing's hard to do Yes, balance is important for me and you and you So gather around to hear our song, you'll learn these words are true When you look up from your screen when a friend says hi Share your game if they want to try Play outside when the sun is bright Devices go off when you say goodnight It makes your whole self happy when you're balancing, just try Balance is important for me and you and you Your heart, your head, your arms and your legs need that balance too Too much of something can make you mad or blue So trust your guts, get on your feet, there's so much that you can do When you ask before you take a phone Invite a friend if they're all alone Stick to sites you know online Go outside when the weather is fine It makes your whole self happy when you're balancing, just try Media balance isn't easy We know that this is true Just think about this balance song, it'll help you through\n","\n","The number of words in string are : 202\n","\n","Link  357 / 666  :  https://youtu.be/vNpkUyEOa_8\n","\n","Embedding...\n","https://www.youtube.com/embed/vNpkUyEOa_8\n","[youtube] vNpkUyEOa_8: Downloading webpage\n","Error: youtubeVideo.mp3 file not found\n","[youtube] vNpkUyEOa_8: Downloading webpage\n","[download] Destination: youtubeVideo.mp3\n","[download] 100% of 3.26MiB in 00:51\n","[ffmpeg] Correcting container in \"youtubeVideo.mp3\"\n","Download complete... youtubeVideo.mp3\n","\n","Transcribing...\n","Transcription:  Hi, I am seven years old. I love playing on my mom's computer, but I always get permission first. Mom, can I go on the computer? Sure, sweetie. I love my mom's computer because I can go on the internet. The internet is kind of like your neighborhood. You can visit cool places. You can talk to family and friends. And you can learn lots of new things. Like yesterday, I visited a zoo that's near my house. I saw a baby zebra. I took her picture and changed the color of her stripes. Then added a hat and added it to my collection of wacky animals. Awesome! Then later, I went to a place far, far away. I visited Kenya. That's the country in Africa. Lots of zebras live there. Wow, that's a lot of zebras. Sometimes on the internet, I talk to people I know. Like my grandma, who lives in another state. Hi, grandma! She's making me cookies that she'll send me for my birthday. Yummy! I wish the internet had Smell-O-Rama. I can talk to different people on the internet. Like my cousin. But I only talk to people I know. But what I like most on the internet is that I get to play a fun game. Score! I also like to draw and create new things. And share it with my friends. Cool! Sometimes I visit websites where I learn new things. But I always stick to websites that are just right for me. Wow! Dinosaurs! The internet is a super fun place. But just like when you cross the street in your neighborhood, you also have to be careful. When you go online. Here are three rules to remember. Rule number one. Always ask your parents first. Rule number two. Only talk to people you know. Rule number three. Stick to places that are just right for you. Wow! That was fun! Dinner time! I'm logging off now. I can't wait to get back on again to see where I can visit next.
