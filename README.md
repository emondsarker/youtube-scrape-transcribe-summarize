# Youtube: scrape, transcribe, summarize
This is a simple scraping tool that also transcribes and summarizes a video. 

There are 2 notebooks:
- *Youtube_DataScraper_Singular* takes in a single link as a console input then prints the transcript & summary to the console
- *Youtube_DataScraper_Automated* can be fed a csv of links with the Header="Link | Title | Transcript | Summary" and will store the transcription and summary in the original csv

Now skips links
